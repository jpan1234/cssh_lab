0,Shuler: We Can Make Dr. King's Dream a Reality,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-we-can-make-dr-kings-dream-reality,1-13-2023,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the 2023 AFL-CIO Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Civil and Human Rights Conference.Hello, everyone! Welcome to the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Civil and Human Rights Conference. And to those of you who’ve joined us from across the country, welcome to D.C.! I want to recognize the hard work that goes into bringing events like this one to life and just say a special thanks to  our Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond and his team, who have been tireless, as well as our union supporters at LIUNA, the Steelworkers, the MLBPA and Union Plus for their sponsorship. This year’s conference theme “Claiming our Power, Protecting our Democracy,” is so timely and important. Over the past few years we’ve seen the rise of misinformation, of political polarization dividing our communities, the rise in attacks on our basic freedoms like the right to vote and organize a union, and attacks on our democracy itself.And as a labor movement, we have to respond. We know how to use our voices to fight back against those in power who want to weaken and diminish us. We know how to leverage the power of collective action – and it’s by speaking together, in one clear voice, demanding change, is one of the best hopes our nation has not only for a continuing but also a thriving democracy. When I was thinking about all of you traveling from different corners of the country this weekend to celebrate the legacy of Dr. King, it called to mind the buses of activists and organizers and union members who flooded into D.C. for the March on Washington. This year marks the 60th Anniversary of the March on Washington. And while we can celebrate the progress we’ve made, the truth is that we have so much work left to do to make Dr. King’s dream a reality. Everyone here knows this, but it’s worth repeating hat march that drew 250,000 people to the National Mall to fight for equality in 1963 – it became known at the “March on Washington” – but the full title was the “March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.” Jobs and freedom. In the labor movement, we know that those two ideas are intrinsically linked. Good jobs – union jobs – help create the economic freedom and political power necessary to have real opportunity and real equality for everyone. They are twin pillars of our democracy. And when you look back to that August day 60 years ago, you’ll see that message ring out, time and time again from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. And one of the clearest voices on that issue was the labor movement’s own Walter Reuther. Walter Reuther was the president of UAW at the time, and he was the only white person to speak during the program. He recognized the privilege he had in that moment, and used his unique power and voice to call on everyone to join in the fight for civil rights. He said “the struggle for equal opportunity is the struggle for every American to join in. [That] men of good will must join together – men of all races, and creed, and color, and political persuasion – motivated by the spirit of human brotherhood.”  He knew that this burden, this fight was not for people of color to take on on their own. And that if white people did not link arms and join them there was no way to get true equality. Fast forward six decades later, we’re still in that fight. And I believe it’s white leaders and white people who need to speak up and lead. It’s white leaders who need to show up more in this fight. In 1963, Dr. King couldn’t get the support of the AFL-CIO. This movement was not where it is now. Now we know that all of our work must be done through the lens of racial justice. And Fred [Redmond] and I have worked together to prioritize that work at the AFL-CIO, building a Racial Justice Task Force not just to do a study and put out a report, but to inculcate racial justice into our work across the federation, every day. And we’ve benefitted so deeply from that task force and from Fred’s leadership and historical connections to the labor and civil rights movements. He has worked tirelessly throughout his career to weave the two movements together, to build on the work done in the past, and to lift up our shared values and shared goals and where we’re building toward in the future. Our movement owes so much to his work, his experience and his perspectives. I also want to recognize that people of color lead this movement forward every day in every corner of the country - in organizing efforts against major corporations, in community organizing, and on the picket lines. I look at Washington State, which just made history by becoming the first state federation to be led by two Black women – April Sims and Cherika Carter. I think about Striketober, when I had the chance to walk the BCTGM Local 358 picket line at Nabisco with Keith Bragg, who was leading more than 1,000 workers on strike over threats to the health care benefits of new hires. Keith knew that if they stood together they could win. He said: “We don’t sell out our young workers. We are fighting for the next generation.” And together, we won. When we fight for each other, we all win. We want people to see that - we especially want young people, people of color and women to see the labor movement as the place – as a home – to make change that everyone benefits from. That’s how we build the future and the country we all want to live in. That’s the future Walter Reuther called on people across America to build during his remarks at the March on Washington. He called on the crowd to “join together,  march together, work together until we have bridged the mortal gap between American democracy's noble promises, and its ugly practices in the field of civil rights.” He said “American democracy has been too long on pious platitudes, and too short on practical performances.”So let us – the labor movement – show this nation what democracy looks like in practice. Let’s demonstrate what it looks like to show up for each other, to speak as one and to fight for a democracy where everyone has the chance to live the life they dream of in a country that values them and respects them. No one person or community can take on this fight alone. And they don’t have to. This is what we do as a movement. That’s what the word “solidarity” means. So let’s show the world what we’re capable of. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
1,Redmond: We Must Be That Mighty Force for Change,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-we-must-be-mighty-force-change,1-13-2023,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks as prepared to the 2023 AFL-CIO Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Civil and Human Rights Conference.Good evening brothers and sisters. Thank you for spending your holiday weekend with us.Thank you to Clayola [Brown] and Civil and Human Rights and meetings and travel and everybody whose hard work is making this weekend happen.And thank you Liz [Shuler]. You’re a terrific leader and I couldn’t have asked for a better partner. You have shown us time and time again why you are the right person to be at the helm of the labor movement. President Shuler is union from the top of her head to bottom of her feet and she’s making sure everything we do puts workers of color and women at the center. That’s not just talk. She walks the walk and is making sure everybody is walking with her.Under her leadership, the AFL-CIO has recommitted ourselves to standing together with our friends and allies in the civil rights and social justice movements. Because we’re stronger together, and our shared missions of justice, fairness, and opportunity for all people, especially those in underserved communities, are uniquely connected.When labor and civil rights work together, we can be that mighty force for change that Dr. King spoke about.That’s the legacy of Dr. King. That’s why we’re here. To be that mighty force for change.But as Liz said, that wasn’t always the case. Labor’s support for the 1963 March on Washington was lacking. Many unions back then didn’t fully appreciate or address the issues of workers of color and women faced in the workplace.Unions set up councils and caucuses to address these issues but for a number of unions, it was just window dressing  – a means to appear as if we were doing something to address the issues.In 1963, white labor leaders offering true support to the civil rights movement were few and far between.  They withheld critical financial support, which meant there was a real possibility the March on Washington wouldn’t happen. In 1963, Dr. King asked George Meany – the president of the AFL-CIO at the time – for financial support of the March on Washington. He made a plea and was denied. Dr. King had made his connection to our movement known time and time again. In fact, when he addressed the AFL-CIO convention in Florida two years prior, he said that the two most effective voices for social and economic justice are the labor movement and the civil rights movement. Dr. King made an appeal for our two movements to join together to lift up the concerns of workers and those who have been disrespected, disinherited, disenfranchised in our communities.But his call went unanswered. Let us answer that call today. Because his concerns remain.Workers are still being disrespected. Workers are still being disinherited. Workers are still being disenfranchised.These issues don’t just affect their lives in the workplace. These concerns deepen inequality everywhere, in every aspect of life. And places where workers don’t feel valued or respected are a fertile environment for misinformation and disinformation to seed hate and fascist ideology.  And when those hateful feelings are fomented, they put our very democracy at risk. They lead to policies of voter suppression designed to take away the very tools that give us a voice in who governs us. Dr. King knew that. That’s why he knew that it would take both movements – the labor and civil rights movements -- working as one, to create true opportunity, true equality, true democracy. He knew a good union job protected workers from discrimination, and that union workers had higher wages, health care, safer jobs.He knew a good union job was often the first step in generating wealth and creating economic power. It made the difference for folks who had little opportunity … it allowed them to buy a home and save for retirement and give their kids a start with a solid footing. One by one those jobs supported and lifted up communities all across the country.A good union job was often the first step in reversing an unequal system that has caused generations of damage. And I say the first step because that economic power also translated into political power. At the ballot box and on Capitol Hill. It gave people a voice at work and in our nation. That’s why Dr. King worked so hard to bring together the civil rights and labor movements.[Pause]As President Shuler mentioned, this year marks the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington. Leading up to that march, in June of 1963, Dr. King went to Detroit where he joined other civil rights and labor leaders. There he spoke out against segregation and the brutal attacks of civil rights activists in the South. And about the challenges Black workers faced in Detroit and other cities in the North: inequality in hiring practices, wages, education, and housing. And about how the civil rights bill wasn’t “going to get through if we don’t put some work in it and some determined pressure.”People packed into Cobo Hall to hear him say that today’s march – where 125,000 people flooded the streets of downtown Detroit – was “the largest and greatest demonstration for freedom ever held in the United States.” What they didn’t know was that they were watching a version of the speech he would write into the pages of history two months later in front of the Lincoln Memorial. That he was starting an unrelenting drum beat driving the marchers to Washington. A few days after the march in Detroit, King said it was “clear that the masses of people are with this movement.”But he warned that “it’s your moment of greatest heights that could also be the beginning of your undoing.”What does that mean for us today? Unions have never been as popular in recent history as they are now. The Black Lives Matter movement has galvanized us like never before.In the face of attacks on our voting rights and our very democracy across the United States and especially in the South, millions of people are enduring the long lines and extra steps meant to dissuade us from casting a ballot – meant to prevent us from exercising our right to vote.We have an opportunity before us we cannot miss out on. We have the momentum. The masses are with this movement. We can’t afford to ease up. Let’s keep up the determined pressure. To advance civil and human rights. To advance social and economic justice.Together. The labor movement and civil rights movement working as one. That’s the legacy of Dr. King. That’s why we’re here this weekend. And it is our job to contribute to that legacy. To answer his call. Let’s stay connected. Let’s stay committed. And let’s build a society that is fair and just for all. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Redmond
2,Redmond: Technological Achievement Should Not Impoverish Society,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-technological-achievement-should-not-impoverish-society,1-6-2023,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond's remarks as prepared for the 4th Annual Labor Innovation and Technology Summit at the Consumer Electronics Show.Thank you Ben [Whitehair] and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us.I want to thank SAG-AFTRA, AFT, UNITE HERE and our Tech Institute for joining with the AFL-CIO to organize this summit. It gives us the chance to take stock of the opportunities and the challenges new technology presents to workers and our economy.Throughout our history – and in every industry – the labor movement has had to adapt to new technology. And we have. We are using new tech to organize and mobilize workers, and to help keep workers safe. Our unions are training workers and giving them the skills needed for new and emerging sectors. We’re partnering with universities and researchers at innovation labs – a few who are with us today – to get a clearer picture of the future of work and embed a worker voice in that important work.We’ve adapted and we will continue to adapt. We have to – that’s our job as unions. Working people are relying on us to continue to confront the challenges they’re facing now, and to shape the future of work and create opportunities for the next generation. How do we do that? By being at the table with employers, policymakers and other key stakeholders – by being at the center of every single conversation and debate about the future of work. The workers who are organizing and advocating and marching and striking are looking to us to make sure the benefits of technology and automation are distributed fairly. Because technology is neither good nor bad. And innovation doesn’t always have to lead to increased inequality. It’s a choice. We can decide whether new tech will benefit society as a whole, or if the gains will go only to the few.But time and time again we’ve seen our tax dollars go into government research and development that is then developed into world-changing technology. But the gains of our investment – the people’s investment – have not been shared broadly. They've gone to corporations and into the hands of the wealthy few.Our collective investment shouldn’t make inequality worse. It should lead to job creation here in the United States. It should lead to policies that connect those living at the margins to quality training and the chance not just to work, but to build a career through good union jobs.When Dr. King accepted the Nobel Prize, he hailed our nation’s “new and astonishing peaks of scientific success.” That we “produced machines that think and instruments that peer into the unfathomable range of interstellar space.” But Dr. King noted something important was missing. He said “there is sort of a poverty of the spirit which stands in glaring contrast to our scientific and technological abundance. We have learned to fly the air like birds and swim the sea like fish, but we have not learned the simple art of living together as [sisters and] brothers.”Dr. King was right. We can’t truly celebrate our achievements if those innovations divide us and deepen inequality. Our abundance of technological achievement should not impoverish society, it should be a source of shared prosperity and opportunity.And it can, through intentional government policies with the interests of workers at the center. Where strong unions can bargain for a fairer deal for the workers. And where workers have a voice across the entire innovation ecosystem – from the first stages of R&D to implementation. If the aspirations and well-being of working people are considered just as – if not more – important than the wealth of corporations and their investors, we can truly celebrate our abundance of achievements and our society will be richer for it.We have a lot of ground to cover today so I’ll stop there. Thanks again for joining us today. I’m looking forward to it.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Redmond
3,Shuler: Innovation Should Empower Workers and Expand Opportunity,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-innovation-should-empower-workers-and-expand-opportunity,1-6-2023,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler's remarks as prepared for the 4th Annual Labor Innovation and Technology Summit at the Consumer Electronics Show.Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you to our partners, SAG-AFTRA, UNITE HERE, AFT and the AFL-CIO Technology Institute for bringing us together and bringing worker voices to the big show across town. And it’s quite a show. Technology is shaping every sector of the economy – and it’s all on display in the Vegas convention center promising a future of ease and efficiency and progress.  But let’s face it – all that gloss comes at a price.  Corporate America and its investors think they should decide our future for us. And it’s a future driven by profits – not workers, not community.We believe in a future where innovation is used to make jobs safer and smarter, to upskill not deskill workers, to create opportunity for those at the margins through an equitable economy.  And we know we can only get there if we – if working people and unions – are driving those changes. Workers need to have a voice when it comes to decisions about technology.  No one knows our industries, our public sector and our jobs better than we do. No one has better insight into which innovations and inventions will make jobs better, safer and smarter and which will put people – from workers to customers – in jeopardy. Unions have always helped workers navigate the shifting sands of industry and our public sector. We do that at a local union level but also as a movement — advancing democratic values in the workplace and communities and giving workers a voice on decisions that will shape their lives and impact their families. And today is an important day to mention democracy – two years ago we saw democracy under direct attack, and were reminded that we cannot take our democracy, or our democratic values, for granted. The conversations we are having this afternoon about technology, are in direct relationship with this question of who decides our fate – our future. How do we bring workers' voices, perspectives, and power into the technology decisions that will shape our workplaces, our economy, and our society? How do we ensure a future of fairness and equity?Answering those questions is fundamental work for unions. And it is critical that we see this as a fight for a democratic future that works for all of us. And there are lots of opportunities to make choices that create that future.  We all know technology doesn’t fall from the sky.  Since World War II massive amounts of public investment have gone into developing innovations between government, universities and businesses – with workers usually left out. In this moment of great technological innovation and investment – we’re going to change that. We’re going to make sure that the investments in new industries and technologies coming out of the CHIPS and Science, infrastructure and energy bills are going to empower working people, create good union jobs, and expand economic opportunity in every community. We are already working on flexing that muscle and getting workers in the room. We’re developing policy reforms and forging deep relationships with universities that are helping us to not just get workers in the lab but also to understand emerging tech so that we can understand technology trends – promises and challenge – and the leverage the future workers deserve.  The labor movement has been evolving and helping workers navigate technological change for more than a century – so we know how to do this. But the stakes have never been higher, so we need to take everything we know and share it. Unions are driving their own innovations and strategies every day. Training the workforce for tomorrow.And it will take work and collaboration to get there. Our unions and the AFL-CIO Technology Institute are already paving the way forward and building a fair and equitable future – together.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
4,Redmond: We Need the Missouri Labor Movement Now More Than Ever,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-we-need-missouri-labor-movement-now-more-ever,8-22-2022,"Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks as prepared to the Missouri AFL-CIO Convention:Hello everyone. It’s great to be back in St. Louis.I want to thank my Steelworker Brother Pat White for hosting us in this great city and for your steadfast leadership and friendship. The Greater St. Louis CLC is doing such a terrific job advocating for all working people and for being engaged throughout the community.I know it’s been tough. The last couple of years have been one of the most challenging times in our history. And I’d like to thank Jake [Hummel] and Merri [Berry] and the entire team for rising to the challenge. For your commitment to the labor movement and dedication to Missouri’s working families. I know how hard you’ve worked.From the right to work fight, to Prop A, through the pandemic to this very day, you have shown workers all across this country the meaning of true solidarity. And what we can achieve when we come together and stick together.And America’s workers are taking a stand – while we put in the hours during the pandemic, it was major corporations who made record profits. And where did those profits go? Well - we saw the pay gap between CEOs and workers expand, so you tell me. Working people are only asking for what’s fair: a fair return on our labor. Safe jobs. Equitable wages and benefits that will support our families.To be able to retire with dignity. That’s what the 2,500 members of Machinists Local 857 did when they stood their ground against Boeing. They rejected the two-tier wage system. Said it was a non-starter. And they won a strong contract that not only improved their lives, but paved the way for future generations to have a solid job and a middle class life.And workers all over Missouri – especially young people – are embracing unions as a vehicle to speak up at work.There’s an energy out there. Just look at the number of union election petitions filed at the NLRB this year. It’s been through the roof. They can’t keep up.And Missouri’s workers are overcoming relentless union-busting campaigns and winning. In all sectors of the economy. Google Fiber contractors. Cannabis workers. Library workers. Workers are standing up to demand respect on the job and strengthen our communities.And Missouri labor has been there every step of the way. You’re organizing. You’re building capacity. You’re working with elected officials. Take the Painters and Allied Trades union in Kansas City, for example. They worked with city officials to pass an ordinance that puts an end to wage theft and misclassification. That’s a big deal. Because people are more likely to be ripped off by their employer than anybody else. That’s a fact. And those employers tend to target our society’s most vulnerable. It’s a labor issue. It’s a human rights issue. And it’s just one of many examples of how the labor movement is showing up for ALL working people.  And it’s an example of how our state feds and local labor bodies are at the heart of our movement. You’re closest to the problems and so are closest to the solutions, and Missouri’s working people know you are fighting for a better future and have their best interests at heart. You have earned their trust.We need to continue to build on that trust. Leverage it. And we have the opportunity to do so in this upcoming election. Because this year we’re going back to the basics. We’re going to have conversations with members at worksites. We’re going to listen. We’re going to hear what they have to say. Their struggles at work and at home. Hear what keeps them up at night.Just like in organizing, we’re going to build that trust. And then we can point to the candidates who will address those concerns and ease our struggles. The candidates who share our hopes and dreams and who care about working people and our rights. And I know we’re going to hear from a few of them in a little bit.Candidates like Trish Gunby. Working people in Missouri deserve a friend, a champion, a pro-union member of Congress. And it sure as heck isn’t Ann Wagner. Let’s send her packing and send Trish Gunby to Washington!Let’s reelect Brian WIlliams – a proven friend of working people – to the State Senate. And let’s strengthen that chamber by sending State Representative Tracy McCreery to the State Senate!And in the U.S. Senate, the pundits say we can’t keep our pro-worker advantage. But they don’t know the true power of organized labor and we have a golden opportunity to prove them wrong. Because Missouri labor is going to be the difference and we’re going to send Trudy Busch Valentine to Washington!Because this November we’re going to elect our allies and retire our enemies. We’re going to elect pro-worker candidates up and down the ballot.  We’re going to pass the legislation and policies that matter to working people.
We know elections have consequences. It’s our job to remind our members of that too. It’s our job to remind them who passed the American Rescue Plan and who created hundreds of thousands of good, life-changing union jobs in Iowa and across the country through the infrastructure bill.Remind them who is making major investments in energy and manufacturing supply chains. Who is lowering health care costs and making prescription drugs more affordable. Who is protecting our environment AND creating jobs with strong labor standards.We may be the only institution with the infrastructure and reach to cut through the noise, to counter the misinformation and disinformation that has divided our country. And it all starts with you, our state feds and local labor bodies. And this is just the beginning. We’re going to carry this model into 2023 and 2024 and beyond. Because our members need to know when our rights – to organize, to vote – are being suppressed. Our members need to know who – at all levels of government – are threatening our very democracy for their own personal gain.And these conversations will help us build our power. In the halls of government. In organizing new workers. And in our solidarity for striking workers.We need the Missouri labor movement now more than ever before. Keep organizing and mobilizing. Keep being a force for working people. Keep building a Missouri that works for all of us.Let’s show the nation what grassroots power looks like.Let’s show America our strength.Let’s show America our unity.And let’s show America that when working people stand together, nothing – NOTHING – can stand in our way!Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

5,"Shuler to Government, Business, Judicial Leaders: Give Workers A Seat at the Table",https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-government-business-judicial-leaders-give-workers-seat-table,8-3-2022,"President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared at the Big Sky Labor & Employment Conference:Thank you, Erin, and hello, everyone. It’s great to be here in Big Sky, and I want to thank our hosts for inviting me to join all of you and for giving me the opportunity to open up this conference on labor and employment with a message from the more than 12 million working people who are members of the AFL-CIO. I have the incredible privilege of representing the nurses in emergency rooms who helped our loved ones battle COVID… the meatpackers who make sure there is food on the shelves when we go to the grocery store…the tradespeople who are - at this very minute - rebuilding our nation’s crumbling infrastructure… and even your favorite NFL and women’s soccer players. Our labor movement spans industries and sectors, regions and states. Union members are found from coast to coast. And wherever you find them, you’ll find the people powering our nation’s economy. But you won’t often find working people at events like this. Powerful people talk about us a lot—but it’s not often they talk WITH us. It’s time for that to change. And I believe every single one of you already knows that. You know that because you’re seeing the same trends I’m seeing. When you look across the country, turn on the news, open Twitter...it’s the same story every day: working people are fed up. We’re fed up with working harder, being more productive, and watching other people take the fruits of our labor… With being called essential one day and expendable the next...But most of all we are fed up with being told to be quiet, get with the program, and it will all be alright.  But it’s not alright.  Not by a long shot. Record numbers of people quit their jobs last year, and I just saw new data showing 40%—40%—of workers want to quit their jobs in the next three to six months. Clearly the current system isn’t working for anyone. So at the AFL-CIO, we looked into these trends. We did a survey of 10,000 people and asked: Why do you  want to leave your job? And we asked: What do YOU think would make YOUR JOB better?And while many people said they quit their jobs over issues like income and pay—the reasons we’d all expect, more workers said that it was the way they were treated that pushed them to leave their jobs. Time and time again, we heard unfair treatment, poor management, and toxic environments were the worst parts of the job. So then we asked people: Do you think collective action could have solved your issues with pay and benefits, and management, and treatment at your workplace? And half of the respondents said yes. Half. And we’re seeing that belief brought to life. Working people are organizing everywhere—in breweries and coffee shops...REI and Apple Stores...stadiums and hospitals...universities and museums...in the cannabis industry...on Capitol Hill...and even on the ski patrol at the Big Sky Resort. And as far as I’m concerned those workers who are organizing, who are finding the courage to fight for a better life on the job—they are the heart of our labor movement.  When I’m out talking to people who are organizing, I hear so much talk about building a fairer system, with respect for the working people who make companies’ successes possible. And it reminds me of when I got my start as an organizer back at the local utility company in Oregon. My whole family worked for the electric utility company. My dad was a power lineman. My mom worked in service and design. And during college, I worked at the utility as a clerical worker. And I saw how the power linemen were treated – they had good pay, benefits and dignity. And I saw how the clerical workers were treated—basically the opposite. And I knew what the difference was right away: the power linemen were in a union, the clerical workers weren’t—so we didn’t have a voice on the job.After I graduated from college, the clerical workers decided to organize…to end the days of one set of rules for some and one set for others. They were standing up, taking a huge risk, and showing incredible courage to fight for what was fair. I wanted to be a part of that! So I worked on that campaign, then I went to work as an organizer for IBEW Local 125—and I never looked back. I’ve been organizing and fighting for fairer workplaces ever since, I just get to do it on a bigger scale now. And when I’m out with organizers or on picket lines with striking workers, I see that same call for fairness, for a single set of rules that everyone has to play by. Last year, I had the privilege of walking the Nabisco picket line...where more than 1,000 workers went on strike. Mondelez thought they could threaten to ship good, union jobs to Mexico if workers didn't agree to major concessions...despite bringing in record corporate profits. The company was trying to pit workers against each other by offering a two-tiered health care system that would've weakened coverage for new hires.But the workers there wouldn’t stand for that. When I was on the picket line in Richmond, Virginia I met two members of BCTGM Local 358, Keith Bragg and Darlene Carpenter. And they recognized that a threat to any worker is a threat to us all. They told me: “We don’t sell out our young workers. We are fighting for the next generation.”  That’s what the labor movement does. We stand together to fight for each other and for what’s right and what’s fair. And when we come together and organize worker power in our unions, we create a path forward for our families, our communities and our country. We create hope and confidence in the future. But when the only power is the power of organized money...and when the economy feels unfair, and political life seems mysterious and closed to working people, that makes the very foundation of our communities and our democracy unstable. That’s a threat to everyone. I’m sure you’ve been glued to the TV during the January 6th hearings like I have. It’s appalling to see the lengths a few people in power, starting with our former president, went to in order to undermine our democracy. But what’s equally worrying is the anger and frustration of the people in the crowd they summoned and manipulated–feelings we see across the country and the political spectrum.If we want our democracy to be stable and real, America needs to be a country where people have a way to have a voice…to have power and dignity. In the workplace, in their communities, in our nation as a whole. That’s what unions are: a way for working people to create for ourselves these fundamental things in life—stability… prosperity… a place to belong. That’s why large majorities of the American public support unions, and even larger majorities support specific groups of workers taking action—like John Deere strikers and Amazon organizers. And it’s why I see unions as a true pillar of democracy. Rule by the people - that’s what unions are at heart. And rule by the people is how we’re going to fix the challenges we face. So let’s talk about how we get there—to a real democracy that begins in the workplace. Because working people cannot continue to be shut out of the process if we want to have a healthy economy, a healthy society or a healthy democracy.In the labor movement we believe in dialogue. Negotiation is our lifeblood—t’s what we do. We’re not scared of a conversation – even when it’s difficult, even when it seems like there’s no way forward. Because we know that not talking is the only way you’re guaranteed to not make any progress.I am here today because I believe that if our country and our world are going to move forward—we need constructive dialogue between working people, business and government. But we can’t pretend we have dialogue here at Big Sky when actual working people in actual workplaces don’t have a seat at the table. Or when a majority of America’s workers say they want to be part of unions and their employers and their employers’ friends in government and on the courts make that impossible. We see those actions every day…From companies that refuse to bargain in good faith...fire people who organize...hold captive audience meetings...replace workers who are striking for better pay...or intentionally misclassify workers to deny them the legal protections that come from being an employee... From those who use the courts to aid and abet the union busting process and tell employers how to get away with breaking the law… And from public servants who have used budget cuts and endless litigation to limit the power of the NLRB...and who refuse to advance the PRO Act and create rules that level the playing field for working people. All of those actors who work so hard to silence working people would do well to learn the importance of having a two-way dialogue - quickly. I know we have a mixed crowd here, so that’s just some friendly advice. And if you don’t believe me, again, just look at the news, workers are fed up. There’s almost no better example of the need for companies to have an ongoing dialogue with and a respect for working people than Warrior Met Coal in Alabama. Six years ago Warrior Met filed for bankruptcy, but in order to save the company and the community, the workers agreed to make major sacrifices - to their wages, time off, overtime pay and healthcare coverage. Thanks to those workers, the company has been able to turn things around, but they still haven’t fully reinstated worker pay and benefits. So those workers have had to go on strike for more than a year. For more than a year the miners at Warrior Met have been facing financial uncertainty in order to send the message to the company that if we’re going to share in the sacrifice, we sure as hell better share in the success. But Warrior Met hasn’t budged. The strike has already cost the company millions of dollars in expenses and idle mines and billions in potential sales. It’s gotten to the point where even BlackRock Investment Management - the world’s largest asset manager and the company’s leading shareholder—has told Warrior Met that prolonging the strike is bad for business. The team at BlackRock must know the union saying ‘one day longer, one day stronger.’ Anyone who’s heard it knows trying to wait us out isn’t the best option. That’s why it’s better to come to the table in good faith. I have always believed that the best solutions are found by working together – that’s probably what drew me to unions in the first place. No one knows the meaning of those two words - working and together - better than we do. That’s why I see a future where unions and workers are integrated into every facet of our economy - so we can help develop better solutions that work for everyone. When I look at the way technology is changing workplaces, for instance, I see a simple truth: if you want to make smart investments in technology that will truly improve your workplaces—you have to start by talking to the people who will work with it. We know the operations of our industries better than anyone. We know that implementing new technology works better when workers have a genuine voice in the process, not just on the easy questions, but the tough ones that will never be surfaced through an “open door” policy. We need to be at every table creating the next generation of technology. Bringing working people to the table and upstream in R&D pays dividends for everyone. That’s why we launched the AFL-CIO Technology Institute, so we could bring the brightest minds in research, organizing, and innovation together. And as industries continue to shift and change, unions can continue to prepare workers with the skills they need for the jobs of today and tomorrow. Companies and unions can work together to build the next generation of the American workforce. Union training is already the gold standard, and it can give workers access to the upskilling companies will need to meet the demands of the future. I see a similar model for new industries—from clean energy to tech to cannabis. Collaborating with working people to build these industries from the ground up will create a solid foundation for new industries by creating a sustainable workforce that can help them get established and continue to grow. One of the efforts I am most proud to have been a part of is an effort with the building trades unions to help advance the investments we must make to fight climate change. We just signed a project labor agreement with the Danish offshore wind company Orsted to make sure that all of the construction jobs on wind farms all up and down the East Coast will be good union jobs. Together, we’re proving that this model works. And it must work if we are going to fight climate change effectively. If we can’t make new energy jobs as good as or better than legacy energy jobs, we simply won't make the change fast enough to avoid catastrophe.And I know that more companies are starting to get the idea that there is incredible value in valuing working people. I know that because I see their commercials. Like the Amazon commercials that tout the benefits they offer to employees and show smiling workers in warehouses. Except we all know those workers are leaving in droves – they leave so quickly that Amazon actually builds a 150% turnover rate into their business model. Or the car commercial I saw the other day that I could’ve sworn it was a union ad. This entire commercial focused on the hardworking people who assemble cars right here in America - it had the dramatic Morgan Freeman-style voice over, the close ups of smiling workers on the factory floor, worker’s signatures, you name it. The message was clear: our value comes from the people who make our product. If Madison Avenue can see the value in the American worker, I know everyone here can, too. But this recognition has to go beyond using workers as a selling point in your ads or your talking points. Every company now knows the value of socially responsible business practices - those start in house… your social responsibility starts with your own employees. And this next generation of job applicants are looking for you to take that responsibility seriously. They will be pushing you—and you have two ways to respond. And I want to spell out what choosing each of those ways will look like. You can go the path of Starbucks, where baristas have been joining together from Seattle to Miami to ask for basic things like fair pay, predictable schedules and affordable health care. In response, the company has spent countless dollars deploying classic union busting techniques. During an April town hall, CEO Howard Shultz went so far as to call their efforts to form unions a “threat” and an “assault.” You can imagine that hasn’t exactly slowed the workers down. In fact—since that town hall, more than 189 locations have voted to form unions and at least 40 more have filed to form them. Or you could go the path of Microsoft and its CEO Brad Smith, who looked at the direction their workers were heading in and chose a different response. They worked with the Communications Workers of America to enter into a labor neutrality agreement that applied at Microsoft and Activision Blizzard—because they recognized that enabling workers to freely and fairly make a choice about union representation will benefit Microsoft and its employees, and create opportunities for innovation in the gaming sector.60 million of America’s workers would join a union today if they could. This future is coming. You can fight it or you can embrace it. Every one of us can look ahead and see where the workforce is going - they’ve made it clear. I encourage you all to meet them there. Resistance doesn’t work—it will only widen the inequality gap, push people further behind, and create more instability and a less productive, less reliable workforce. We each have a role to play—in our companies, our unions, our courts, our government. Each of us can address the roadblocks that make it harder for people to organize, each of us can choose to stop putting them up. Unions are how we build the workplaces and societies we need to lead good lives – that’s something everyone should understand and support. Unions are the pathway that workers build to a better future for our democracy, for business, and for America. That ad I just mentioned earlier, that showed all those people hard at work assembling cars, ended with the line: You might not know their names, but these people get up every day working together to move us all forward. My challenge to you is: get to know our names…help us get a seat at the table…have the dialogue. And I promise that when you do, we will all move forward. Thank you. © 2023 AFL-CIO.

6,Redmond: Runaway CEO pay has Created the Perfect Storm for “Greedflation,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-runaway-ceo-pay-has-created-perfect-storm-greedflation,7-18-2022,"Good morning. Thank you all for joining us as we launch this year’s AFL-CIO Executive Paywatch report. And a big thank you to Brandon Rees, the AFL-CIO’s Deputy Director of Corporations and Capital Markets, for his work on this important project.We are calling this year’s report “Greedflation,” and you can visit our newly updated website by going to Paywatch.org.So what is Greedflation?It’s when CEOs force price increases onto working people as consumers while pocketing record profits and giving themselves a raise. In fact, according to the Economic Policy Institute, corporate profits have accounted for half of all rising prices since the economic recovery from COVID began. It’s another version of ‘more for them and less for us.’ And it comes at a time when working people’s living standards have declined with every increase in the price of food, rent, and gas. And the data from our Paywatch report backs our definition of greedflation up.Last year, S&P 500 Index company profits grew by a record 17.6 percent. And the CEOs of those companies received, on average, $18.3 million in total compensation. That’s an 18.2 percent increase in just one year.Meanwhile, workers’ real wages fell 2.4 percent after adjusting for inflation.So when you look at those numbers...and at CEOs trying to blame workers for inflation...it just doesn’t add up. They say that unemployment is too low. They say they can’t find enough workers to fill their low paying jobs. But the problem with our economy is not too many jobs, it’s economic inequality.
 
Last year the average CEO-to-worker pay ratio of S&P 500 companies was 324 to 1. In 2020, it was 299 to 1. And in 2019, it was 264 to 1. So to put a fine point on this, during the pandemic, the ratio between CEO and worker pay jumped 23 percent.Instead of investing in their workforces by raising wages and keeping the prices of their goods and services in check, their solution is to reap record profits from rising prices and cause a recession that will put working people out of our jobs.
 
The “heroes” of the pandemic – and by heroes I mean the working people who showed up and risked their lives and health and safety to keep our country running – are still showing up and working around the clock, but working for less.
 
Runaway CEO pay is most apparent in the consumer discretionary sector of the economy. This industry includes the goods and services that working people buy with their disposable income if they have anything left after paying for the basic necessities.
 
Last year, CEO pay at consumer discretionary companies in the S&P 500 Index jumped 79 percent. Their average pay was an incredible $26.1 million. And they made 872 times that of their employees. 872 times! But even that pales in comparison to the company whose CEO sits at the top of the Greedflation index of CEO-to-worker pay. I’m sure you can guess who it is — it’s Amazon.Last year Amazon delivered the highest CEO-to-worker pay ratio in the S&P 500 Index with a pay ratio of 6,474 to 1. Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy received $212.7 million in total compensation. What did Amazon’s median worker earn last year?  Just $32,855.Meanwhile, Amazon increased the price it charges for its Prime membership by nearly 17 percent to $139 in February of this year. And the company’s Whole Foods grocery store chain recently started charging new fees for Prime member home delivery.But working people are starting to fight back against the economics of Greedflation. From Bessemer, Alabama to Staten Island, New York, Amazon workers are coming together to form unions and negotiate for a fair return on their work.
 
And it’s not just Amazon workers who are exercising their freedom to unionize. Petitions with the National Labor Relations Board by workers to form unions jumped 69 percent in the first half of this year compared with the previous period in 2021.
 
Corporate profits and runaway CEO pay are responsible for causing inflation, not workers’ wages. That’s why we are calling for a workers first agenda to build a better America.We need to raise wages to help working people cope with rising prices, not make working people poorer by causing a recession.
 
We need stronger labor law enforcement to protect the rights of workers to join unions. We need to invest in clean energy infrastructure and manufacturing supply chains to make America more competitive.We need to lower costs for working families by reducing the cost of child care and prescription drug prices. And we need to fully invest in public education.These are real solutions to fix Greedflation and restore balance to our economy.And now, I’d like to turn it over to Brandon Rees, who will walk us through the rest of this year’s Executive Paywatch website.Thank you.

7,Fred Redmond Acceptance Speech at the 29th AFL-CIO Constitutional Convention,https://aflcio.org/speeches/fr-secretary-treasurer-remarks,6-12-2022,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond's remarks as prepared for delivery upon announcement of election results at the 29th AFL-CIO Constitutional Convention.Thank you, Liz [Shuler].Let me say how proud I am of you, how proud I am to serve alongside you. And how excited I am to continue our work together.When we were down in Alabama earlier this year in support of the Warrior Met strikers I overheard one of the mineworkers talking about you. He said, “That woman is union from the hair on the top of her head to the dirt on the bottom of her shoes.”He was absolutely right. You are union through and through. You are tough, smart and strong. And you are, without a doubt, the right person to lead the labor movement. Thank you.And to all of you – thank you for believing in me. It has been one of the greatest privileges of my career to serve in this capacity. Your support is truly humbling.Last week, me and my wife Anna, just celebrated our 47th wedding anniversary. We have been on this journey together, and I am incredibly lucky and incredibly blessed to have you in my life as the matriarch of our family. And I love you more and more every day.I’m happy to have my family here sharing this moment with me. My daughter Morgan and my son-in-law Mike Morris. My grandson Jordan and his partner Tabbie. And my other grandson Marcus is here too with his fiancè Sonia Warren, my granddaughter Anashia, and a special friend of our family Diana Warren. I also want to give a shout out to Becca Smith. You make a mean chocolate cake. I love you all more than you could possibly know.I want to give special thanks to my union, the United Steelworkers, and to president Tom Conway for putting my name forward and for your unyielding trust in me. The Steelworkers union has nurtured me and allowed me the opportunity to be a leader in our great union. And I will always be indebted to you and to former president Leo Gerard, who brought me on board. I also want to thank Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, for seconding my nomination. I am so honored to have his support and the support of the building trades. NABTU is literally changing lives. They have the most comprehensive training in the entire world. Their apprenticeship programs are giving so many people the opportunity to build a solid career. And their commitment to underserved communities is something everybody in the labor movement should be extremely proud of. Thanks again, Sean.And to my sister Liz Powell, who I have known for many years, thank you for your second, and for your commitment to racial and social justice. The work of the American Postal Workers Union and all the postal unions during the election of 2020 is not recognized enough in our movement. Their commitment to make sure every ballot was delivered and counted – while facing intense resistance from the Postmaster General – it took courage and is a true example of the labor movement’s commitment to democracy.And I’d like to thank the staff of the AFL-CIO. In particular Marcus Medley, Crystal King and Shari Cannon, our director of accounting and her entire team. And I would like to thank our team in the Secretary-Treasurer’s office – Tiema Perry, Mack Harrell, Jamie Garcia, and especially JP Smith. JP came over with me from the Steelworkers union, and I am very proud to have witnessed his development in the labor movement. He is not only the best executive assistant and chief of staff, but he is also one of my dearest friends. Thank you, JP.This is an historic election. An historic moment for the labor movement. I know the spotlight is on Liz and me right now, but I need to use this moment to recognize a few of the people upon whose shoulders I stand. People who struggled to gain respect in this movement, but who stuck with it because they realized that the labor movement was the strongest vehicle to improve people’s lives and build a Black middle class.People like A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin and Bill Lucy. Linda Chavez Thompson and Arlene Holt Baker. They’re labor legends for good reason. They were true pioneers in their commitment to bring the labor movement and the civil rights movement together. And in their unwavering advocacy for Black workers in the workplace AND in our unions. I learned from them that we have to get our own house in order first.In my own union, this moment would not be possible for me without Leon Lynch, the first African-American Vice President of the Steelworkers.And people like Oliver Montgomery, who spoke truth to power and challenged my union on issues of racial justice during a time when these issues were not being heard. Ola Kennedy, the first African-American woman to hold an elected office in one of our large, basic Steel locals. These are people who broke barriers in my union and opened so many doors for me as a trade unionist, and for so many others.But we all know that once you get through those doors, you need friends and mentors. And in my union, I’ve been lucky to find them in Leo Gerard and Tom Conway, in George Becker and Rich Breen and so many others who took a chance on me.And in Rich Trumka, whose commitment to racial justice was real and true. And I’m so grateful for his 25 years of friendship, and that he put his faith in me and in my good friend Marc Perrone to lead the 2015 race commission. And then in 2020, he trusted me again to lead our racial justice task force.He would have been proud of the progress we have made with the task force. And he would have been proud that the delegates of the labor movement he loved so much just elected a woman and an African American as its top officers.This is progress. Dr. King told us “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” I know that’s true. And I know it’s true because I see all of us, as a movement, working to bend it. Pushing for a better future.It’s not easy. And there’s no end to it. And it’s work we have to do together – all moving in the same direction.So where do we go from here? We reach out to meet today’s workforce, which has more women and people of color than ever before, and bring them into the fold so that the movement we love looks like our membership at every level.And we keep organizing new workers in new and emerging sectors – athletes, tech workers, workers in the clean energy economy – and workers at corporate giants like Amazon, Apple and Starbucks.And we keep fighting until every worker in this country has the chance to have a good, union job. Everybody in, nobody out. And we’re going to fix our labor laws and make that a reality.I know what the labor movement does. It brings the marginalized in from the margins. It brings respect to the disrespected. It lets people come together and collectively bargain for their own future. And it lets a poor kid from the South Side of Chicago rise up to become the highest ranking African-American officer in the history of the American labor movement.When you gave me your vote today, you gave me your trust. I will hold onto that trust – be accountable to it – every single day, for you and for every single worker in this country.Let’s keep pulling together as a family.Let’s keep bending that arc toward justice.Let’s win progress for America’s workers for today, for tomorrow and for generations to come.Solidarity, brothers and sisters.Thank you.

8,Liz Shuler Acceptance Speech at the 29th AFL-CIO Constitutional Convention,https://aflcio.org/speeches/president-ehs-remarks,6-12-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler's remarks as prepared for delivery upon announcement of election results at the 29th AFL-CIO Constitutional Convention.The U.S. labor movement is the single most powerful and hopeful movement for progress in this country because of you. I am grateful to all of you. Thank you for your confidence and thank you for your trust. Thank you to my family and friends for being here to celebrate this moment. Fred Redmond, we were a team from day one. We led the AFL-CIO through tragedy after Rich passed unexpectedly. You are a giant in our movement and I am honored to be partners with you. Thank you to my biggest supporters. Dave, my husband, we are together in everything, every step of the way. I love you. My friends Kim and Bob, who are here from Oregon. The Sunday morning crew. You know who you are and I appreciate the countless hours you dedicated over many months.My dad, Lance, I love you. And sister, Anna, thank you for always being the Captain to my Toni Tennille – we’re children of the seventies – and a wonderful mom to my amazing nephews Roland and Lance. And to the staff of the AFL-CIO, thank you for your hard work and solidarity – this has been a year unlike any other. I want to recognize John Sweeney’s legacy.I wish Rich Trumka were here. But we can feel his impact everywhere. I remember talking with Rich about his journey through the labor movement. He always knew that, one day, he was going to be AFL-CIO president. He worked at it, built his expertise and he aspired to sit in that leadership chair.I traveled a different path to reach this point. As many women in our movement do – we find ourselves outside the spotlight, doing the hard work behind the scenes, focusing on making big plans come together to benefit the whole.Often, we’re leaders because we’re good organizers. I learned that from my mom.  And from my dad I learned the value of hard work and a union card.My family’s story is an ordinary part of the greater working-class story.My dad grew up in a one-room fruit picking shack. He and his four siblings often went hungry. Right after graduating from high school he enlisted in the Marines, and went straight to Vietnam. And when he returned to Oregon, he found a job as a hole digger at Portland General Electric. But it was a power lineman’s apprenticeship that put him on the path to a good union job. That changed everything. In one generation, our family had a roof over our head and enough to eat. That’s the power of a union. That’s what IBEW 125 meant to my family. But my mom and I also worked at Portland General Electric as clerical workers, and we didn’t have a union. That difference showed me that in addition to good pay and benefits, the union also meant dignity, respect, and a voice. That’s how I got my start: by having one-on-one conversations with women who were my co-workers about a fair workplace. We decided to organize a union. Though we didn’t win that drive, it wasn’t a failure. Because something always changes for the better--relationships, possibilities, the way we define the future. The connections we built at that time helped us defeat a corrupt utility later on…many of us remember Enron.No matter the challenge, when we organize, we rise.I majored in journalism in college because I wanted to shine a spotlight on injustice. But instead of becoming the next Nina Totenberg, I fought for justice as an organizer for the IBEW. And as former IBEW president Ed Hill would later explain it, the west coast local that I came from represented power linemen. And at the time, they were all men. When he hired me, he expected to meet an organizer who was, quote, “A six-foot-four hunk who rode in on a Harley with his hair flapping in the wind.” All I had was the hair. But Ed gave me opportunity after opportunity and elevated a sister into the top ranks of the brotherhood. Thank you to Lonnie, my president, Kenny, Travis, Rick Diegel, Sherilyn and my IBEW family for believing in me. I am here because of you and all of my IBEW siblings.I stand on the shoulders of those who came before me--women whose dedicated leadership in our unions, in our workplaces, have moved all of us forward. There are too many to mention of course…but Linda Chavez Thompson and Arlene Holt Baker …. My teachers.My leaders. So much more is owed than just saying thank you. Together, we will stand up for equal pay, for our autonomy, and to identify as our true selves at work – he, she, and they. We are going to organize and rise together to break every ceiling – the ones made of glass…but also those made of steel and silicon.We will elevate women in our movement; center the people who have been excluded, paid the least but who, nevertheless, step up the most. My path and style as a leader are different. They reflect the shift we’re seeing in leadership in all walks of life. Less top down, more inclusive and collaborative. Because it's not about getting credit. It’s about results. And results are what the AFL-CIO is organizing to win.  Make no mistake: This is a defining moment for our movement. One million are dead from COVID. Promises for racial justice have gone unmet. Inequality is resounding. The middle class has been hollowed out.The wealthy concentrated power and profit away from working people. The upward mobility that lifted my family has been reversed. Millennials and Gen Z are backsliding with high rent, low wages and student debt.And yet, something is happening.  We are on the brink of something big. This magic. This power. Everyone in the room can feel it. We are standing up.  Working people are rising.Nurses walked out of hospitals wearing trash bags as makeshift protection against the virus. Then they returned with real PPE and won unions in Maine and in North Carolina. 19,000 graduate researchers in California stood up and won a union for more equitable, and inclusive universities.Baristas at Starbucks across the country are reclaiming what it means to be a partner. Corporate and retail workers are coming together to organize at Apple. Working people are rising and organizing. It is having a domino effect. Museum and stadium workers. Teachers and students.Hotel workers and bus drivers.Capitol Hill staffers. And cannabis workers. We are seeing breakthrough organizing in big tech…like Alphabet and Activision.We are rising so strong…that even Microsoft said it will recognize our organizing rights.Young, black, brown, and AAPI workers are leading us and building collective action.That’s because the path forward for climate action…racial equity and the movement for Black lives…disability rights…and PRIDE…runs right through the labor movement. People are turning to unions as a solution to their problems.And thanks to the Biden-Harris administration--the most pro-worker administration in history--we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It’s not enough to protect what we have, we’re not just going to recover what we have lost. This is about taking risks to define the future…on our terms.We are making the jobs of the future union jobs from the start. 80,000 in offshore wind. We are reimagining Appalachia and retiring the Rust Belt label. Everyone should know, after the U.S. military, we are the largest job training network in the country.We are the bridge to high-growth, high-demand careers. As industries change, we are the place people can upskill and reskill.Our apprenticeship programs have been putting people on the path to the middle class for more than 100 years. That’s what lifted my family.I want every working person in this country--women side-lined from the workforce…people of color written out of worker protections for generations…millions of immigrant workers waiting for their pathway to citizenship our formerly incarcerated siblings…the next generation of veterans…everyone should have the life-changing opportunity of a good, union career. As technology changes, we’re changing with it. We are working to make sure our tax dollars fund American innovation that benefits us. Everyone included. No community left behind. American-made industries...American-made supply-chains…all made with good, union jobs.  We rise. We organize. And through the power of collective bargaining, we transform. Over generations, workers, with the power of collective bargaining won higher wages, better benefits.We can use collective bargaining to meet our modern needs…like preventing employers from collecting data about us…or ending the toxic work culture causing the great resignation. And for anyone who needs to hear it, it’s okay, I’ll say it, You are more than your job.Elon Musk said the problem is Americans don’t want to work. The problem is we are exploited at work.Just look at Amazon.Where workers have to leave their dignity behind because democracy is missing from the workplace. But we know what to do. Democracy rises when we organize. We are going to amplify the voices of working people…our hopes, struggles, and demands.One conversation at a time, we will unite around shared values – the dignity of work, a good union job, and respect for each other and our diverse communities. This year we are building more than a “political program” – we are mobilizing for democracy.We will use our voices on the job and at the ballot box.Democracy is a practice not just an idea. It’s teachers and mineworkers and families on strike lines all around the country.It’s the strength and resilience of self-determination – just look to the people in Ukraine. While the richest men on earth might try to divide us, to colonize space, and treat us like robots…they don’t own our humanity and they don’t own our future. A new era for the labor movement starts right here, right now. Ten months ago, I asked our Executive Council to bring their boldest ideas to this question: What breakthrough do we need?While we supported new collective actions – behind the scenes, outside the spotlight – we strategized and analyzed, asked and answered, how? Well, we have a visionary way forward. Just as the AFL invested to create the CIO for industrial organizing in the 1930s, today, we are launching the Center for Transformational Organizing – the CTO. This is the vehicle that will accelerate and convert the energy of this moment to take our movement into the next century. The CTO will bring together the brightest organizers, technologists, and researchers. We will develop, implement and scale powerful campaigns for unprecedented union growth. By concentrating resources and coordinating to achieve the biggest wins, the CTO will use the power of the entire U.S. labor movement. That’s 13 million of us in 57 unions in every state, in every zip code, in all industries. And here’s the bottom line.In the next 10 years, we will organize and grow our movement by more than one million working people.Together. All in. One, single, transformational goal. We rise. We organize. It’s what we do.This is more than a comeback story. This is a new story, yet to be told. A story we will write, on our terms. To be written by every one of us.   A new era for all working people across this country.   And generations from now, they’ll tell the story of how we succeeded. Together, in solidarity. Let’s get started.Thank you all so much.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
9,Redmond on the 1937 Republic Steel Memorial Day Massacre,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-1937-republic-steel-memorial-day-massacre,5-21-2022,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks as prepared for an event commemorating the 1937 Republic Steel Memorial Day Massacre:Hello, everyone. I’m Fred Redmond, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO and a proud Steelworker.  As many of you know, I got my start just down the road at the Reynolds aluminum with Local 3911.So thank you all for inviting me back home to District 7. It’s great to be surrounded by my brothers and sisters and to see so many friends and friendly faces.Now, we’re here today to commemorate a somber event. We’re here because 85 years ago, workers were criminalized for having the audacity to stand together and stand up to some of the most powerful companies in America and call for better working conditions. Those steelworkers wanted a 40-hour workweek and a fair wage. They wanted to spend time with their family on holidays and have an occasional vacation.But Republic Steel and the other “little steel” companies denied these workers those basic needs. So the steelworkers stood together and went on strike.Now, most workers who go on strike have never been on strike before… and the Republic Steel strikers were no different.That Memorial Day was a beautiful Chicago day, and the striking workers brought their wives and sisters and children out to join them. It was a picnic atmosphere. A picnic with a purpose. And as that purpose took shape, and some 2500 people marched peacefully to the gates of Republic Steel, they were met by a line of city police armed with revolvers and billy clubs.And by private police hired by the company, armed with tear gas and clubs and hatchet handles.Some 250 law enforcement in all had formed a perimeter around Republic Steel. And they were ready for a fight.As the parade of workers approached the Republic Steel gate the police fired. Not just one officer ringing out a warning shot, but many shooting the striking workers in the back as they turned and ran away.Those officers pursued and beat and clubbed the striking workers who fell to the ground - their arms and hands raised to protect their faces.When all was said and done, a hundred people were taken to the hospital wounded.Ten people died. A man who worked for Western Union.A man from the Works Progress Administration. And eight of our Steelworker brothers from Locals 65 and 1033. From 1010 and 1011. We’re gathered here today to honor their lives, their work, their sacrifice. We’re here to reflect on this tragic event in labor history, in our nation's history.But we have to do more than reflect on the past or we risk the past repeating itself.Mother Jones once said that we should sit down and read and educate ourselves for the coming conflicts. I agree. We, as a movement and a nation, have a rich history. I’m fascinated by it. I enjoy it. Knowing our labor history, and our civil rights history, and connecting it to our movement today can help us be better prepared for the coming conflicts. It can prepare us to fight harder and smarter.So what can we learn from this tragedy? Well let’s start by looking at how the public learned about it back in 1937. Today this tragic event is called a massacre because that’s what it was. But in the following days the newspapers called the massacre of protesting demonstrators by an armed militia a “riot.”The striking workers were portrayed as agitators. As radicals. As villains whose demands for a more just and equitable future was beyond the norm - they were dangerous and they were to be feared by the public.It has been a common refrain about protestors agitating for change. Too often they are vilified, criminalized or ignored.We saw that in Selma in the fight for voting rights. At Kent State in the call for peace in Southeast Asia. And recently, across the country two summers ago for racial justice.Now in all of these cases, the brutality and terror inflicted by those charged to serve and protect the public was televised.And it changed the public’s perception.That wasn’t the case with the Memorial Day Massacre. It was not televised. Not because there wasn’t footage. There is. This event – this “riot” – was captured on film but it was so gruesome that it was censored over fears airing it would lead to an outraged public and mass hysteria.Maybe it would have. And maybe it should have. In any case, the public didn’t have the chance to see it. They couldn’t form their own opinion because they didn’t have the facts. Now, why is this relevant? Because the same thing is happening today. We are living in a country so divided that we’re being shown different versions of the world around us.There is so much misinformation and disinformation that one America is being fed one set of information and the other America the opposite. People are being intentionally misled and lied to. And because of that we cannot agree on the basic facts.It is clawing away at our basic right to vote and our right to organize, and it is undermining our electoral system and democracy. And it is leading to disaster. We have to pay attention. And we have to help folks separate the truth from the lie. We can be that trusted source of information for our members. We can share the basic facts. We can learn from the history of how false narratives were created around this massacre and make sure that history doesn’t get repeated. To do that, we need to go back to a tried and true strategy – face-to-face conversations in the workplace.We are going to have to listen first and build trust and then talk about the issues that matter.It’s not going to be easy but it is critical if we want to break through those echo chambers of social media and cable news that are pushing us apart. This is how we will reach our full potential as a movement. It is how we will organize and grow and fight back against anti-democratic and authoritarian forces.Because the attacks on our democracy are as real as the attacks on the workers here so many years ago. And like them, we need to be at the forefront calling them out. That starts with combating voter suppression and the anti-worker laws designed to silence us.And this is the time to do it. The wind is at our back. America is excited about the labor movement. We have the momentum. There’s an energy out there. We need to capture it.Workers across America are striking and standing up for their rights. And young people especially are seeing unions as the solution. They’re rejecting jobs where they risk their health and safety for a poverty wage.And workers across America are eager to join a union. Because a union job is so much more than a job.  It’s a career. It gives a sense of pride – a high quality of life – good health care and the ability to retire with dignity. And the sense of belonging in a broader movement of working people who are joined together in pursuit of the greater good.Who doesn’t want that? It’s our job to help workers join or form a union. No matter how big or small, each organizing win improves the lives of workers – better wages and benefits – access to health care – and makes their jobs safer and more secure.But our job isn’t done when a first contract is ratified. Our greater challenge is unionizing workers.What do I mean by that? It’s member engagement. It’s internal organizing. It’s educating and training stewards and union leaders and community partners to communicate the core values of the labor movement. To engage members. To show the value the union brings to their lives.That’s what we need to do as union leaders. As union members. As concerned members of the future of our communities and country.It’s our job to show all working people that the labor movement is for everyone – with women and young people and people of color – everyone.Because the labor movement is open to everyone. What other group or institution can say that? We accept everybody. And we need everybody. All workers must play a role in pushing our labor movement forward. Because diversity is our greatest strength. And an educated and engaged membership is our most powerful weapon. We have to be inclusive and unified. 100%.When we are, the possibilities for organized labor are endless. We can be a progressive force for justice – for today and for generations to come.

10,Shuler to IBEW: Let's Make the Most of This Moment,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-ibew-lets-make-most-moment,5-10-2022,"President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared at the IBEW's 40th Convention in Chicago:Good morning, everyone! And thank you, President [Lonnie] Stephenson for that kind introduction. You and Secretary-Treasurer [Kenny] Cooper are doing such an incredible job leading the IBEW, and I’m so grateful for everything you do here and for the AFL-CIO.Congratulations on your re-election. I’m so proud to be an IBEW member and to watch our union reach new heights under your leadership.And congratulations to the International Vice Presidents and International Executive CounciI members on their elections. And I’ll give a special shout out to 6th District VP Paul Noble, who just started a few weeks ago and already has the national convention in his own backyard—well done, Paul.It is an absolute honor to be here at the IBEW convention with all of you! I’m home. As you heard, I grew up in the electric utility industry when generations all worked at the same company, back when it was like a family. My mom worked in service and design. My dad was a power lineman and then later a Special Tester doing power quality work. I worked at the utility in college as a clerical worker in Payroll. I’ve seen the work up close, especially during ice storms and when the power goes out on Thanksgiving Day—our members answering the call in the middle of the night to keep people safe and warm. So, electrons are in my blood.And what I experienced and learned over those years is what I carry with me in my work across the labor movement today. Because I experienced the union difference. The power linemen like my dad had good pay, benefits, dignity and respect—because they had a union contract. The clerical workers, on the other hand—like the women I worked with in Payroll—didn’t have a union contract, and they were not treated the same. We didn’t feel respected or that we had the same security or ability to speak out without fear.After I graduated from college and the clerical workers at the company decided to organize, I wanted to be a part of that! They were standing up, taking a huge risk, showing incredible courage. So I went to work for Local 125—and never looked back.And fast forward to today—look at all the workers standing up. There are so many uprisings happening around us. People are fed up with the corporate greed, they’re fired up and organizing unions in a wave of activism we haven’t seen in decades. Young people are stepping up to organize at Collectivo coffee and Starbucks—workers at Amazon warehouses—university graduate students, workers at REI and in the cannabis industry—it’s a whole new generation of trade unionists showing all of us how to be bold and creative and fearless—because they are the future leaders of our movement.I was just in New Jersey, meeting with young workers who organized at Starbucks and in the cannabis industry. (And yes, to answer your questions, after meetings they do offer you edibles to take home.) And after our meeting we had a press event with the governor and the state AFL-CIO leadership. And we all spoke and two of the workers spoke, and then we opened it up for questions from the press.And we heard someone say, “Yeah, I have a question”—but it wasn’t a reporter, it was actually one of the young women onstage who had worked to organize the cannabis industry.We were a little surprised because that wasn’t really what we meant—it was a little unconventional, a bit out of the norm, but of course we gave her the mic. And she started asking about why the cannabis industry was using non-compete agreements, and talking about how they drive down wages and don’t allow people to reach their full potential.She saw her moment and she wasn’t afraid to make the most of it. She was ready to hold those in power accountable, to take a risk, and ask for more.And that’s exactly what we all should be doing. We are in such an incredible moment as a labor movement, there are so many opportunities in front of us and we need to make the most of them. We need to take risks. Ask for more. Try new things. Get out of our comfort zones.It’s not easy, and it’s not always going to work. And that’s okay too. It makes me think of our President Emeritus Ed Hill—and Lonnie and Kenny remember this—he used to say, “I’m not going to get upset when you make mistakes. If you make mistakes that’s a good thing—because it means you’re doing something, you’re making moves, you’re not just sitting still.And that should be our charge as activists and leaders in our movement. Let’s try new things and be bold and not be held back by the way we used to do things or the fear that something new won’t work. Because when you try new things you can bring in new people and fresh ideas.One of the Starbucks workers I talked with in New Jersey said they were using the company's own platform and channels to get their message out. Have you heard about this? When you use the app to place a mobile order, they’ve asked people to change their account names to “Union Yes”—so that when they called out the orders were ready, people in the store would hear “Union Yes” over and over again. I love that—such a simple idea that can help us gain momentum and new followers.We have to meet this moment with new innovations and ideas that show that unions are modern, relevant and the place to go as our workplaces evolve and change in the future.In Seattle, the AFL-CIO and affiliate unions developed a new Digital Hiring Hall that took the building trades’ Hiring Hall model and adapted it for other industries. That Virtual Hiring Hall is being used to fill hundreds of jobs at the Climate Pledge Arena, and to fill them with a focus on racial and gender equity. That’s going to connect people to careers they might not have found otherwise, careers that will change lives—help families move into the middle class—and revitalize communities—and people connect that the union is the place to go for that.We’re organizing in tech, in offshore wind, and other new and emerging industries to make sure we are creating good union jobs from day one. And the IBEW is the leader! Showing that when you include a worker voice and perspective upstream—and we are a part of the research and development of new technologies, that they can work for working people. We cannot allow a small group of billionaires to be the only ones who benefit—we want everyone to share in the wealth that these technologies create.The only way we can take on these corporate giants like Amazon is to organize. And do it together, across unions, across geographies—it’s going to take all of us. We saw this in Bessemer, Alabama. When working people came together at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer for that rerun last March, we had 15 unions and central labor councils and state federations who put more than 100 organizers on the ground. That kind of organizing solidarity hasn’t been done before and it should be a model for us in more industries and more places across the country.Look at what the workers in Bessemer inspired—we are seeing working people mobilizing in places that were once considered impossible. Amazon workers in New York, Starbucks locations across the country, and that’s inspired workers at Apple Stores in Atlanta and other places. Museum workers and cultural institutions, video game developers at Activision Blizzard, heck, even workers for our favorite political candidates’ campaigns and members of Congress on Capitol Hill!Working people are taking on the biggest fights there are and we are winning. This is an incredible moment for organizing. And the more people see it, the more they want to do it, too. We have to be there to help them.Organizing is where it all starts. And it should always be our number one priority. This is how we help people find life-changing new careers—bring more people into our movement—and build a movement that lasts well into the future.This is the time to do it. Thanks to your hard work electing the Biden administration—the most pro-union administration in history—and a pro-worker majority in Congress, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is creating good union jobs across the country. President [Lonnie] Stephenson—I know you were there on the White House lawn at the bill signing with the president, that’s how committed this administration is to unions.And it will be IBEW members leading the way in modernizing and maintaining our national grid—expanding the reach of broadband to more communities—and working on the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and public transit. Now it’s up to us to use this opportunity to shape the future of our country—to keep training new people in communities that have been historically marginalized—and to keep building our movement.So let’s double down. Let’s not just leave fliers at the high schools, let’s get in there and talk to kids and parents about the way apprenticeships can change lives. Let’s talk to that neighbor we pass by and let them know about the union difference when you become a member of the IBEW. Let’s keep pushing ourselves as a movement to think of new ways to work together and lift each other’s organizing efforts up. Let’s keep getting out of our comfort zones. They say, to grow, we’re supposed to make ourselves feel uncomfortable up to seven times a day.So start small—wear hot pink or try an Impossible vegan hamburger—you never know, you could like it—and then speak up at a press conference—or at a convention in front of 3000 people.While I have the mic, I’m going to channel that young woman in New Jersey and use this opportunity to ask for more. It’s a simple ask: With all the misinformation and disinformation out there, we are the only institution in the country that can access real workers in actual workplaces across the country, face to face. The simple ask is to have one-on-one conversations with your members. Talk about our shared values and our vision for the future, especially as we head into the 2022 election. Talk to them about the issues that they care about—reestablish that trust—listen. And only then, do we connect those issues to the candidates who will fight to address them.I know this is a difficult time for that ask. People are so polarized—we’re almost afraid to talk to each other about anything remotely political, I get that. But that’s exactly why these conversations are so important, it’s why our political program for the midterms and beyond is focused on these one-on-one conversations that help us break through the echo chambers of Facebook and cable news.Find those points of connection—we’re all feeling the pinch of inflation, we’re all worried about the economy, we all want to hold those who abuse power accountable. We can find points of common ground to start from—I know we can.This kind of relational organizing works because it builds on trusted relationships. If you talk to someone who already knows and trusts you—and more importantly, you listen to them—you can start to make real progress.IBEW knows how to do this, I’ve seen you take to Action Builder like nobody’s business. That’s the mobile-enabled tool we use for organizing. And what we’re talking about here is taking an organizing approach to politics. So keep building on it. And if you are in a battleground state, I hope you’re connected with your State Federations and CLCs to game out the larger worksites in your area and start your outreach plan.This is our moment, folks. There is so much at stake. The war in Ukraine, the talk of recession, the rise of extremist ideology. The future of our democracy, of our planet. That’s what this election is about—it’s a fight for our future.10 years from now, we’re gonna look back on this moment. Us right here together. And whether we answered the call to organize and grow our labor movement. If not now, when? If not us, who? Think back to our IBEW founders in the earliest days—at the dawn of electricity. Think about how much faith they were putting in the unknown, in a new idea. They knew it wasn’t a guaranteed success, and that there might be failures along the way. But they took the risk—and look at what they created.Let’s follow the path they lit. Let’s keep getting out of our comfort zones and build a brighter future together. I can’t wait to see where we go from here.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
11,Shuler: May We Continue to Live John Sweeney's Values,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-may-we-continue-live-john-sweeneys-values,5-5-2022,"President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared at a memorial service for AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney:Maureen, Trish, John, Kennedy—the entire Sweeney family—I know these losses never get easier, especially on days like today, John’s birthday. But I hope you take comfort in knowing how John and his values, vision, and work live on in so many of us.As I look around the room, and listen to the previous speakers, there is no one more beloved and admired than John Sweeney. And being here together today, on his birthday, when we are seeing working people rising up all around us, it makes me happy to think about his life’s work and what he’d be thinking about this moment in the labor movement.Six decades he dedicated to our movement—and what a model John gave us all to follow. One where we never lose sight of the critical role working people play in our country and we never stop fighting for justice.When John was growing up in the Bronx, his family, led by two hard-working Irish immigrants lived that American ideal—that this was a country where hard work could help you live the life you dream of. And throughout his life, John used every bit of power he had to help make that dream real for millions of working families across our nation.His childhood was also an illustration of the union difference—his mother who worked as a domestic worker had no one looking out for her—but his father, who worked as a bus driver, had the solidarity of a union behind him—providing him with safety and fair wages. Like so many other injustices he encountered, that difference never sat right with John. And he worked to address it every day because he knew that fundamental truth: Fairness is fundamental, and we are stronger together.When he saw working people being overlooked or mistreated, he took action. He would fight, he would negotiate, he would do whatever it took to create change.He may have been soft spoken, but his message was heard loud and clear. And he got results—time and time again.You’ve heard this afternoon a consistent theme—John’s drive in fighting for fairer wages and working conditions. Equity—he saw how the industry exploited the difference between male and female janitors by paying them less—and so he merged 32B with 32J to address the pay gap and create greater solidarity. He brought SEIU to new heights. And he pushed the AFL-CIO to become a new force for union organizing and mobilizing—because he believed so deeply in the power of joining together.So much of who John was, stemmed from his faith, which taught him that we are called to “encourage one another and build each other up.” And for him, it really was a calling.He worked tirelessly to bring people together and to build bridges, but he never shied away from a righteous fight. He put in the hours and never gave up on his relentless pursuit of progress. Even in the darkest moments, he would find that flicker, that glimmer of hope lighting the way forward.When John was running to be the president of the AFL-CIO, he ran on the “New Voice” ticket. He delivered on that promise. He was an innovator, always pushing our movement forward. That’s a spirit I hope to channel day in and day out by being bold, taking risks, and pushing for the future we all want to live and work in.John was called a “force for inclusion and activism” by President Clinton—“a legend, plain and simple” by President Trumka—and a friend and inspiration by many, myself included.When President Obama was awarding John the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011, he said, “Family. Faith. Fidelity to the common good. These are the values that make John Sweeney who he is; values at the heart of [the] labor movement.”May we all continue to live those values in John’s honor, and may God bless him and keep him.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

12,"Shuler: NABTU/Ørsted Partnership Will Change the Game, and the Future",https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-nabtuorsted-partnership-will-change-game-and-future,5-5-2022,"President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared at the signing ceremony for the unprecedented PLA between NABTU and offshore wind company Ørsted:Hello, everyone. I’m Liz Shuler, President of the AFL-CIO. What an incredible occasion to welcome you all here to the House of Labor for! It’s an honor to have this historic ceremony take place here at the AFL-CIO.We’re here for the signing of the Project Labor Agreement between NABTU and Ørsted—the culmination of years of hard work on a game-changing partnership that will change the trajectory of the entire offshore wind industry.At the heart of it, is a commitment—to build infrastructure that will reduce carbon emissions AND create high road, high wage union jobs that will change people’s lives. It’s also a model for the entire renewable industry—for solar and other emerging technologies to follow—one where labor standards and environmental performance go hand in hand—where we make the goal of green jobs being union jobs REAL—and where we build a future that’s better to live and work in.Coming out of the IBEW, I grew up in the electric utility industry. I’ve worked with the people who generate the electricity in all its forms—who transmit and distribute it across the country. My father was a power lineman and so electrons are in my blood. As we’ve seen the industry evolve and change, we know what the future holds. And that’s the opportunity for family sustaining jobs for generations to come. If we are intentional about our choices.And that’s why you see our Administration officials here like Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Director Amanda Lefton, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy.Because the commitment is there from the top, that the clean energy future will be union made.Sean McGarvey and Brent Booker saw the potential. We knew that if Ørsted had a commitment to fairness and union values in Denmark, we could work with our union counterparts overseas to make sure that model translated to the United States. We met with Ørsted’s senior management in Denmark nearly three years ago, started laying the groundwork and through a lot of patient and hard work specifically with Brent Booker and David Hardy, Troy Patton and Allison Ziogas, the work has come to fruition. Congratulations to all of you for this milestone achievement.You took a leap of faith—and thanks to that shared commitment to a better future, we are here today announcing that all of Ørsted’s projects to install wind turbines up and down the East Coast will create good union jobs. The National Offshore Wind Agreement is a first-of-its-kind agreement that has been authorized by 14 International Union Presidents (many of whom are in the room with us today) and their local affiliates.And this partnership really is a meeting of equals. This PLA pairs the most sustainable company in the world with the most skilled workers in the world. This is how we create a clean energy future that’s built to last.NABTU and its employer partners are the second largest provider of training in the country behind the US military. Our registered apprenticeships are the gold standard. And when we set up partnerships like this one, we make sure that the next generation of workers is ready to fill the jobs of the future, especially for women, people of color, and environmental justice communities who have been marginalized or not seen these jobs as for them. We need to make sure everyone benefits from the energy transition.We know that we have more work ahead of us to replicate these kinds of partnerships across the supply chain and in the maritime trades—to spread this model to new industries—and to bring low-road employers in the renewable sector up to union standards.This agreement between Ørsted and NABTU shows that it’s not only possible for unions and industry to work together—it’s good for business. Labor—management joining forces from the start with our community partners, government—means that everyone has a say in what the industries of the future look like—so we can build not only sustainable energy, but a sustainable future with good union jobs at the center.

13,Redmond: We Cannot Be Numb to Workplace Violence,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-we-cannot-be-numb-workplace-violence,4-28-2022,"Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks as prepared at the Allegheny County Workers' Memorial Day event: Thank you Darrin [Kelly] and the Workers' Memorial Planning Committee for including me here today.It’s a privilege to be joining you for Workers Memorial Day as we mourn the friends, family and colleagues we lost over this past year – here in Allegheny County and across America.The best way we can honor those we’ve lost – and keep their memories alive – is by having the resolve and determination to make our workplaces safer – for us, for our children and grandchildren. This is work we must commit to, because workplace injuries and illnesses and deaths are preventable. Everyone should be able to work their shift free from environmental hazards that cause disease. And everyone should be able to come home after their shift free from injury.But not all workers have that right. Some employers are not committed to the health and safety of their workers.The pandemic made that crystal clear. Workplaces were a main source of COVID-19 outbreaks. People were infected as they worked without access to proper ventilation and personal protective equipment.And when the Trump administration stood around with their hands in their pockets and failed to take action, we came together – workers and their unions – to demand access to the measures to protect us from inhaling the virus at work.We used our collective voice to advocate for laws and regulations that help protect workers. We won protections in states and we held our leaders accountable. We organized for safe jobs because we know progress doesn’t just happen on its own. We make progress happen. That’s what we’ve always done.Here in Pennsylvania, mine explosions used to be a common occurrence.In 1904, just down the road in Cheswick, some 200 miners were killed in a horrific explosion at the Harwick mine.In December 1907, 239 coal miners were killed in a mine explosion in Westmoreland County. They were among the 3,000 coal mining fatalities in that month alone.And 100 years ago this November, some 60 miles northeast of here in Cambria County, a coal mine explosion killed 79 people. Those 79 deaths were preventable. The mine had been rated gaseous and miners had been burned by gas on several occasions, but the new mining company insisted the mine was safe.The industry saw tragedy after tragedy. And these deaths started to become commonplace. Coal miners – many of them immigrants – paid with their lives to power the country.It wasn’t until workers came together, to fight in one voice for better standards and safer jobs that things changed.Thanks to them, job safety has improved. Not only in mines but in pretty much every other industry. Advancements in protective equipment and materials and technology have played a big part, that’s true. But unions were critical to having these new life-saving measures applied to protect workers. Unions also advocated for shorter work days and regular breaks to stave off the fatigue that we know can lead to tragic accidents.Working people are the major reason workplace fatalities and long-term environmental hazards have dropped so drastically.Our commitment to worker safety is in our DNA. When we come together we can advocate for laws and regulations that help keep us safe on the job. And we have to continue that work. Because even one death on the job is one too many. Here in Pennsylvania, 148 workers were killed on the job in 2020. And that number from the Department of Labor does not include the thousands who died from being exposed to COVID-19 at work.We mourn their deaths, and as Mother Jones said, we fight like hell for the living. Because workers continue to be exposed to extreme heat and extreme weather – to toxic chemicals and combustible dust – to viruses and diseases – and so many more unsafe working conditions.And while death is equal in the end, the risk is not. People of color are more likely to die on the job. The fatality rate for Black and Latino workers continues to be greater than the national average. And nearly two out of three Latinos who died on the job were immigrants.Now look, it’s the employer’s responsibility to provide workers a safe workplace. But we as unions can help hold the employer accountable. Workers in a union have a voice at the table on safety, and on scheduling and safe staffing levels.That’s a fact. A recent study found that union workers in nursing homes had lower COVID infection rates, and in turn, those nursing home residents had lower COVID mortality rates.And not just in nursing homes. We know that when all health care professionals work long hours and don’t get the resources they need, patients don’t get the care they deserve. And that leads to poor health outcomes for patients.Fortunately we have a president that is on the side of workers. The previous president rolled back worker protections and had corporate officials with a history of opposing enforcement and regulatory actions lead safety and health agencies.  President Biden, on the other hand, has taken important steps to protect workers and has appointed qualified public servants focused on worker protection to lead safety and health agencies. That includes naming Marty Walsh as labor secretary – a union member who knows what it is to work out in the field, where workplace safety is a matter of life and death.The Biden administration has made great strides to slow the spread of Covid, and has put measures in place to protect workers from infectious diseases and exposure to extreme heat.And they are also looking to reign in violence in the workplace, which has reached epidemic levels, especially for women. In 2020, workplace violence was the fourth-leading cause of death in the workplace overall. For women, it was the second-leading cause of workplace death. And women suffer two out of every three serious workplace violence injuries. These numbers are sobering - especially when we recognize that most of these workplace assaults were suffered by those seeing us through these challenging times – our nurses and medical assistants – our social service workers and first responders.And it’s bound to get worse before it gets better.Six out of 10 frontline healthcare workers say the pandemic has had a negative effect on their mental health. They’re burnt out. They’re worried about their safety, and they’re leaving a profession they love. And this creates more of a staffing problem for healthcare providers. And sadly, it increases the risk of being seriously injured on the job.We cannot be complacent. We cannot be numb. We cannot allow workplace violence to be a cost of doing business.Because these deaths and injuries are foreseeable and preventable, just as they were 100 years ago in the coal mine that exploded in Cambria County. Back then the labor movement responded by fighting for employers to provide stronger protections, we have to do the same today. We need to keep pushing the Congress to pass a federal workplace violence standard that would require health care and social service employers to take practical measures to protect their workers.And we need to continue to push for stronger worker protections from COVID-19 exposures and all infectious diseases.We need to do this work in honor of our brothers and sisters who we mourn and remember today. Let’s keep them in our hearts and in our thoughts and pledge that their deaths will not be in vain.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Redmond
14,Shuler to IBB: Unions Will Help Us Build a Better Future,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-ibb-unions-will-help-us-build-better-future,4-25-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler's remarks as prepared for delivery at the IBB's 52nd Annual Legislative Education Action Program:Thank you for that kind introduction, Warren. You’ve been not only a true leader for the Boilermakers, but a thought leader on our Executive Council at the AFL-CIO. Not to mention a true friend and brother—I appreciate you so much.Good morning, everyone. I’m so excited to be here with you this morning and to welcome you to Washington! Your legislative conference is happening just at the right time! And as you know, DC can be quite a circus—most of you coming from out of town are like “I’m so glad I don’t live here.”But luckily you have an incredible leadership team to help us make sense of it all—of course, Warren, but I’m talking about President [Newton] Jones, Secretary-Treasurer [William] Creeden, International Vice President John Fultz and International Vice President Lawrence McManamon. But most importantly we have all of you here to wake all those people up on Capitol Hill, and bring some reality into the conversation and the voices of your members in your home states.And what an exciting moment it is for our movement across the country!We have one of the most pro-union administrations in history. We have a union leader—a building tradesman—as Secretary of Labor. And we have a President who is putting working people at the center of his policies, his plans for the recovery and for the future.The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act—which is already helping us create millions of good union jobs to fix our roads and bridges, our ports and airports, our railroads and so much more. Every one of those new jobs is a chance for us to grow our movement.But it’s on us to get out there at the community level and recruit that new talent as these jobs come online. Especially the communities of color and women who might not think infrastructure jobs are for them—we need to change that perception. Talk to the kid you pass by and reach out a hand to the next generation. Let’s show them what the union difference means.Because these projects are going to have PLAs. They are going to create jobs with Davis-Bacon prevailing wages. They are going to show a new generation what it means to turn a job into a career.Where’s the Pennsylvania contingent? I was just reading about one of your own, a member of Local 1506 named Barry Batz, a metal forger who went to his first day on the job at the Phoenix Forge Group at 19 years old, in 1971, and has been there ever since. That’s 50 years in one job. That’s incredible. What may be even more incredible is that after that first day at the forge Barry went home and proposed to his wife and they are also still going strong 50 years later. Clearly he understands the value of a good union in more ways than one.We know unions offer people the kind of lifelong career opportunity Barry’s had. We need to make sure that careers like his are available to more people, and extend that path to good-paying, family supporting jobs as far as it can go. Because people across the country are excited about the idea of organizing and using their collective power—and we need to meet them where they are.We are seeing unprecedented organizing efforts in new areas and new industries. Working people are fighting uphill battles against corporate giants like Starbucks and Amazon—and we are winning.So now our job is to take this momentum and use it to build a movement that can meet this moment and help us build a future where working people not only drive innovation and progress but also get to benefit from it.So let’s show our value to new people and in new ways—with our ideas and inventions, with our contracts and our trainings, and with our support in the workplace and our advocacy for our community.I know you all are headed to the Hill this afternoon, and the conversations you have there with your Senators and Representatives about the future we want to build are going to help us deliver real change for working people. We’re going to help them see that when we look to the future, we need to do it through the workers’ lens.At the AFL-CIO, we’re doing that through our Workers First Agenda, and it includes so much of what you plan to talk to your members about today.That starts with the PRO Act, which is a top priority across the labor movement. Unions have almost never been more popular—national polling shows two in three Americans support unions. And, at the AFL-CIO, our own research found that half of the workforce believes that collective action could solve the issues in their workplace.So, the question is: if organizing is so popular, why aren’t we seeing more of it? And we know the answer. It’s because our outdated labor laws have tipped the scales in employers’ favor.Employers are getting away with violating workers’ right to organize and collectively bargain because the current law doesn’t hold employers accountable with penalties. Key provisions of the PRO Act would change that, and our senators need to hear about what that would mean for you and for people in your states. They need to hear about how the right to organize is the key to rebuilding our middle class and our economy.They also need to hear about how the path to a clean energy future goes straight through the labor movement. Reaching our national climate goals will take an all-hands-on-deck, multifaceted approach.We know that solutions like carbon capture need to play a critical role in meeting those goals—and that is supported by the scientists. Preserving existing nuclear plants and building advanced nuclear plants will be critical. Offshore wind is also a big deal, and we need more U.S.-built vessels for that industry. Hydrogen for power plants. These will all create jobs for boilermakers.And as more new energy industries and technologies come on line, those companies are going to need the best talent available to build them—and that’s you all, so let’s keep working to make sure clean energy jobs will be good, union jobs from day one. We can build a future where we create all kinds of energy here in the US and do it with high labor and environmental standards.Building and making more here in America is critical to our national economy and our national security. That’s why it’s so important that the House and Senate come together on the bipartisan Innovation Act and include rules for fair trade that help us keep jobs in America.Unions are going to help us build a better future—just as they always have. That future starts with you—all of you in this room. Boilermakers helped us connect the global market through the Panama Canal, win two world wars and go to space. And I know that all of you are going to keep that tradition alive and keep bringing us to new heights.Together, we’ll keep advocating with policies and picket lines and every other tool we have. And we’ll keep fighting until we make high-road, high-wage jobs available to every worker in every community.Our members and working people across the country are fed up and fired up. Let’s show them that the labor movement has their back.Let’s keep our foot on the gas.And let’s build an economy that works for working people. Everyone included, no one left behind.I can’t wait to see where we go from here.Thank you. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
15,Shuler: Labor and Climate Issues Are Two Sides of the Same Coin,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-labor-and-climate-issues-are-two-sides-same-coin,4-23-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler's remarks as prepared for delivery at the Fight for Our Future Earth Day Climate Rally:Hello, everyone! I’m Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, representing 12.5 million working people across the country in 57 unions who are going to help us build the clean energy future.Thank you to the Fight for Our Future coalition for bringing us all together today.It is great to see so many of you—especially so many young people, our next generation of leaders—out here in this fight.Labor issues and climate issues are two sides of the same coin. And I believe that the solution to the climate crisis runs right through the labor movement.Unions have boots on the ground in every community, in every corner of the country. And we are already on the front lines of the climate crisis.When there’s a hurricane or a flood or a wildfire, it’s our members who are on the ground fixing power lines and rebuilding damaged infrastructure. We see the impacts of the climate crisis every day—how it affects not just our jobs, but our families and our communities.And as our weather gets more and more extreme—with colder winters and hotter summers—working people are paying the price.I’m from Oregon, and last summer there was a record heat wave out there. Farmworkers were out in the field working in temperatures as high as 104 degrees.One man, Sebastian Francisco Perez, was working on a farm trying to save money to have a baby and start a family. He was moving irrigation lines in the field in that heat for hours. When his coworkers realized they hadn’t seen him in a long time, they started searching and found him unresponsive.He died on the job from heat exposure. He was just 38 years old.If we don’t address our climate crisis, there will be more stories like his. We can’t accept that.There’s no question that the labor movement feels the urgency of addressing the climate crisis every day.We know we have to do more than just react and rebuild. We have to get ahead of this crisis by creating the next generation of solutions and clean energy.The bipartisan infrastructure law is a good start. It’s helping us build a national electric vehicle charging network, make buildings more efficient, replace lead pipes to clean up our water, and so much more.But we have to keep going. This problem is too big to stop there.So let’s call on Congress to pass the Building a Better America Agenda and make historic investments in a clean energy future that’s made in America.Everything from solar panels to offshore wind turbines should be built in American factories. And those jobs—the ones that your generation will be doing—should be good union jobs.These should be careers, not gig contracts. They should be safe. With good pay.Let’s build a future where labor and environmental standards go hand-in-hand.Let’s hold companies’ feet to the fire.Let’s make jobs in solar and wind, electric vehicles and greener public transit, and the next generation of technology good union jobs from day one.Together, our movements can make that happen.And we can work to make those opportunities available to people in every community—especially those most harmed by the climate crisis. The communities of color who have long borne the brunt of pollution and climate change should be at the center of our solutions to this crisis.Because we can’t move forward if some of us are still left behind.So let’s raise our voices—work together—and fight for the change we need.Let’s call on our lawmakers to help us build that future.And let’s build a better country and a better planet—together.Thank you. © 2023 AFL-CIO.

16,From the Great Resignation to the Great Resurgence,https://aflcio.org/speeches/great-resignation-great-resurgence,4-20-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks at a polling briefing at the AFL-CIO Headquarters on April 20th.Good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank everyone here in DC and those of you tuning in across the country for joining us - we’ve got a great program for you today and some incredible new insights into the mindsets of working people to share. Over the past few months, we’ve heard a lot of talk about the Great Resignation - and rightfully so. Last year, nearly 48 million workers quit their jobs – a record high number. A number that high clearly means something bigger is at play – 48 million people don’t leave their jobs and search for new ones for no reason.We all know the reasons. We’ve talked to friends who couldn’t wait to leave an unsafe, under-staffed workplace, and moms who were tired of working two jobs on top of homeschooling. We know people who were sick of having hours that were so unpredictable that they could never make plans, and others who were told their options were to work with COVID or be sent home without pay. But to truly do working people justice, we need to go beyond just the anecdotal evidence … and we need to look beyond the pandemic and recognize this was a problem years in the making.To do that, we worked with Avalanche Insights … and I know that Wasay Rasool from Avalanche is here, who worked on this research with us, thank you Wasay Rasool. Together, we talked to more than 10 thousand people about the state of work – and we heard them loud and clear. And we are going to walk you through the findings from our research today. But you’re also going to hear directly from three people about how the past few years have changed their jobs and the way they think about work:We’ll hear from them and dive into the numbers in a minute, but the bottom line is that people are fed up with working bad jobs for even worse pay hearing they are essential one minute and expendable the next. Just one top line I’ll preview from the research is that we found that nearly half of the workforce has negative feelings about work. One of the most surprising things we discovered was that while many people did quit their jobs over issues with income and pay, more respondents said that the way they were treated at work was what pushed them to leave their jobs. Time and time again, we heard workers say unfair treatment, poor management, and toxic environments were the worst part of their job. That makes sense. If your job is miserable, if your workplace is miserable, if your boss is miserable … then you’re probably going to be miserable, too. So we know people left because of bad conditions, but we wanted to know more than that - we wanted to know what could have fixed it and made them stay. Not surprising, better salary and benefits were top of mind, but again we saw that better treatment, better hours and better management would have made the difference. And coming from our perch here at the AFL-CIO, we know that unions are the best way to get all of those things … but we wanted to know if workers also thought collective action could have solved the issues at their workplace. And half of the respondents said yes.  It’s not a coincidence that working conditions have hit rock bottom after two years of workers being isolated and separated from one another – by COVID, but also by design as technology takes hold. And it’s not a surprise that people see the solution to these problems starts with joining together and tackling these issues collectively. Working people see that speaking with a collective voice is more powerful. Those who felt collective action could help their workplace issues said they thought it could specifically improve working conditions, communication, and accountability. They’re right - that is exactly what unions advocate for. And we’re seeing the power of that advocacy as working people all over the country join together and win uphill battles against corporate giants like Starbucks and Amazon. That’s why, when I look at the Great Resignation, I see something else - something we’re calling The Great Resurgence. This a rebirth of worker power and a moment unlike any other in the history of the labor movement. As you’ll hear in greater detail  – people are rethinking their relationship to work and reevaluating what it is they want from their employers. People have never done more work and gotten less in return – less money, less respect, less predictability. And they know that the only way to turn bad jobs into good jobs and to reset the balance of power is by coming together. The tides are turning, momentum is building and the doors to the labor movement are wide open. With that, I’ll turn it over to Michelle Penson, our Director of Data and Technology who will walk us through our research. And while these numbers are so compelling, they are also more than just numbers. Each data point represents someone who is trying to work hard to make a living and finding it more and more difficult every day. Today, we get to bring these numbers to life with three people who have seen the working world change dramatically over the last two years, felt those changing power dynamics, and taken action to right the course. First, is Donyale Whitaker, who has worked in the hospitality industry for more than 12 years. She is currently on leave from her job as a guest room attendant at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center and is working as a staff member of UNITE HERE Local 25, the union of hotel, restaurant and casino workers in the D.C. metro region. And right now, she is helping the union’s campaign to organize hotel workers across the DC region. Also joining us today is Aaron True, a Senior Outreach Associate at the non-profit Alliance for Justice. Aaron is also a union co-chair for the Alliance for Justice Union, affiliated with Washington-Baltimore News Guild, TNG-CWA Local 32035. He played a key role during contract negotiations to secure the union’s first collective bargaining agreement, which was signed just two months ago – congratulations, Aaron. Their new contract includes several key workplace improvements he can tell us more about. And last but certainly not least, we have Clare Berke  who has been a teacher at Benjamin Banneker High School, a part of DC’s Public School System, for more than 13 years. She is also a Building Chair for the Washington Teachers Union, advocating for our heroic teachers who have done so much during the pandemic and for the students who rely on them. Aaron, Donyell and Clare, thank you so much for all you do and for joining us here today. I’m so grateful for the opportunity to hear from you all about your experiences navigating our changing workplaces, and about your thoughts on the Great Resurgence of worker organizing. © 2023 AFL-CIO.

17,Redmond: We Need a New Global Social Contract with Workers at the Center,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-we-need-new-global-social-contract-workers-center,4-19-2022,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond's opening remarks as prepared for the Trade Union Confederation of the Americas Executive Committee Meeting:Hello, everyone. It’s my pleasure to welcome all of you to this TUCA seminar and to be sharing the stage with incredible partners like:I know that with all of the great leaders we have joining together this week that this is going to be a productive gathering and a time of unity for our community. And I know you all join me in extending those thoughts of unity to our siblings in Ukraine, who we are thinking of and stand ready to support. And speaking of joining together, I have to say, it is so nice to be with all of you in person after so many virtual meetings. 

And it is especially great to be here in Panama – home to one of the greatest symbols of global connection, the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal is where ingenuity and the incredible, heroic efforts of working people met the needs of a changing world. Through innovation, engineering and sheer force of will, working people were able to connect countries, markets and communities across the globe. But those efforts were not without fault or risk. Workers – large numbers of whom were African-American and Black workers from many countries whose unions are now members of TUCA – faced incredibly dangerous and exploitative conditions day in and day out.The construction of the Panama Canal took the lives of thousands of workers, the majority of whom were black. 

They were killed by mudslides, falling boulders, and unsafe working conditions that led to preventable dynamite explosions. 

And they were also killed by outbreaks of viruses like yellow fever that swept through worksites.

While many of those dangers were left unaddressed, the spread of the virus did lead to the rollout of a massive public health campaign to improve working and living conditions for the workers clearing the canal. And it was incredibly effective – draining standing water and putting screens on the windows helped curb the spread of the mosquito-borne disease. Putting worker health and safety first worked – just as it always has. Given that backdrop, and the reality that too many workers – especially workers of color – still face too many of these same types of challenges today, I can’t think of a more fitting place for us to have this conversation about how, as a global community, we build back from COVID – the virus that has swept through our own worksites and communities over the past two years … and about how we build a future that addresses inequality, ends worker exploitation and keeps working people across the Americas safer. We know working people are – and always will be – on the front lines of our greatest challenges, as we have been during COVID. 

Our health care workers risked exposure to keep others alive. 

Our teachers made sure the next generation continued to have access to education. 

And our government and public employees organized and delivered relief and recovery plans. We also know that some workers face greater risk than others – people of color who live in communities that have been subject to underinvestment and neglect for decades … those in the informal economy … those on the margins. We need to bring them to the center of our thinking everywhere we go, because we cannot move forward as a global community if we leave people behind. COVID served as a clear reminder that we are a global community. We have to think globally and act globally. The impact of the decisions we make does not stop at our borders. And our solidarity cannot stop at our borders either. I know this seminar, and TUCA meetings after it, will give all of us a chance to ask the big questions. 

What are the lessons we’ve learned from this pandemic? 

How can we work together to plan ahead for the next challenge we will face as a global community? 

How do we help those who are most impacted? I believe the answers to those questions start with the creation of a New Global Social Contract that puts workers and sustainability at the center of everything. This is our moment to rebuild our global economy with better standards and to reset the balance of power so that those who do the work receive a fair share of the wealth we help create.And this work is urgent. Because the current global economic model is unsustainable. It has enabled the worst-ever global health emergency… increased racial and gender inequity… and accelerated the disastrous effects of climate change. And it continues to feed runaway economic inequality through the systemic discrimination and devaluation of human beings.Working people bear the brunt of all of these challenges. But this idea of a New Global Social Contract tells us that we can – and must – be at the center of the plans to address them. In the U.S, the Biden-Harris Administration is aggressively embracing this framework. They are putting workers and sustainability at the center of both domestic and global policy priorities. Right now, we are making a once-in-a-generation infrastructure investment that will create good-paying union jobs and grow the economy sustainably and equitably. This is all possible. Rights, equity, a universal social protection floor, a just transition, and solidarity. Nations and people working together. That’s how we will solve the great problems facing workers everywhere. A New Global Social Contract should be a baseline understanding among the world’s governments, global corporations, multilateral institutions, communities of faith, trade unions and civil society organizations. We all have a role to play in making a better, fairer, more just, more connected world. And as they learned a century ago at the Panama Canal … and as we have learned from COVID over the past two years … to build that world, we must put worker health and safety front and center. Our global advancement cannot come at the cost of working people’s lives. That’s why the ILO’s work to recognize Occupational Health and Safety as a core convention is so important. This is a fundamental right. No one should be forced to work in conditions that put their life or health at risk. Creating safe workplaces also means protecting every person from gender-based harassment and violence.That’s why I am so proud that the Solidarity Center will be adding additional support to the work of TUCA’s Women’s Committee to ratify and implement ILO Convention c190 in the Americas. These are important steps forward, but they are just the beginning. Workers everywhere are asking for better working conditions, better pay and better standards. They are fed up and fired up - and we as a movement must stand ready to help them take action. Unions are the best vehicle to deliver the change workers want for our families and for our communities. So as workers recognize the power of joining together - let’s be ready to reach out our hands. In America, most workers want a union. In fact, 60 million American workers would join a union today if they could. People are joining together in places and industries we could never have imagined. Union organizing from Starbucks to Amazon should remind us all that demanding a collective voice in our workplaces is possible, even in the face of tremendous obstacles.I hope the collective spirit of workers around the world guides all of us through this meeting and through our work moving forward. I have no doubt that we can build a movement that meets the moment and a better future for working people everywhere. Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

18,Redmond: Unions Are Pathways to Better Futures,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-unions-are-pathways-better-futures,4-9-2022,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks as prepared to the New York State Association of Black, Puerto Rican and Asian Legislators Conference:Thank you, Anthony [Harmon], my brother and friend, for that very kind introduction. Anthony and I have had the privilege of working together on a number of issues and his work is always fantastic, whether it’s supporting educators or advancing social justice in the labor movement and beyond.And the same goes for today’s honorees, Sister [Nancy] Hagans and Sister [Janella] Hinds and Brother [Donald] Nesbitt, I’m glad you’re getting this recognition. You deserve it. Congratulations.I also want to recognize [New York State] Senator Jessica Ramos for her grit and tenacity. You’re a tremendous advocate for New York’s working people.And Charlene Gayle, thank you for your leadership in putting this conference together and bringing us all together at a crucial time in our nation’s history. It’s so important to have leaders that look like our communities and who can share their perspectives and experiences to make sure all voices are heard and represented.[Pause]As Anthony said, I’m Fred Redmond, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO. We're a federation of 57 unions representing more than 12.5 million working people in all sectors of the economy.And working people in every sector of the economy have been through a lot the past couple of years.The pandemic and the 2020 elections. The attacks on our democracy. The attacks on our right to vote and our right to organize. And now we are all on edge from Putin’s attack on Ukraine and our hearts go out to the people there.In the labor movement, our solidarity doesn’t stop at the borders.Our Solidarity Center has an office over there and they’re on the ground supporting Ukrainian union members and their families.We have been working closely with the International Trade Union Confederation to coordinate our response and provide needed relief.And Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, was in Poland this week. She met with teachers and students who had to flee their homes, as well as with Polish labor leaders and humanitarian groups. Like all of us, she is working on finding more ways we can help. In the labor movement we know that moments of great challenge can - and often do - become moments of unity and moments of opportunity. After the challenges we’ve faced here at home over the last few years, – working people across the country are fed up and they are recognizing their power. They are coming together and standing up for their rights at the ballot box and on the job. They are standing together for better pay and benefits and safer jobs. We know our power. We know we are essential - to our  employers, our communities, and our economy. We showed up throughout the pandemic and kept our country running.We showed up for each other and our communities when they needed us most… And now we have the momentum and we have a chance to come back stronger than ever before.Working people are looking to unions as a pathway to a better future.In newsrooms, museums, nonprofits, retail and clean energy – workers are joining together in existing and emerging sectors.Just look at what’s been happening here in New York:Workers in Manhattan formed the first ever union at REI.Tech workers at the New York Times just formed the largest tech worker union in the country. Workers at Starbucks in Buffalo organized and kicked off a domino effect that is sweeping coffee shops nationwide – including the new union at the Manhattan Flagship.In Niagara Falls, Cascades ContainerBoard workers organized with the Machinists after a three year effort.And just last week, workers on Staten Island formed the first ever union at Amazon. At Amazon.Even as Amazon continues to break the law, workers continue to defy the odds. Chris Smalls is a big reason why and I’m thrilled he is being recognized today for his efforts. His persistence and passion is changing the narrative.We can see the power shifting. Everybody knows it. Even the President.As President Biden said at our building trades conference in Washington the other day – “Amazon, here we come.”President Biden recognizes the power of working people and he knows that the choice to join a union belongs to workers and workers alone. This is why we worked so hard and campaigned and mobilized and got out the vote in 2020: For a democratic majority in Congress and the most pro-union administration in our country’s history.And that work that all of us put in is why we are now making  the investments workers have been demanding for so long.The American Rescue Plan… it was a critical lifeline we needed. It put money in people’s pockets and kept our economy from skidding off the rails.And the bipartisan infrastructure bill…Hundreds of thousands of jobs… good, life-changing union jobs… in New York and across the country.This bill strengthens our supply chains… and Buy America rules to help stop the outsourcing of good union jobs.It connects prevailing wages and high labor standards to the jobs created, and we are going to make sure those commitments are honored.But our work isn’t done. We’re still pushing for more in President Biden’s Building a Better America plan. At the top of the list is a key piece of the PRO Act that will make sure union-busting employers who violate our right to organize will be hit with real penalties…That list also includes making major investments in energy and manufacturing supply chains… with stronger Buy American provisions…It includes making prescription drugs more affordable. Investing in education… and in child care and elder care so more working families can get back to work.That is the agenda people voted for. And the labor movement is committed to making sure our union members know who can deliver it – and who has already delivered for them as we head into the 2022 elections.We’re going to connect the dots. We’re going to remind them that elections have consequences. Remind them who delivered for working people and our economy at all levels of the government… who showed up and pushed for and passed legislation that will help working families and shrink the inequality gap.There’s a lot of good recent examples we’re going to lift up here in New York:Safe staffing levels at every hospital and nursing home so patients get the care they need and deserve.Collective bargaining rights for immigrants and undocumented workers because a union job is a safer job, and now the farmworkers at Pindar Vineyards can address their concerns without fear or retaliation.Equity and high labor standards for cannabis workers because jobs in ALL industries should be good jobs. And high-road, high-quality jobs to develop New York’s offshore wind and strengthen our supply chain and offshore grid. Good jobs up and down the East Coast.All of these advances were made possible by labor and legislators… including many of you here today…When New York’s working people are at the table and have a voice at all levels of the government, it shows.If we keep lifting up those voices and working together, we can build a better future for our children and grandchildren.We can raise labor standards across industries.We can guarantee our taxpayer dollars are used for equitable and diverse workforce training programs.We can create an economy that is responsive to the needs of working families. Now look, I said that we’re going to talk to our members about the good work you’re doing for working people. I need you to do the same. Talk to your colleagues across the country. Share your successes. Tell them how putting workers first is good for us all and for democracy. Tell them that when we stand together there is nothing we can’t do. Thank you.

19,Shuler to NABTU: Let's Build a Movement to Meet the Moment,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-nabtu-lets-build-movement-meet-moment,4-5-2022,"Thank you, Sean (McGarvey), for the kind words, and most importantly, for your friendship. You’re a true brother—and the vision and focus you’ve brought to the building trades agenda is incredible—you and secretary-treasurer Brent Booker are a phenomenal team and I’m so grateful for your partnership and vision. Thank you to the general board of presidents, and state and local leaders who have made the building trades a powerhouse all across North America.It’s such an honor to be with you, this conference has been a huge part of my life—I can’t believe I can say I’ve been attending since 1999 (there’s a Prince song in there somewhere...). That’s over 20 years! And to share the stage with such a fierce lineup of trailblazing women leaders? Senator Murkowski, the first woman senator from Alaska. Secretary Raimondo, the first woman governor of Rhode Island. And of course Speaker Pelosi, the first and only woman Speaker of the House. Talk about inspiration.It’s been quite a morning. Anybody else in here have a late night watching the national championship last night? If you’re from Kansas you’re still celebrating. What a game!We have a lot of other victories to celebrate too—the victories we’ve won for working people.We elected one of the most pro-union administrations in history. And they are delivering results.We have a building tradesman as our Secretary of Labor! Marty Walsh, is the first union leader to run the department in more than four decades. That’s already making a difference for our members every day.The American Rescue Plan was huge—and so much of that is thanks to your leadership. We organized and mobilized for decades to get relief for our multiemployer pension plans (Sean McGarvey, take a bow because you led us!). Now we can truly say, promises made will be promises kept.And speaking of promises kept, it was this administration that finally delivered on infrastructure. Other presidents talked about rebuilding America. President Joe Biden got it done.The bipartisan infrastructure law is helping us create millions of good union jobs to fix roads and bridges; improve our ports and airports and water infrastructure; install and maintain energy-efficient building tech; and build a national electric vehicle charging network and so much more.Now it’s up to us to shape this investment for the generations to come, to take advantage of the strong labor standards we got attached to this infrastructure spending—seek out those innovative partnerships with grant recipients—be the enforcers to make sure that the money lands the way it’s supposed to.And it’s up to us to train the workforce and supply a steady stream of workers for these jobs. Especially women, people of color, veterans and the formerly incarcerated—folks who may not realize the power of a union apprenticeship. It’s our time to shine, and be laser-focused in recruiting and expanding access to underrepresented communities, and create on-ramps to careers for people that will last a lifetime.And we know how to do that, don’t we? No one is better at training people than us. So let’s make that training pipeline reflective of the communities where the jobs are being created—and make good on President Biden’s promise to deliver at least 40 percent of the overall benefits from federal investments in clean energy to disadvantaged communities.We have unlimited potential to recruit and train a diverse workforce and to work with our employer partners to expand our footprint into parts of the country that don’t have a lot of union density. And to train an emerging workforce for the jobs of tomorrow.Sean and Brent talk about it all the time—the building trades apprenticeship programs are the gold standard. But more people need to know about it—It shouldn’t be our best kept secret. Earn while you learn—and afterwards, there’s a good job waiting for you—a career filled with dignity and opportunity and advancement. We’ve seen how it changes lives. A single mom, who was sleeping in her car, not knowing where she was going to find the next meal for her son, who found hope in her union and now is building wind turbines and powering America. This is powerful stuff.The infrastructure jobs we’re planning for are going to be good jobs in our own backyards. The Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan is a good example—it will not only give everyone access to clean water in their communities, but will grow good jobs locally. Build value for—and trust with—our partner employers. The investments in the clean energy economy, like offshore wind. And expanding on the top-down partnerships we are building with companies like Orsted, who see the value of working with the most highly skilled and trained professionals in the industry. Thank you Brent for your incredible work on that MOU and PLA—we have a chance to not only build sustainable infrastructure, but a sustainable future with good union jobs at the center.But to get there, we have to meet this modernization of our country with modernization of our own.We have to change, adapt and shift with the times. We need to build unions with members and leaders who look like our communities and share our values.And we are. We are building a modern, dynamic and inclusive movement to meet the moment.We are building a movement that leverages our power to bring women and people of color from the margins to the center—at work, in our unions and in our economy.I know what it’s like to be the only woman in the room. I got my start in the labor movement coming up through IBEW Local 125 out of Portland, Oregon, nearly 30 years ago.There are more women in the building trades now than there were decades ago, but we still have a lot of work to do in order to better recruit, retain and protect our union sisters.And that needs to be a priority because by 2025 (three years), women will be half the labor movement.We have 6.5 million women members in our unions. In fact, WE—the labor movement—are the largest working women’s organization in the country.And I want every single one of those women, in every type of job, to see they have a place in our movement. And that—if they want—that place can be at the head of the table.And I’m so proud to see the building trades building and experimenting with different programs and structures to move the needle: pre-apprenticeship programs to give women the knowledge and skills they need to succeed from the first day they put on a hard hat; women’s committees and tradeswomen organizations—like NABTU’s Lean In Circles—that help foster that support network which we know is so important.Our movement has to be constantly adapting and changing along with our members. Because work is constantly evolving and changing. Jobs are being redefined every day—just look at how the “gig” economy has reshaped work in the course of a few years. And it’s not just rideshare and delivery now. We’re seeing the Uberization of Nursing being proposed in California. The gig economy likes to think it’s unique—that they’re technology-driven platforms, not employers, so they don’t have to pay decent wages or provide health care or worker’s comp. But we know there’s a better way—that you can be flexible and have a dynamic workforce AND take care of the people doing the work. It’s called the building trades model—WE are the original gig employer and we know it doesn’t have to be a race to the bottom.We want to show the world as we build toward the future, that our movement is adapting to meet the moment. And this is an incredibly pivotal moment, where so many things feel so high stakes—Ukraine—the Supreme Court—Truth Social—even March Madness seemed more dramatic than usual.We started by talking about the victory at the Superdome in New Orleans, but the victory I can’t stop thinking about is the one at JFK8 on Staten Island.On Friday, workers formed the first ever union at Amazon. And the Amazon Labor Union is making waves across the country. Of course, this victory was inspired by the heroic, trailblazing workers in Bessemer, Alabama, who are now within striking distance of forming their own union with RWDSU-UFCW, after the second election at that plant.It’s incredible. Amazon continues to break the law. And workers continue to defy the odds. In the face of one of the richest, most anti-union corporations, workers triumphed. They reminded us how important it is to try new things and to learn from each other.Workers across the country are reevaluating what they need from their employers. And we need to stand ready with every tool we have to help them reimagine the future.Victory at Amazon proves that when working people unite in the fight for justice, anything is possible. This is an incredible moment for union activism, and it is clear this is just the beginning.We’re not going to let outdated labor laws stand in our way of organizing and growing our power. We’re going to keep fighting for the PRO Act and for a better, brighter vision for working people. And we’re going to keep fighting for paid leave and accessible child care.We are going to keep fighting and organizing, and growing because that is how we build the future we all want—a future where every working person has a good, union job, in every community. And where every worker has the training and support they need to get those jobs and keep them.Our members and the American people are fed up and fired up. Let’s show them that the labor movement has their back.Let’s keep our foot on the gas.We have momentum—and the Building Trades are leading the way.Let’s build on it and build an economy that works for working people. Everyone included, no one left behind.I can’t wait to see where we go from here.Thank you. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
20,Shuler: AFGE Is United for Safer Workplaces,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-afge-united-safer-workplaces,4-4-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks by video for the AFGE Veterans Affairs Council Health and Safety Conference:

Hello everyone. I’m Liz Shuler, President of the AFL-CIO. I’m thrilled to be joining you—even if it is by video.I’d like to thank President [Everett] Kelley and Secretary-Treasurer [Eric] Bunn and Vice President [Tim] Snyder for their leadership of this vibrant union during these trying times. And to Alma [Lee] and the entire NVAC team for your deep commitment to the 120,000 employees who support America’s veterans in every possible way.And to everyone who put in the hard work to make this conference possible. Thank you. I like how this conference is joint labor-management. Because no matter if you’re from management, or the union, everyone has a vested interest in the health and safety of our veterans and making sure the patients and clients get the attention and care they deserve.Coming together like this shows our commitment to the common good, and that we’re united and laser-focused in making life better for working people.Because we have to be. We’ve been through a lot… economic and environmental disasters… racial trauma and violence… and a pandemic that has killed nearly one million Americans and is still a huge presence in our lives.And workers… especially our health care workers… have been carrying America through these challenging times…Healing the sick… caring for the elderly and our veterans… and keeping all of us healthy.And have been doing it against all odds.Thinking back to those early stages of the pandemic when health care workers didn’t have the most basic PPE… showing up to work in garbage bags and wearing homemade masks and face shields – it’s hard to believe.The lives of working people have been on the line.We’ve been thanked. We’ve been deemed essential. We’ve been called heroes. But what we want is a safe job!Every working person has the right to come home alive at the end of our shift and free from injury and illness. This is a fundamental right and a core union value.But so many workers continue to be placed in harm’s way because employers refuse to follow the rules and keep us safe.And it’s not just COVID.Violence in the workplace has reached epidemic levels, especially for health care and social service workers.You all know the numbers. Nurses and medical assistants… social workers and emergency responders suffer more than 70 percent of all workplace assaults. And women are at particular risk… suffering two out of every three serious workplace violence injuries.And short staffing only exacerbates the risk of being seriously injured on the job, and the ability to care for patients.And it is only getting worse.Nurses are leaving their profession at alarming rates… a profession they love. Because their workplaces are not safe and they’re burnt out. Six out of 10 frontline healthcare workers say the pandemic has had a negative effect on their mental health.They’re tired of working the long and taxing shifts… Tired of not getting the resources they need to give the care their patients deserve.And as a result, patients suffer. Because a poorly staffed and anxious and exhausted workforce leads to poor health outcomes for patients.The Biden administration has made great strides to slow the spread of Covid, and has put measures in place to protect workers.But the emergency OSHA protections that healthcare workers had from Covid have been stripped away and now we, the labor movement, are fighting to make those permanent. Just last week, OSHA announced they are taking public comment on a permanent standard to protect health care workers from Covid. Unions made that happen. This pandemic is far from over and we have to keep fighting for stronger worker protections from COVID-19 exposures and all infectious diseases.And we have to keep fighting for stronger protections from workplace violence. We’ve seen in a number of states, including California and New York, they’ve adopted workplace violence prevention standards or laws, but there aren’t enough states doing this… so we are pushing the Congress to pass a federal standard. These are common sense standards that would require health care and social service employers to protect their workers from what are often foreseeable and preventable injuries. It’s the employer’s responsibility to provide workers a safe workplace, and we know unions are the best way to safer jobs… by giving workers a voice at the table on safety, and on scheduling and staffing levels so patients get the attention and care they deserve. And that includes our veterans. They deserve the best care possible. But they aren’t receiving it because VA nurses, doctors and other medical professionals… many of whom are veterans themselves… aren’t allowed to collectively bargain for the resources they need… and the pay and benefits they have earned.Congressman Mark Takano of California and Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio have a bill that would fix this… the V-A Employee Fairness Act… and we’re pushing to get that to a vote too.   The labor movement grew out of the fight for safer working conditions… and that fight continues today. We are on the picket lines… we are organizing in our workplaces and we are organizing for stronger laws and protections… we are organizing for safe jobs!Workers Memorial Day is coming up on April 28th, where every year…  we remember the workers who needlessly have been killed, injured or made ill because of their jobs, and we recommit ourselves in the fight for safe jobs.  A day where we… as Mother Jones said… “mourn for the dead and fight like hell for the living.”On April 28th and every day.Let’s show all working people the power of coming together in their unions and in partnership with allies and employers – that when we’re united for a safer workplace… for better wages and conditions on the job...that means a better future for everyone.
 
Have a great conference and I can’t wait to see where we go from here.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
21,Shuler to IBEW: Unions Improve Workplace Culture,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-ibew-unions-improve-workplace-culture,4-4-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the IBEW Construction and Maintenance Conference:Thank you Mike [Richard] for that kind introduction. And thank you so much for having me here.David [Long], you and NECA have been an incredible and valued partner for our union and our members in so many ways.Lonnie [Stephenson]—my brother and good friend—thank you for your incredible leadership. You and Kenny [Cooper] make a truly dynamic team and the cutting edge work you’ve done to grow the IBEW is truly an example for the entire labor movement.And to the International Vice Presidents and International Executive Council members—thank you for your commitment, your passion and for your leadership.I love being back here with the IBEW. Many of you know I got my start in the labor movement coming up through IBEW Local 125 out of Portland, Oregon.My whole family worked at our local power company Portland General Electric, and it was there I saw the difference a union could make. Because the women working in the clerical jobs weren’t in the union, and the power linemen were.I saw the difference first hand—that working a union job meant you got treated better—with a measure of respect.I know all of you know that difference too. And America is finally seeing unions in a different way—as a vehicle for better pay and benefits AND as a way to make change they’re hungry for.Have you seen the polling? Public support for unions is off the charts, especially among young people.Because people want better pay and benefits. But it’s also about dignity—and respect—and having a voice to shape what happens in the workplace.Every month we see new numbers about workers leaving their jobs. “The Great Resignation.” Last month was the record— 4.4 million workers quit in February alone.They’re fed up. They’re exhausted and frustrated and for many of them, the pandemic was the tipping point. They’re tired of risking their health and safety for a terrible job with low pay. They’re tired of being told they’re “essential” one minute and then treated as disposable the next.But low pay is only part of the equation. We just did a survey of some 20,000 workers who left their job in the past two years. We wanted to know why. Not surprising, workers who quit their jobs have a lot of negative feelings about work—but what WAS surprising was that workplace culture was a driver more than pay. Unfair treatment, burnout, toxic environments and bad management were the top reasons why they left.Workplace culture is a huge driver for everyone. Even for union members. But if you’re in a union, you have a way to fix it. I hear a lot about scheduling. Being able to plan your life and have a predictable schedule is huge. But we rarely talk about that when we’re out organizing and should be something we lead with as we reach out to the emerging workforce.These workplace culture issues are also critical as we try to recruit and retain more women in construction.The Institute for Women's Policy Research surveyed tradeswomen about their careers in the construction industry. Four out of 10 respondents said they considered leaving the construction industry. And do you know what were the most cited reasons? Discrimination. Lack of respect. An unsupportive and toxic work environment.Of course we want to say that those toxic environments were all non-union job sites—but we know we have more work to do to make our workplaces more welcoming and inclusive. And this isn’t just limited to the construction industry. We have to do better across the board, and even in our labor movement. We should be leaders in what makes the best workplaces!I say this because women are half the workforce, and are projected to be half of the union members in the United States.And we want them to see the labor movement as a movement for them.That’s what makes the IBEW Strong initiative so incredible—it’s that support structure with diversity, equity and inclusion at the heart of it. And that’s so critically important. Women’s committees, tradeswomen’s organizations, pre-apprenticeship programs for women—that support system, care and training infrastructure are absolutely critical to ensure their success.That’s another thing we learned from that IWPR survey. Nearly 90% said support from their union was an important factor for success.Everyone in this room had a mentor or tool buddy who helped them get to where they are. Don’t pull that ladder up behind you—be intentional when you go home. Commit to reaching out and being that mentor, that guide.Because that’s the kind of solidarity that’s built to last—and we need it now more than ever.Because there are forces chipping away at democracies all over the world—or outright attacking it. Look at what’s going on in Ukraine and the needless devastation and suffering and hardship happening to the people there.And we cannot think for a second that it can’t happen here.Our right to vote has been attacked. Our right to organize without fear and intimidation has been attacked too.And the people and forces that want to silence our voices in the workplace and at the ballot box, are the same ones who want to destabilize our democracy.Democracy gives us freedom. And we have to work hard to protect it. Some would say we’re at a tipping point. We can’t take anything for granted.We have the most pro-union administration in our lifetime in office right now with a pro-worker Congress and they’ve delivered bigtime for working people.The American Rescue Plan—the bipartisan infrastructure bill—these were huge victories! And millions of good union jobs will be created fixing roads and bridges, improving our ports and airports and water infrastructure, installing broadband and replacing lead pipes and service lines. Rehabilitating and retrofitting affordable, resilient housing.Five billion dollars in funding for a national electric vehicle charging network!And investments in training programs that will expand access to underrepresented communities, and create onramps to careers for people that will last a lifetime. The training pipeline needs to be reflective of the communities where the jobs are being created and we need to make good on President Biden’s promise to deliver at least 40 percent of the overall benefits from Federal investments in clean energy to disadvantaged communities.And what about the installation and maintenance of energy-efficient building tech. The clean energy economy and the greening of our building stock is an exciting growth area that benefits us all.There’s so much good stuff in these bills.And on top of that, President Biden signed an executive order requiring project labor agreements on federal construction projects above $35 million. Which means greater safety for our highly-skilled and highly-trained workforce—value for our taxpayers—and quality construction that will last for generations.These are the investments working people have been wanting and waiting for and if we can’t tie these wins back to the pro-worker elected officials who made it possible, then we’re doing it wrong.We absolutely have to because here we are again, already—the 2022 elections are upon us and America seems to be more polarized than ever.We know how our politics relates to organizing and bargaining wins, and transformative legislation. We know how election outcomes can radically change our future. Now it is on us to explain to our members how our political activism directly relates to more and better work opportunities for the IBEW and our communities.We need to connect the dots. And we have been building out the framework for our political plan nationally, and we know we have to approach it differently this time. Thanks to Lonnie, who Vice chairs the AFL-CIO executive council political committee. We’ve been working closely together on a new approach—more unified than ever.One thing we know is we’re going to need to do some deep listening and get back to basics. Reestablish credibility through face to face conversations, especially in the worksites.Those conversations will surface the issues that really matter to our members and then we can connect those issues to the candidates when it’s time to get out the vote.And we’re not done. We are still pushing Congress to Build a Better America and deliver more for working families.Together we can advance legislation that will create even more jobs and investment in the clean energy sector.We can bring millions of workers out of the shadows and provide a broad path to citizenship.We can address our health care and education needs, and bolster the care economy because the child care system in our country is badly broken and HAS to be fixed.This isn’t just a women’s issue. This is a family issue. This is a working person's issue. This is a core economic issue. The pandemic made that clear. Care work makes all other jobs possible. That’s the bottom line.And care jobs should be good jobs with livable wages, benefits and protections, which means we need to strengthen labor law enforcement by getting a key piece of the PRO Act passed so employers who violate our right to organize are met with REAL consequences for breaking the law.But we’re not going to let outdated labor laws stand in our way to grow our power. The labor movement adapts and adjusts to the new reality. IBEW kept organizing workers throughout the pandemic—found new ways to reach workers using technology—and combined that with deep listening. It’s a winning formula we can build upon across the labor movement—we have to.Because if we aren’t waking up everyday thinking about organizing, especially in this moment where working people are speaking out, standing up and demanding change like never before—then shame on us.Because this is our moment—to organize. To grow. To change people’s lives.To reimagine an economy that works for working people. Everyone included, no one left behind.We’re building a modern, dynamic and inclusive labor movement and IBEW is leading the way.Let’s keep rolling. We have the momentum.Let’s be bold and not be afraid to try new things.And grow IBEW power in the workplace and in our communities.I can’t wait to see where we go from here.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

22,Redmond: We're Building a Pennsylvania That Works for All of Us,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-were-building-pennsylvania-works-all-us,4-2-2022,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond's remarks as prepared to the Beaver County (Penn.) Democratic Party:Thank you, Director Bernie [Hall], my brother and friend. Bernie just recently was sworn in as our new Director in PA. We are so proud of him and excited about his leadership of our Union, here in the Commonwealth of PA.Terri [Mitko] - thank you for inviting me to join you all tonight. I’m thrilled to be here.Thanks to all of our friends from the Democratic Party. The true voice of working families: Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman; Rich Fitzgerald, Allegheny County Executive; State Representatives Austin Davis, Brian Sims, Rob Matzie; Beaver Falls Mayor Kenya Johns. Joe Spanik is here and is one of the first politicians I met and worked with when I came to PA. Chairwoman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party Nancy Patton Mills and all of you who fight the good fight on behalf of working families.And the same goes for all of the labor leaders in attendance. In particular I would like to recognize Rick Galliano of the Beaver-Lawrence CLC.     And the newly elected President of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO… my brother Frank Snyder. Your grit and determination has made the labor movement stronger… in this great commonwealth of ours and across the country.  And I am looking forward to working with you and Angela [Ferritto] and seeing your vision and leadership continue the progress of the labor movement here in the commonwealth.And I know you had a good mentor in Rick Bloomingdale. Pennsylvania’s working families have had no better advocate than Rick. And our democracy has had no better champion. And I wish him a happy and healthy retirement.[Pause]As you all know, in August of last year, our labor movement suffered a huge loss with the untimely death of Rich Trumka. Rich and I were personal friends for over 25 years. And I know he was a personal friend to many of you too.Rich was Pennsylvania to the core. He was born here. Raised here. Worked the mines here. And earned his degrees here. He loved this commonwealth. He loved this labor movement.He had faith in the future. And the Western P-A labor movement provided the greatest source of his optimism.And he had faith in Liz Shuler. Liz is smart, tough and the right person to lead the American labor movement at the right time.And I am honored to serve alongside her as the secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO.[Pause]Rich Trumka liked to say the labor movement must be at the front in the fight for our democracy. And he was right. There is no better institution in America to lead the charge.But we can’t do it alone. Together, organized labor and the democratic party can beat back the attacks on our democracy and take on the urgent issues facing our nation today.Economic justice.Racial and gender justice.Voting rights.And a path to citizenship for immigrants.All of these issues are critical to the health of our democracy… and to the lives of working people.We want to be able to exercise our rights AND be able to access the best opportunities for ourselves and our families.And we need our elected officials to have our backs.Right now, working people are fed up. The pandemic has pulled back the curtain. Workers are rejecting jobs where they risk their health and safety for a poverty wage. Workers are striking and standing up for their rights.And young people especially are embracing unions as a vehicle to speak up at work.There’s an energy out there and we’re working hard to capture it.By continuing to organize… building our capacity… and engaging with our communities.We’re showing ALL working people that the labor movement is for them… women, young people, people of color.Everybody is included. Our doors are wide open.And the AFL-CIO is all in! We have the momentum and we’re going to build on it and we’re gearing up to run the biggest, baddest political program yet.Because we are not listening to the pundits. They can say whatever they want about what’s going to happen this November. Because they don’t know the true power of organized labor and a strong democratic party working together.And we have to work together. There is too much at stake.We have a golden opportunity to have TWO pro-union senators represent Pennsylvania’s working families.We are going to send Attorney General Josh Shapiro to Harrisburg!Because Josh understands the working people of Pennsylvania and what we need.Try saying that about any of the nine candidates on the other side trying to out-Trump one another. You’ve heard their speeches. You’ve seen their ads. They don’t care about working people. Pick any one of those nine candidates out of a hat and you’ll get the same thing… Voter suppression. Right to work.Shapiro wants to make it easier to vote. Shapiro wants to make it easier for workers to organize. Do you know why? Because Shapiro believes in democracy!And you better believe Shapiro will veto any anti-democratic bill that gets to his desk.But he won’t have to. Because we are going to turn the Pennsylvania General Assembly blue!Now look, I have called Pennsylvania home for more than 20 years now. And one thing I have learned is that the Pennsylvania labor movement knows how to mobilize and engage its members.We saw it in 2020 during one of the most challenging times in our nation’s history.And we’re going to see it again this year. All eyes will be on Pennsylvania.And together – Pennsylvania democrats and the labor movement – we can be a force for change… for working people… for our communities.We are committed to electing pro-worker candidates up and down the ballot… and pass the legislation and policies that matter to working people.We know elections have consequences.If you need an example, look at the infrastructure bill President Biden signed into law. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs...good, life-changing union jobs…in Pennsylvania and across the country.And the labor movement was key… we talked to our members and elected officials. We talked to our members about the candidates who will be our best advocates.We campaigned and mobilized and got out the vote in 2020 so that we have a democratic majority in Congress and the most pro-union administration in our country’s history.That is how we have these investments workers have been demanding for so long.This bill strengthens our supply chains… and Buy America rules to help stop the outsourcing of good union jobs.It connects prevailing wages and high labor standards to the jobs created, and we are going to make sure those commitments are honored.Our work isn’t done. We’re still pushing for more in President Biden’s Building a Better America plan. At the top of the list is a key piece of the PRO Act so union-busting employers who violate our right to organize will be hit with real penalties…Major investments in energy and manufacturing supply chains… with stronger Buy American provisions…Affordable prescription drugs… investments in education… and in child care and elder care so more working families can get back to work. This is absolutely critical.We have an opportunity to build a better future for our children and our grandchildren.And we’re going to talk to every single union member and every single voter and help them see this better future. We’re going to connect the dots. We’re going to remind them that elections have consequences. Remind them who delivered for working people and our economy.And we’re going to send leaders with the compassion and courage that working people need and deserve toWashington and Harrisburg and to every county seat in this commonwealth.We’re going to remind them that when we stand together that there is nothing we can’t do.Let’s show them what we got. Let’s renew our historical bond – democrats and organized labor, together!Let’s renew our commitment to one another. Our democracy depends on it.Because this election isn’t just about Democrat versus Republican.It’s bigger than that. It’s more profound.It’s about workers and what’s fair versus greed and inequality…It’s about equity versus privilege... Honesty versus corruption…Order versus chaos…Good versus evil…It is about our very democracy!Let’s protect it!And let’s build a Pennsylvania that works for all of us!Let’s show everybody in this great commonwealth of ours…That when we stand together… Democrats. Labor. Unified with a common purpose… There is nothing – NOTHING! – we can’t do!Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Redmond
23,Shuler: Los Angeles County Labor Is at the Forefront,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-los-angeles-county-labor-forefront,3-31-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor's Worker Congress:Thank you Dominique [Di Prima] for that wonderful introduction. I’m so excited and honored to be included alongside all of these powerhouse women. The energy in this room is electric. And wasn’t that an amazing conversation between Lorena [Gonzalez] and Dr. [Angela] Davis?And I’d like to thank Ron [Herrera] and the LA Fed for bringing us all together and inviting me to join you today. Congratulations to you and all of the LA County Officers on your new term.It’s great to be in LA again. I was just here over the Super Bowl weekend in support of the NFLPA and to celebrate the organizing win at SoFi and the workers there. And to support the striking workers at Jon Donaire. And I saw many of you there too.It has been inspiring right? Working people joining together, having each other’s backs… through thick and thin… and showing LA and California and the entire country the power of our unions.Because workers are fed up. They’re exhausted and frustrated and for many of them, the pandemic was the tipping point. They’re tired of risking their health and safety for a crappy job and being told that they were “essential” one minute and expendable the next.They’re burnt out. Tired of the unfair treatment and toxic environments and poor management. And they’re looking to the labor movement and collective action as a vehicle for change.And Los Angeles is showing us how it’s done. Through strengthening our workplaces… like organizing the 17,000 research assistants in the UC system. That’s huge. And through strengthening our communities… For decades the labor movement has been connecting working families in times of need to vital aid and services and the pandemic was no different… Food drives and vaccination clinics… housing and unemployment support and more… The Los Angeles labor movement has been at the forefront… empowering workers and empowering communities as we continue to recover from this crisis.And we will be at the forefront in electing pro-worker candidates this fall… as you were in 2020… and you were a total game-changer in last year’s recall attempt. The 2022 elections are upon us and we have been building out the framework for our political plan nationally and we know we have to approach it differently this time.We are going to need to do some deep listening and get back to the basics. Reestablish credibility through face-to-face conversations, especially at worksites.Those conversations will surface the issues that really matter to our members and then we can connect those issues to the candidates when it’s time to get out the vote.And we already have plenty of things to talk about with our members.The American Rescue Plan… the bipartisan infrastructure bill – those were huge victories.It will put people to work across Southern California fixing roads and bridges, improving our ports and airports and water infrastructure, installing broadband and electric vehicle charging stations… and thousands upon thousands of good, union jobs for Angelenos.We are still pushing Congress to Build a Better America, which includes getting a key piece of the PRO Act passed so employers who violate our right to organize are met with REAL consequences for breaking the law. And we have the opportunity to deliver that and so much more for working families. Infrastructure is more than just roads and bridges and broadband. It is also health care and home care and education.Because that new road or bridge isn’t so great if you can’t use it to get to work because you don’t have access to child care, elder care, dependent care.We’re going to keep pushing to make sure quality, accessible child care remains a priority. So many people, mainly women, have been sidelined during the pandemic because they’re primary caregivers. The child care system in our country is badly broken and HAS to be fixed!!This isn’t just a women’s issue. This is a family issue. This is a working person’s issue. This is a core economic issue. The pandemic made that clear. Most of the workers in the care economy are women of color – they’re doing the care work that makes all other jobs possible. That’s the bottom line.We absolutely have to connect these victories back to our pro-worker administration and Congress… and our pro-worker governor and legislature.Because there is so much misinformation and disinformation out there and it is dividing our country.One America is being fed one set of information and the other America something else. It’s destabilizing. It’s divisive. And it is shaking the very foundation of our democracy.But we are in a unique position… we can help close the information divide and heal our democracy. We can be that trusted source of information.We can cut through the noise with one-on-one, face-to-face conversations, and that will make all the difference.Let’s be the difference makers. Let’s keep the momentum rolling.Let’s commit to reaching out to our members in new ways.Let’s be bold and not be afraid to try new things.Let’s wake up every morning thinking about organizing new workers and building the most dynamic, inclusive and modern movement to meet this moment! Thank you![pause]And now it is my pleasure to introduce another national labor leader who cut his teeth right here in the LA Labor MovementHe grew up here in LA and realized his dream when he was hired by the LA Fire Department at the age of 19… and 30 years later when his schedule allows, he is still pulling shifts on the truck as a fire captain.He is a proud vice president of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and has worked his way through the ranks of the IAFF… as president of Fire Fighters Local 112 here in Los Angeles… to Vice President of the California Professional Fire Fighters, to 10th District Vice President of the IAFF, and last year, he was elected to serve as the General Secretary-Treasurer of the IAFF.Sisters and brothers… please welcome a man who has dedicated his life to his family, firefighting and organized labor, our Brother… Frank Líma!

24,Redmond to GLU: Racial Justice Is Economic Justice,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-glu-racial-justice-economic-justice,3-30-2022,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following opening remarks virtually as prepared to a Global Labor University Conference discussion on racial justice and the American labor movement:
 Hello, everyone. I’m Fred Redmond, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO. We are a federation of 57 unions representing 12.5 million workers in all sectors of the economy.I’d like to thank FES, and Mark Anner and Jana Silverman and the entire team at the Center for Global Workers’ Rights at Penn State University for all the work that went into bringing this conference to life. Thank you for bringing us together.I’m glad to have the opportunity to  speak on what the American labor movement is doing to address racial justice here in the United States.As Jennifer [Bates] and Mike [Foster] helped to highlight in the last session, racial justice is fundamentally economic justice. The two are tied together.You’ve watched the fight for Black Lives Matter here in the United States… and the widespread demonstrations after the murder of George Floyd… And it became clear to me that summer… when the AFL-CIO headquarters was vandalized and a fire set in the lobby… that the Black community did not see the labor movement as an ally.And we had to ask ourselves why?We were having tough conversations on institutional bias and ways to be a more inclusive movement. And our work is centered on racial and economic justice. Yet the Black community doesn’t identify with us.And so in 2020, the AFL-CIO created a Task Force on Racial Justice to take concrete action to address America’s long history of racism, and in particular in the criminal justice system.The labor movement could not afford to be silent on this issue if we are to be a force for progress for ALL people.Now, I’ve spent my entire life fighting for racial justice in the workplace and throughout our communities, and while you may not be facing the same set of issues or injustices in the countries where you live and work…we all share the same fundamental beliefs:That we are stronger together than we are alone.That freedom of association is the key to securing decent work.That workers joining together is the best way to address the injustices and inequalities in our workplaces and in our societies.And that unions are the best vehicle to deliver the change workers want for our families and communities.But some corporations and governments don’t share our beliefs. And so they use one of our biggest strengths… our diversity… our race, religion, age, nationality, sexual orientation… to try to divide us. On union campaigns… at the bargaining table… and through policy and legislation. The fight in Bessemer exemplifies exactly that.And when they are successful in dividing us, the result is more for them and less for us… widening inequality and weakening democracy.The AFL-CIO and the American labor movement are doing everything we can to address economic and racial injustice.It starts with strengthening our rights in the workplace and at the ballot box.
 
Most workers in America want a union. In fact, 60 million of America’s workers would join a union today if they could.But in the U.S., our labor laws are broken. They prevent huge segments of workers from joining a union. And they favor employers who try to stop workers from coming together.Reforming our labor laws is essential if we want workers to have good wages and benefits, safer jobs, and more racial and gender equity… more power and prosperity.
Because equity and opportunity are baked in unions. And it's remarkable to hear our Deputy Secretary of Labor recognize that today too.A collective bargaining agreement is the single-most powerful tool to make sure all workers are included, workplaces are diverse and accessible, that there is equity in hiring practices, pay and advancement opportunities, and that workers gain the skills needed for the jobs of today, and the jobs of tomorrow.There are a couple of bills currently sitting in Congress — the Protecting the Right to Organize Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act — that will go a long way in strengthening our ability to organize.And there are a couple of other bills sitting in Congress — the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act — that will restore voting rights and make it easier for a whole bunch of people to cast their ballot and have a voice in our democracy.Suppressing the right to vote and limiting the right to organize have the same end… to sideline our voices, to limit our power.And even though we have a pro-worker majority in Congress and the most pro-union administration in our country’s history, our opponents in the Senate are using an outdated procedural rule – the filibuster – to stop these bills from moving forward..The other thing we’re doing is working to fix our criminal justice system … a system that has incarcerated and killed too many people of color… and last year the Task Force developed steps governments and law enforcement agencies can take to improve public safety.Formerly incarcerated people should have full access to government services for education, housing and employment assistance… and should be able to fully participate in our democracy, and we’re working toward that.Through the Task Force we are pioneering education and job training programs to help those who have served their time reintegrate into our communities.And the Public Safety Blueprint for Change that was also created through the Task Force will hold bad officers accountable while protecting the right of police to bargaining collectively. And if we want to guarantee a strong labor movement in the future, we have to hold ourselves accountable too. So we too are having tough conversations on race and racial justice and equality throughout our movement to make sure we are practicing what we’re preaching.Over the last year, we brought together leaders from communities of color, the LGBTQ+ community and more for critical discussions on national racial justice issues.And we surveyed our state federations and central labor councils to take a look at the work that they are doing and identify the best ways that we can collaborate to advance our racial justice agenda.I believe the labor movement has to be part of the solution and is uniquely positioned to tackle these issues and forge real change.And I hope some of the things we’re doing here in the United States to bring working people together can be applied across the globe and I am looking forward to answering any questions and discussing this further.

25,Shuler: Pennsylvania Labor Is Bringing Us Together,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-pennsylvania-labor-bringing-us-together,3-29-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO 45th Constitutional Convention:Hello, union family! I’m so happy to be with you all.Rick [Bloomingdale]—my brother and good friend—thank you for that kind introduction. You and Frank [Snyder] have made a truly dynamic team.Thank you both for your incredible leadership, and to the executive board and all of the state fed staff. I just want to recognize how hard you’ve worked to keep our labor movement moving forward through the pandemic, giving voice to our members on the front lines and fighting for the protections they needed. Thank you for your commitment and passion for our work.I know how challenging it can be to put on a convention but you’re making it look easy. And I want to thank the Allegheny-Fayette CLC and President [Darrin] Kelly for hosting us in this great city.A city Rich Trumka loved—in a state he loved. He loved coming back to Pennsylvania—back to the place where he was born and raised and where he worked the mines, and where he earned his degrees. Rich was Pennsylvania through and through. He loved this commonwealth and he loved the Pennsylvania labor movement.I miss him every day—his friendship, and I know he was a good friend to many of you. Rich always looked forward to this convention—to thank and acknowledge all of you.And he would have especially cherished the opportunity to send your fearless president off in style.Because the working families of Pennsylvania have had no better advocate than Rick [Bloomingdale]. And our democracy has had no better champion. When the mail-in ballots from the 2020 general election still needed to be counted and when it looked like the democratic processes we hold as sacred appeared to be cracking, Rick was at the front and kept making the point that courts or political appointees don’t decide the outcome of elections, voters do. And Pennsylvania voted in record numbers—and that kind of democratic participation is a strength and the right to a free and fair election shouldn’t be undermined.Rick, it has been an honor to work with you. Thank you for leading the charge for working people here in Pennsylvania and across America, and I wish you the happiest and healthiest of retirements. You deserve it.Because the past couple of years, we have had to battle, haven’t we? The pandemic, the 2020 elections, the attacks on our democracy and our rights to vote and to organize, and now the anxiety and stress of what’s happening in Ukraine and the needless suffering of the people there.The Solidarity Center has an office in Ukraine and we have been getting reports, like from the Secretary of the Confederation of Free Trade Unions in Ukraine. She was sleeping in her house in Kiev when she was woken up by a nearby explosion.When she spoke with a reporter, the first words out of her mouth were about her trade union family—how many of them either fled the country or headed off to fight. The labor movement there has mobilized people wherever they could, all around Ukraine, helping to organize bunkers and supply centers. They're taking refuge in undisclosed locations where they’re preparing resource-packages for the people who are fleeing, but also providing protective gear to those fighting on the front lines.That’s what it means to be in a union. And as they say, solidarity has no borders. And while we are pulling together our capacity as trade unions here in the U.S. and pulling together a unified response with the global labor movement, we still have to focus on staying unified here at home. Despite all the obstacles. And those who want to break us apart.The stakes are high. But I’m optimistic.Because despite being faced with a new and incredible challenge at every turn these past couple of years, working people in Pennsylvania and across the country decided to face these challenges together. Working people chose unity.We kept our country running throughout the pandemic.We showed up for our communities when it was needed most.And because we showed up for each other, America has the chance to rise from the ashes of the pandemic stronger than before. And our bold and inclusive and diverse labor movement is leading the way.We have a generational opportunity to turn the momentum you’ve created into concrete victories—to galvanize workers and win better contracts—and push Congress to pass transformational legislation.For the first time in a long time, America’s workers are using their leverage to demand fair wages and dignity at work from Erie to Philadelphia.Public support is off the charts—especially among young people. And workers are seeing unions as a vehicle for making that change more than ever before.To them, the union difference is more than just better pay and benefits. It’s also about dignity and respect and having a voice to shape workplace culture.Workers are fed up. They’re exhausted and frustrated and for many of them, the pandemic was the tipping point. They’re tired of risking their health and safety for a crappy job and being told that they were “essential” one minute and expendable the next.We’ve been hearing all over the media about people quitting their jobs, or the “Great Resignation.” But really, it’s the “Great Realignment” or the “Great Reimagination” because workers are refusing to go back to terrible jobs with low pay.But low pay is only part of the equation. We just did a survey of workers who left their job in the past two years. Not surprising, workers who quit their jobs have a lot of negative feelings about work—but what WAS surprising was that workplace culture was a driver more than pay. Unfair treatment, burnout, toxic environments and poor management were the top reasons why they left.And a majority believe that collective action could be a solution.Ironworkers at Erie Strayer. Steelworkers at ATI and NLMK. And Pennsylvania labor stood strong with all these workers in their fights for fair contracts.That solidarity was contagious! The BCTGM strike this past fall at Kellogg’s in Lancaster and at plants across the country captured the nation’s attention. 800 AFT teachers in Scranton showed incredible courage and went out in November and demanded better pay and health care and more.Just a couple of weeks ago IUE-CWA Local 144 members at City Brewery in Latrobe got back to the bargaining table after striking for equitable pay and a voice on scheduling.But when we are out organizing, and talking to people about why they should join a union, we rarely talk about workplace culture—it’s a disconnect. And something we should be reflective of as we try to reach out to the emerging workforce.And if we aren’t waking up everyday thinking about organizing, especially in this moment where working people are speaking out, standing up and demanding change like never before, then shame on us. We are in a moment!Right here in Pittsburgh—workers organizing with UFCW Local 1776 Keystone State at Coffee Tree—the faculty and staff on the Pitt campus, and health care workers at assisted living centers in Allegheny County organizing with USW.And so many more organizing wins are made possible by bringing people together… organizers from across the state sharing best practices—what works, what doesn’t—and sharing information and finding opportunities to collaborate. These regular organizing committee meetings are a model for others to follow.Pennsylvania is showing us the way. You’ve transformed the state fed into a center of gravity for worker organizing AND political activism. Because we have to do both—grow our ranks and elect pro-worker candidates up and down the ballot.The work you did in the 2020 elections was a game changer. We voted Joe Biden and the most pro-worker administration in history into office.This commonwealth was absolutely critical in delivering that victory. The advocacy and outreach of Pennsylvania’s labor movement—the voter registration campaigns—the canvassing and phone banking—writing letters and postcards to voters—it made all the difference.And here we are again, already—the 2022 elections are upon us and we seem to be more polarized than ever. We have been building out the framework for our political plan nationally, and we know we have to approach it differently this time.We’re going to need to do some deep listening and get back to basics. Reestablish credibility through face to face conversations, especially in the worksites.Those conversations will surface the issues that really matter to our members and then we can connect those issues to the candidates when it’s time to get out the vote.And we already have plenty of things to talk about: The American Rescue Plan—the bipartisan infrastructure bill—those were huge victories.It will put people to work across this state fixing roads and bridges, improving our ports and airports and water infrastructure, installing broadband and electric vehicle charging stations—an 18 billion dollar investment for Pennsylvania and tens of thousands of good, union jobs for Pennsylvanians.And we’re not done. We are still pushing Congress to Build a Better America and deliver more for working families. Infrastructure is more than just roads and bridges and broadband. It is also health care and home care and education.Because that new road or bridge isn’t so great if you can’t use it to get to work because you don’t have access to reliable dependent care.We’re working hard to make sure quality, affordable child care remains a priority. We've heard it over and over again that many people, mainly women, have been sidelined during the pandemic because they’re primary caregivers. The child care system in our country is badly broken and HAS to be fixed.This isn’t just a women’s issue. This is a family issue. This is a working person's issue. This is a core economic issue. The pandemic made that clear. Care work makes all other jobs possible. That’s the bottom line.And care jobs should be good jobs with livable wages, benefits and protections, and we’re still pushing to pass the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act.We absolutely have to connect these victories back to our pro-worker administration and Congress.Because there is so much misinformation and disinformation out there and it is dividing our country.One America is being fed one set of information and the other America something else. It’s destabilizing. It’s divisive. And it is shaking the very foundation of our democracy.But we are in a unique position—we can help close the information divide and heal our democracy. We can be that trusted source of information. We can cut through the noise with one on one, face to face conversations, and that will make all the difference.We can do this—let’s leave this convention and commit to reaching out to our members in new ways. Will you commit to a one on one conversation with every one of your members between now and the election? Let’s be bold and not be afraid to try new things.I’m so proud of everything we’ve accomplished together so far. Let’s keep the momentum rolling. I can’t wait to see where we go from here.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
26,Shuler to AFGE: You Are True Patriots,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-afge-you-are-true-patriots,3-28-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the 2022 AFGE Legislative Conference:Thank you, Everett [Kelley], for that kind introduction and for your friendship. And to you and Eric [Bunn] and Jeremy [Lannan] and the entire executive council for your incredible leadership of this great union.Hello everyone. It’s wonderful to join you at this conference. I’m honored to be here today.When I talk to people who might not be familiar with the AFL-CIO, I like to say we're a federation of unions and we represent workers in every sector—in every job imaginable—in every corner of the country—and that we look like America—that we reflect its rich diversity.And the same can be said about AFGE. You do everything. You manage our forests and parks. You inspect our food and guard our borders and secure our air travel. You run our government. You’re scientists and doctors and nurses, law enforcement and correctional officers, social workers and technicians and everything in between. And you live and work all across this great nation of ours, which you serve with dedication and pride.And many of you served our country in the armed forces.AFGE members: You are this country’s true patriots.And so it was twice as hurtful when your rights were attacked—your benefits endangered, your pay frozen, or denied altogether—locked out of your job because the Trump administration couldn’t do theirs.But because of the work you did, we now have a president who believes in the role unions have in building a fairer economy and a more just society.A president whose first actions in office was to revoke those hurtful executive orders enacted by the previous administration to limit your rights.A president who appointed a union member as Secretary of Labor.This administration understands the value of unions and is committed to making government work for the working class. And last month their Task Force on Organizing released its first report with 70 recommendations for more than 20 federal agencies and departments to make it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain.It’s clear who stands with working people—and who has tried to knock us down. And it’s our job to make that distinction clear with all of our members too.We can’t afford to go backwards—where our lives and livelihoods are treated like toys—as pawns in a deranged game of chess—where the threats of a government shutdown or debt default are used as political tactics at our expense.Our federal agencies need to be funded for the full year. End of story. No more of this continuing resolutions business.Our country has enough threats to deal with the way it is. We can’t afford to manufacture crises that damage our national security and defense readiness—or jeopardize the safety of our airways and communities—or imperil the health of our veterans. The recommendations made by the Department of Veterans Affairs to the Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission would do just that. Our veterans deserve the best care possible, and closing medical centers and clinics and outsourcing care to the private sector is not how they’ll get it. That’s a non-starter. We need to expand and improve our facilities and I know AFGE have recommendations for the VA on how to do just that.We can start by giving VA health care providers full collective bargaining rights. Transportation security officers too. There’s no reason why they shouldn’t have the same voice on the job and protections as other federal employees.Let’s get the Protecting VA Employees Act and the Rights for the TSA Workforce Act through so they too can experience the life-changing power of a union job!Let’s get the FAIR Act through too! Your pay has fallen behind after a decade of pay freezes and furloughs and budget cuts, and what small wage increases you have received hasn’t kept pace with inflation. A 5% raise isn’t asking a lot.Let’s make your demands known to the people in power!Health care. Pensions. Paid leave.Fair and equitable hiring practices. State and local funding.We have momentum, AFGE! Let’s build on it.Let’s grow the labor movement and reimagine an economy that works for working people.Everyone included, no one left behind.I can’t wait to see where we go from here.Thank you. © 2023 AFL-CIO.

27,Shuler: APWU Women Have Been the Changemakers,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-apwu-women-have-been-changemakers,3-25-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared virtually to the American Postal Workers Union's Post Office Women for Equal Rights Conference:Good afternoon, APWU women! POWER!!It is so great to be with you today. I just have to say thank you first to Joyce [Robinson], Liz [Powell], and Debby [Szeredy], you are incredible leaders and I’m proud to fight alongside you. And of course to your fearless President Mark Dimondstein. The entire APWU team has been amazing, especially during the pandemic.It is such a thrill to be you, Especially during Women’s History Month! You are fighting for gender equity and building power in our workplaces and in the union – and I just have to say thank you for being the changemakers! Organizations like POWER [Post Office Women for Equal Rights] are exactly what we need to lift up working women and move them from the sidelines… to the center of our unions.POWER helps us come together and share our stories and experiences… so we help each other become more effective leaders and motivate the next generation to take on leadership roles…from our unions, and even into public office! Because our unions need more women leaders. Full stop. Only when we are at the decision making table will we be able to build a future where equal pay is a reality. Where affordable and reliable dependent care, and benefits like paid family leave are the norm for everyone! With more women in leadership we can make sure that our work environments are free from racism and discrimination and sexual harassment… and the best way to do that is through a union contract.  Contracts like the one where 94% of APWU members just voted “yes!” for last month, securing wage and COLA increases, job security, and more!Congratulations…that is incredible. I know how hard it is to get a contract like that across the finish line.That’s the kind of win we need, and to lift up and show to all working people, especially women and young workers not yet in unions, that power of coming together.. This is a win for APWU members and their families… but it’s also a win for our communities and the labor movement as a whole. And you have the wind at your back with the recent legislative win with the Postal Service Reform Act.That was a long time coming and was a result of years of hard work... No more of that ridiculous mandate to pre-fund retiree health benefits…And it guarantees six-day delivery… finally!Finally Congress delivered on what we’ve been saying all along: That the USPS and its workers are critical to our everyday lives and we need to invest in its long term future. Because in the toughest times, political upheaval, a deadly virus spreading unchecked…you delivered. 160 million addresses. Billions of pieces of mail. Vital medication. 65 million election ballots. Care packages. And you keep on delivering…connections and lifelines for businesses to stay open and families to stay in touch. You are, have been and always will be, essential. We can all agree that the last few years haven’t been easy. Thank you never seems enough…thank you for your dedication and for everything you have sacrificed. But so much more is owed, especially to women workers. Women have been taking on most of the unpaid work at home even since before the pandemic.And this balancing act that many working women have been pulling off for decades—between home and work, kids and career—has become even more complicated. For the past two years, working women have lived in a world of constantly shifting schedules and uncertainty.Our situations have gotten harder, not easier. But we keep fighting. We keep showing up to work, showing up for our families and our communities.For generations, we have gritted their teeth and persevered. Despite unaffordable child care, undervalued labor, unequal pay. We’ve kept going—because that’s what we had to do.So it doesn’t come as a surprise that working women found hope in our unions. A voice on the job.And a strong support network of powerful women who have helped us through tough times...Challenged us to go after what we deserved...And pushed us to take on leadership roles.None of us would be here without that network of support. Women in our movement who lift each other up and help each other step into leadership roles. We all need mentors and role models. Liz Powell has been one of mine. And there are so many to point to in the APWU, like Eleanor Bailey. You know her story – Eleanor pushed New York City’s postal clerks — who were underpaid and mistreated—to join the Great Postal Strike in March 1970. She knew a woman’s place was in her union! She was a powerful voice for women’s rights and the importance of growing women’s leadership. Think about what it was like in 1970…Now there are 24 women in executive positions at APWU! I know Eleanor would be proud of how we and the 6.5 million union women across the country are moving forward together.  If there’s one thing I want to leave you with today, it’s the importance of reaching out to the women in your midst. We fought so hard to make it up that ladder, don’t pull it up behind you. Make a commitment to reach out to one young woman in your workplace or at a union meeting, and bring her into your circle.APWU Women: Let’s keep fighting for progress, together…keep growing our movement, and with fearless women like you at the forefront, I can’t wait to see where we go from here.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

28,Redmond: Louisiana Labor Is a Force for Working People,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-louisiana-labor-force-working-people,3-21-2022,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks as prepared to the Louisiana AFL-CIO Convention:Thank you, Louis (Reine), for that warm introduction, and for years of friendship.And I’d like to thank you and Julie (Cherry) and your entire team for your commitment and dedication to the labor movement and Louisiana’s working families.I know how hard you’ve worked.Through one of the most challenging times in our nation’s history.Through a public health crisis and a terrible economy…Through hurricanes Laura and Delta and Ida, and an ice storm…While facing attacks on voting rights and our democracy...And the systemic racism behind those attacks.And through all of it, you didn’t stop. You kept going. You were – and are – a force for working people… for our communities… and for our labor movement.And I’d like to thank another force for our communities, who is here with us today. Governor Edwards, you have always been a friend to working people. Thank you for helping change the narrative about unions here in Louisiana. [Pause]Now, as you all know, in August of last year, our labor movement suffered a huge loss with the untimely death of Rich Trumka. Rich and I were personal friends for over 25 years. And I know he was a friend to many of you too.
Rich loved this labor movement.And because of the labor movement, he had faith in the future. And our labor councils and state federations were a great source of his optimism…this incredible network we have to reach and support America’s workers.And he had faith in Liz Shuler. Liz is smart, tough and the right person to lead the American labor movement at the right time.And I am honored to serve alongside her as the secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO.[Pause]Rich Trumka liked to say the American labor movement must be the tip of the spear in the fight against racism. And he was right. There is no better institution in America to lead the charge.And we need to be the tip of the spear on the huge issues facing our nation today, which are the same issues facing working people today.Racial, economic and gender justice.Rights for immigrants and a path to citizenship.The suppression of our right to vote and our very democracy.[Pause]These are dire issues. A couple of weeks ago I was in Alabama with our allies and friends and fellow trade unionists for the Selma to Montgomery March.It’s the same 54 miles civil rights activists marched in 1965 to bring attention to voter suppression in the South and to get the 1965 Voting Rights Act passed, which it did.And we returned to that same route because our voting rights have been eroded… and history is repeating itself.Our votes have been suppressed through tactics that have their roots in poll taxes and literacy tests.Look at Georgia where they made it a crime to hand out water or snacks to voters waiting in terribly long lines.And they made it harder to vote by mail.And look at Texas where they are rejecting mail-in ballots at an incredible rate. In one county, a quarter of the mail-in ballots were thrown out.And so we went back to Alabama to forge a new history… to get the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Acts passed.It is no accident these attacks on our voting rights are happening now. America’s workers campaigned and mobilized and got out the vote in 2020 so that we have a democratic majority in Congress and the most pro-union administration in our country’s history.Former union staff are in key positions throughout the Biden administration.We have a union member leading the Department of Labor and who is leading a task force on organizing and worker empowerment. And they just released a report with a bunch of concrete proposals that the administration has already done… or will do in the future… to make it easier for workers to organize unions and bargain collectively.And there have been so many wins for working people coming out of Washington it’s been hard to keep up.The American Rescue Plan was huge. It gave working people the lifeline we needed when we needed it most.The child care tax credits cut child poverty in half. And pension security for millions of retirees. And the infrastructure bill is a major investment in our roads and bridges, ports and airports…In clean drinking water and high-speed internet…And in resilient transmission lines and climate change mitigation.All while creating good-paying union jobs in Louisiana and across the country.It also strengthens our supply chains and Buy America rules to help stop the outsourcing of those good union jobs.It connects prevailing wages and high labor standards to the jobs created, and I know this state fed will make sure those commitments are honored.Our work isn’t done. We need to keep pushing for President Biden’s agenda for working people. The framework includes a key piece of the PRO Act so union-busting employers who violate our right to organize will be hit with real penalties.It cracks down on tax loopholes so corporations and the wealthy finally will pay a little more of their fair share.It makes huge investments in child care and elder care so more working families can get back to work.Major energy investments… more infrastructure investments…All with working people and the long-term health of our economy in mind.We have an opportunity to build a better future for our children and our grandchildren.And we cannot let it pass us by.It is our job to communicate to our members who is delivering for them… Look, that sounds like it should be easy but there is so much misinformation and disinformation out there, a lot of folks can’t separate the truth from the lie. We can be that trusted source of information for our members and we are going to emphasize going back to a tried and true strategy. We are going to have to have more face-to-face conversations in the workplace… We are going to have to listen and build trust and talk about the issues that matter.We are going to talk about President Biden’s record… and how important it is to elect leaders like Governor Edwards… leaders who bring about the greatest change for working people.Now to build that trust, we need to show all working people that the labor movement is for them.That we are inclusive and diverse.And we need to make sure our house is in order by having tough conversations on race and racial justice and equity.  We are having those conversations through the AFL-CIO Task Force on Racial Justice. And I believe our state feds and CLCs are the key if we want to advance our racial justice agenda.Through the AFL-CIO Task Force on Racial Justice, we are focusing on expanding the role that labor can play in addressing mass incarceration in Black and Brown communities…By rolling out programs… like job training and education… to help people return to our communities with a better chance to succeed after they have served their time.I truly believe the labor movement can tackle this issue and forge real change.But if we want to guarantee a strong labor movement in the future, we must do the work now to bring younger workers, women and people of color into the fold, and encourage them to take leadership positions. We need to be prepared and have an avenue for union members ready and able to step up and fill leadership roles.There’s an energy out there. We need to capture it.We need to show all working people that the labor movement is for them.Because tens of millions of working people want in.Working people are fed up with being underpaid and overworked.And fed up with feeling unsafe in our own workplaces.Workers want and deserve the rights and respect that come with a union card.It’s critical for all of us to continue to organize… to keep building our capacity… and to keep engaging with our communities.We have a generational opportunity.Let’s be out front.Let our members see us and hear us.Let’s show them that there’s nothing we can’t do when we stand together.We are part of a powerful movement at a critical time.Let’s flex our muscle and build a Louisiana… and an America that works for all working people.Let’s keep going. Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

29,Redmond: Together We Can Forge a New History,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-together-we-can-forge-new-history,3-11-2022,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond's remarks as prepared for the concluding event of the Selma to Montgomery Jubilee and March:

Hello everyone. I’m Fred Redmond, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO. We are a federation of 57 labor unions and we represent 12.5 million working people across all sectors of the economy.Hank [Sanders], thank you again for being such a powerful steward of this march and the civil rights movement. To my brother Doug [Moore], I’m so grateful to be here with you today representing the labor movement.  Special thanks to Janai Nelson and the entire NAACP LDF team for inviting me to speak. At the Legacy Museum, just down the street from here, these lines from a Maya Angelou poem are inscribed:History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived. 
But if faced with courage, need not be lived again.Today we celebrate our history. How we came together to fight for voting rights…when Jim Crow was in full swing.How all of us together forced America to evaluate whether we were truly living up to our own democratic ideals. And how our efforts led to the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Thank God for that. But today we also recognize the wrenching pain of unfinished business.Jim Crow is alive and well here in the South. More than a half century after Dr. King gave his life for justice. Our votes have been suppressed through tactics that have their roots in poll taxes and literacy tests.In fact, voters in 13 states have more restrictive laws than they did in 1965.That is shameful. So this week we make a commitment to ourselves and to each other…that we will not allow history to repeat itself.That we will not repeat its wrenching pain. Together, we will find the courage to face down these threats to our rights.And beat them, once and for all.Together we can forge a new history.We are going to pass the Freedom the Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.And we will restore our rights and save our democracy for generations to come.Thank you.

30,Shuler: The State of America's Unions Is Strong,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-state-americas-unions-strong,3-11-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared for the State of the Union for Union Members virtual event:Thank you, Erika [Dinkel-Smith] for that kind introduction, and for your dedication and service to America’s working people.Hello union family!As you know, the AFL-CIO is the federation of 57 unions representing more than 12.5 million working people across every sector of our economy.It’s great to be here today with Secretary [Marty] Walsh who has been such an incredible partner as we work to support and improve the lives of America’s working families. Working people have been through so much these past few years.But President Biden and Vice President Harris and this entire administration continue to show us how committed they are in creating an economy with working people at the center.It was great to hear President Biden reaffirm his commitment in last week’s State of the Union address. He talked about Made in America and passing the PRO Act. He said clearly “when a majority of Americans want to form a union, they shouldn’t be stopped.” And President Biden means what he says, and he’s right: the way to fix decades of rising inequality and stagnant wages is by investing in our country and our people through union jobs.Today marks the one year anniversary of the president signing the American Rescue Plan. It was the lifeline our country desperately needed… economic relief for America’s businesses, workers and families. Pension relief for our incredible retirees. And expanded and accelerated vaccination efforts, allowing us to safely get back to work and school.And after decades of neglect, this president turned the promise of infrastructure into a reality – a historic investment in our roads and bridges and transit and rail. Climate change mitigation. Clean drinking water and so much more. And the work of rebuilding our nation’s critical infrastructure will go to highly skilled and trained union professionals, thanks to President Biden’s executive order on Project Labor Agreements. President Biden knows we can’t stop now. His Building a Better America agenda has the investments we need to keep our country strong. Child care. Clean energy jobs. Lower prescription drug costs. First-of-their-kind penalties against employers who break the law when we try to organize. All right here in America.  The Biden agenda will revitalize our manufacturing sector and strengthen our supply chains … lowering prices and raising wages with family-supporting jobs for working people everywhere.With the current administration on our side, we have unlimited potential right now to seize this moment to reimagine and rebuild an economy with workers at the center.Just look at the Worker Organizing and Empowerment Task Force chaired by Vice President Harris with Secretary Walsh right by her side. They have already identified nearly 70 ways federal agencies can support the formation of unions!This is the bold agenda working people voted for.And not a moment too soon.America’s workers are in motion. Coast to coast, workers are speaking out, standing up and demanding change… for better wages and working conditions… and a better future for our families.And America’s workers are looking to unions as the vehicle to get to that better future. It’s up to us to organize workers in all sectors and we are… from Amazon to university research assistants… to Starbucks and video game developers! And together with the Biden-Harris administration, we’re going to keep mobilizing to pass the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act… so workers can organize freely and without fear…  and pass federal voting rights protections so we all can exercise our rights and have a say in the direction of this country. Work connects us all. And working people are the most powerful force for progress, at work, in our unions, in our economy and in our democracy. 
 
The state of America’s unions is strong. And there is no doubt in my mind that a year from now, under the continued leadership of the Biden administration, we will be even stronger.Thank you.And now I have the honor to introduce to you, our union brother, who has brought first-hand union experience to his job as our Secretary of Labor…he wakes up every morning thinking about how he can use his office to make life better for working people. He’s walked picket lines, helped settle strikes, worked the legislative and regulatory process on our behalf, and most importantly has the trust and confidence of President Biden. Please welcome, card carrying member of  Laborers’ Local 223 out of Boston, Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh.

31,Shuler: We Will Never Give Up on Voting Rights,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-we-will-never-give-up-on-voting-rights,3-6-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared at the Selma to Montgomery March Jubilee bridge dedication event:I’m Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO. I bring solidarity on behalf of our 57 unions and 12.5 million members.The labor movement is here. We always have been. We always will be. Madame Vice President, it is an honor to stand by your side again today. AFSCME President Lee Saunders, my brother, my friend. The legendary Bill Lucy.All of the union members here today: this fight is our fight. And to the event organizers, especially Hank Sanders, thank you for keeping the spotlight on Selma. In January, when the Senate blocked voting rights a few days after Dr. King’s birthday, I remember feeling exasperated. Why is it so hard to pass something we should all agree on?But standing here at the foot of this bridge, I am reminded that our civil and labor rights heroes have overcome greater obstacles than the filibuster.John Lewis was beaten within an inch of his life. But he didn’t stop. And the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act became the law of the land. Striking sanitation workers, AFSCME members all, took on entrenched racism in the city of Memphis and the United States of America, and won. And Dr. King gave his life in the process. All these years later there are workers at an Amazon plant here in Alabama, most of them Black, demanding the same dignity and rights as their forefathers in Memphis.All these years later we are still fighting for the fundamental right to vote…for our very democracy…in the face of a power structure built on keeping people of color down. But I think about Dr. King’s dream and his drive and I know we must finish the job. I think about John Lewis, bloodied and beaten, carrying on. Moving forward. Inspiring generations. It fills me with hope. I have hope that we will pass the bill that bears his name: the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. And the Freedom to Vote Act right alongside it. Let us pledge on this day…on this bridge…to never give up. The heroic labor leader Bayard Rustin said: We need, in every community, a group of angelic troublemakers.With the angels of Dr. King, Congressman Lewis and so many others guiding us, let’s make good trouble. Let’s march. And protest. And fight. And lobby. And take arrest if we have to. Let’s keep doing it. Every single day.To win voting rights. And worker rights. And democracy for all. The labor movement is all in. Thank you!

32,Shuler: AFSCME Women Showed Up for Our Communities,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-afscme-women-showed-our-communities,3-4-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the AFSCME Council13 Biennial Women's Conference:Good evening AFSCME women!Wow you picked a perfect place for the conference — there’s chocolate everywhere…it smells like chocolate in the hallways…even the shampoo in the rooms was chocolatey. And thanks to the BCTGM Local 464 chocolate workers union for making it all possible!Thank you, Michele [Brookins], for the kind introduction, and for your decade of dedication on the Women’s Committee. And thank you to everyone on the Women’s Committee who put in the time and effort to put on this conference. It’s amazing isn’t it?And to the men: Dave [Henderson] thank you for your steadfast leadership of this great council, which truly does make Pennsylvania happen. And to Rick [Bloomingdale] and Frank [Snyder], thank you for your incredible dedication and passion for Pennsylvania’s working families and for our movement.And it’s an honor to be speaking between two fabulous women. Gisele [Fetterman], I’m so inspired by your work with female entrepreneurs. And joining a spouse on the campaign trail—as a mother of three—I can’t imagine...but it can’t be for the faint of heart.And Elissa [McBride], you have not only been a force within AFSCME, but a smart, savvy and strong leader within the AFL-CIO, and I appreciate your support and leadership so much.It’s so great to be in the same room with so many amazing women! I’m excited to be here with you all to kick off the weekend…what a fantastic program you have scheduled between tomorrow’s sunrise and sunset yoga sessions! We could all use some more mindfulness in our lives right?Because these last two years…we have battled haven’t we? It felt like we were being hit from all sides…from politics to the pandemic…and per usual, working women took the brunt of it.Women kept our country running throughout the pandemic. And that includes the women in this room…and women in every county, township, and corner of Pennsylvania….who worked in our hospitals and schools, on our docks and police forces, who drove buses and drove policy… You showed up and you improved our communities when we needed it most. I want to thank you for everything you’ve sacrificed. You are absolutely essential—and not just during a pandemic.But so much more is owed than just saying thank you. 
 
Women have been underpaid, undervalued, and expected to take on most of the unpaid work at home even since before the pandemic.And this balancing act that many working women have been pulling off for decades—between home and work, kids and career—has become even more complicated. For the past two years, many working women have lived in a world of constantly shifting schedules and mounting uncertainty.Dependent care has gotten harder to find—or disappeared entirely. Schools closed—or went online.Our situations have gotten harder, not easier. But we kept fighting. We kept showing up to work, showing up for our families and showing up for our communities.And because we showed up for each other, America has the chance to rise from the ashes of the pandemic stronger than before. And the labor movement…with women at the center…is leading the way. We have a generational opportunity to turn the momentum you’ve created into concrete victories…to galvanize workers and win better contracts…and push Congress to pass transformational legislation.For the first time in a long time, America’s workers are using their leverage to demand fair wages and dignity at work from Erie to Philadelphia.And they’re seeing unions as a vehicle for making that change more than ever before. Public support is off the charts…especially among young people.There’s an energy out there and we need to harness it to grow the labor movement, and reimagine an economy that works for working people. Everyone included, no one left behind. And because we showed up for each other we have everything lined up. In 2020, we voted Joe Biden and the most pro-worker administration in history into office.This commonwealth was absolutely critical in delivering that victory. The advocacy and outreach of Pennsylvania’s working women…the voter registration campaigns…the canvassing and phone banking…writing letters and postcards to voters…it made all the difference. And of course the face-to-face conversations. We need to have more of those in the workplace now that it is becoming safer to do so. Those in-person conversations will be crucial if we want to lay the groundwork and educate our members about the issues and the candidates that will bring about the greatest change for working people.And we already have plenty of examples for those conversations…how our votes translate to legislation that supports working families. The American Rescue Plan and the historic investment in infrastructure—those were huge victories.It will put people to work across the country fixing roads and bridges, improving our ports and airports and water infrastructure, installing broadband…millions of good, union jobs for men AND women. Vice President Harris said it best: “Hard hats are unisex.”And we’re not done. We are still pushing Congress to Build Back Better and deliver more for working families. Because infrastructure is more than just roads and bridges and broadband. It is also health care and home care and education.Because that new road or bridge isn’t so great if you can’t use it to get to work because you don’t have access to reliable dependent care. We’re working hard to make sure quality, affordable child care remains a priority. We've heard it over and over again that many people, mainly women, have been sidelined during the pandemic because they’re primary caregivers. The childcare system in our country is woefully insufficient and that has to be fixed.Because this isn’t just a women’s issue. This is a family issue. This is a working person's issue. This is a core economic issue. The pandemic made that clear. Care work makes all other jobs possible. That’s the bottom line.And care jobs should be good jobs with livable wages, benefits and protections.None of these are new issues of course. For generations, working women have gritted their teeth and persevered. Despite unaffordable child care, undervalued labor, unequal pay. We simply kept going—because that’s what we had to do.So it doesn’t come as a surprise that working women found hope in our unions. A voice on the job. The power of the collective where equal pay and benefits like paid family leave are the norm, and a work culture where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.And we found in our unions a strong support network that helped us through tough times, challenged us to go after what we deserved, and pushed us to take on leadership roles.Everyone here has a story about what brought them into the labor movement. For me, it was learning how women catalyze change by connecting with each other. Even in those early days...When I was 11 years old. I used to babysit...and one day I asked my friend Brenda, the other babysitter on the block, how much she was making. Turns out I was getting short changed. So we decided to stand together...and we raised our hourly pay together. And I knew I wanted to be part of our movement when I saw how the clerical workers I worked with at my hometown local electric company Portland General Electric—were treated differently. We didn’t get the same respect as the power linemen who worked in the field. The difference? The men in the field—and they were all men—they had a union. That’s how I got my start: by mobilizing and organizing for equity. And we reach leadership through a simple but important strategy: working with and standing on each other’s shoulders — the women in our movement lifting each other up. That’s what’s powerful about this conference. You’re supporting one another and building the skillsets we need to lead in our unions and our communities.And the more women lead, the more we organize, the more leverage we have to win progress…today and for the next generation too.We are now 6.5 million strong and growing. The labor movement is the largest organization of working women in the country, and we are on track to be the majority of union members in a few years.
 
I want every woman in every type of job to see they have a place in our movement. That we are a force for women’s economic, cultural and political progress.And I want women to see women leading at every level…The labor movement needs you. If you’re thinking about stepping up into leadership — or if you’re not, because you’re saying, I’m not “qualified” enough yet — I want to encourage you to think again.When I was still new to this movement back in Oregon, I was offered a position to work for the  international office of the IBEW in Washington D.C. And I remember I actually tried to talk my future boss out of offering me the job. Out of ALL the talented people he could choose to promote—I couldn’t believe he thought that I had the skills he was looking for. Does that sound familiar to anyone? I’ve since learned that this is a pretty common reaction when women are given the opportunity to lead.But while you’re talking yourself out of it, there’s a guy somewhere, who is less qualified, saying, “yeah, why not? I can do that!” Take that next step even if it might make you uncomfortable. Taking that job and moving to Washington was the scariest thing I’d ever done. But it was that thing that got me out of my comfort zone and forced me to grow…personally and professionally. Still, becoming a woman leader in the labor movement can be tough. I know from experience.When I joined the staff of my local union nearly 30 years ago, I was not only the youngest person in the room, but often the only woman … surrounded by these big, burly power linemen. It was intimidating at times. But I was fortunate to have had some great mentors help me advance through the union ranks. We all need that—not one of us can make that journey on our own. More and more women are taking formal and informal leadership roles at every level of our unions and our movement. (Hey!) We are serving as executive board members and vice presidents, we’re organizing workers, we’re mentoring and training the rising generation.This didn’t happen by accident. It was a deliberate effort by our unions and our movement to put into place structural elements that allowed for the possibility for women to lead. Like designing jobs that are more likely to include women…And recognizing women leaders look at things differently than men and so we should have the freedom to lead in a way that plays to our strengths…like collaborating and offering opportunities for engagement and building consensus… We don’t have to mimic a masculine style in order to be an effective leader. We can redefine what leadership looks like. And in doing so, we redefine the labor movement. We are building a bold and inclusive labor movement with women and people of color at the center. A dynamic and inclusive movement—a movement that everyone can see themselves in.We need to bring in every single worker—across age, race, background, and industry—while staying nimble. We need to organize ourselves so we can respond at a moment’s notice, when our collective action can make the biggest difference and the most lasting gains.That’s my vision for labor: A modern movement ready to meet the demands of the modern economy.That is the labor movement that is going to help us build back better from this pandemic and go even further. Together, we can change solo fights to collective ones, unjust contracts to fair ones, bad jobs to good ones.AFSCME women: We have the power to make extraordinary change. We can demand and win better deals for ourselves and for generations to come.I’m proud of everything we’ve accomplished together so far. Let’s keep the momentum rolling. I’m excited to see where we go from here.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
33,Shuler to UFT: Women Are Speaking Truth to Power,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-uft-women-are-speaking-truth-power,3-4-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared virtually to the United Federation of Teachers HERstory celebration event:

Thank you, Janella [Hinds], for that introduction and for your dedication and leadership. I think I see your President Michael Mulgrew on as well – I wanted to say thank you not only for your incredible leadership at UFT, but also of the broader labor movement in New York City, and of course at the CLC table. The UFT leads the way for all of us, and I’m so honored to be with you for this wonderful event.Hello everyone out there in virtual world, and Happy Women’s History Month! Or should I say HERstory month?I’m so excited to be with you to recognize the accomplishments and legacy of women in our movement and beyond.And a woman I certainly look to as an example of bold leadership is your national AFT President Randi Weingarten. When people use the word “tireless” I think of Randi because she is leading in every important fight, and inspires me each and every day. And boy are we in need of inspiration… These last couple of years have been, how shall I say it…challenging, to say the least. It felt like we were being hit from all sides…from politics to the pandemic…and per usual, working women took the brunt of it.
 
Women kept our country running throughout the pandemic. And that includes every woman joining us today….our healers and educators who worked in our hospitals and homes and schools and were there for our communities when we needed it most.I want to thank you for everything you’ve sacrificed. You are absolutely essential—and not just during a pandemic.But so much more is owed than just saying thank you.Women have been underpaid, undervalued, and expected to take on most of the unpaid work at home even since before the pandemic.And this balancing act that many working women have been pulling off for decades—between home and work, kids and career—has become even more complicated. For the past two years, many working women have lived in a world of constantly shifting schedules and mounting uncertainty.Our situations have gotten harder, not easier. But we kept fighting. We kept showing up to work, showing up for our families and showing up for our communities.And if the pandemic taught us one thing, it’s that you – our teachers and counselors, nurses and therapists, lab technicians and aides and more – you are the glue – you hold our communities together. America knows that. And your union family knows that and we will be sure to remind management and public administrators of your commitment and dedication to our communities if you do not get the gratitude and appreciation you deserve as heroes. As you saw earlier in that great video, we will remind them at the bargaining table. And if we need to, we will remind them arm in arm, loud and proud in the streets. Because you deserve better pay and working conditions…and the resources you need to care for your patients and teach your students. Because we will not allow hospitals to put profits over people. Or allow our education system to be underfunded and risk the future of the next generation….and risk the future of these noble professions.
 
I have heard from a number of health care workers and educators that they are considering changing careers…not because they want to...but because the demands and working conditions have become untenable….  And that is an absolute tragedy.And I have also heard it over and over again that many people – mainly women – have been sidelined during the pandemic because they’re primary caregivers. The child care system in our country is woefully insufficient and that has to be fixed.Because this isn’t just a women’s issue. This is a family issue. This is a working person's issue. This is a core economic issue. The pandemic made that clear. Care work makes all other jobs possible. That’s the bottom line.And care jobs should be good jobs with livable wages, benefits and protections.None of these are new issues of course. For generations, working women have gritted their teeth and persevered. Despite unaffordable child care, undervalued labor, unequal pay. We simply kept going—because that’s what we had to do.So it doesn’t come as a surprise that working women found hope in our unions. A voice on the job. The power of the collective where equal pay and benefits like paid family leave are the norm, and a work culture where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.And we found in our unions a strong support network that helped us through tough times, challenged us to go after what we deserved, and pushed us to take on leadership roles.I would not be here without that network of support. Women in our movement who lift each other up and help each other step into leadership roles. I had the privilege of being mentored by so many in the movement. From my first organizing job at Portland General Electric where I helped my mom and the other female clerical workers join a union…to the role I’m in today…and every turn along the way there has been a hand extended to pull me up.For me and so many other women, that support has been life-sustaining. That is what we must do, especially for the young women who are new to our movement and are starting out in their own careers. 
 
And to the men out there – you can be our allies in this as well! We all have a responsibility to turn around and pull up the person behind us. We should always be laser-focused on recruiting and retaining our women members…not only through apprenticeships and leadership programs but also by creating an environment where women can thrive. The truth is that women have always been a force in our movement. We were instrumental in shaping it into an effective vehicle for transforming the lives of working people. But many of our contributions have not been recognized.Now we have an opportunity to empower women and give us leadership in ALL its forms. We do that by expanding the model of leadership. We don’t have to mimic a masculine style in order to be an effective leader. We can redefine what leadership looks like. And in doing so, we redefine the labor movement.Across the country and right here in New York, women are speaking truth to corporate power. We are out in front. 
 
We are raising our voices on the picket lines and leading strikes and organizing drives.  This is what a bold, inclusive and modern labor movement looks like. A movement that is reflective of the workforce, with women, particularly women of color, at the center of everything we do.A movement where young people can find unity and solidarity and activism…and develop into leaders and make lasting change.We have the chance to rise from the ashes of the pandemic stronger than before and reimagine an economy that works for working people. Everyone included, no one left behind.And a strong, unified labor movement is the force to achieve that dream.Let’s take the necessary steps to become an unstoppable force for transformation and progress. Let’s continue to partner, collaborate and learn from each other. We can achieve so much more…together.
  
Thank you, women of UFT! I am so excited to see where we go from here.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
34,Shuler: ILA Women Have the Power,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-ila-women-have-power,3-4-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared virtually to the International Longshoremen's Association Women's Conference:ILA Strong Global Power!Thank you, Dennis [Daggett] for the warm welcome, and for your incredible leadership for Longshoremen and for our movement, and for your friendship and solidarity – the ILA is always there.And Alan [Robb] thank you for your steadfast leadership of the South Atlantic and Gulf Coast District Council. And Vince, thank you for your dedication and passion for Jacksonville’s working families.And to Lovette [McGill]…my sister and friend…for your years of service to the movement. You are union to the core.Thank you for the invitation and I’m so excited to be here with you for the first ever Women’s conference— and just as women’s history month is getting started.It’s so great to be joining so many amazing women! What a fantastic lineup! There’s a lot of shared wisdom and insight and history and strategic thinking that went into this.Because we could all use some more wisdom and insight in our lives, right?These last two years…we have battled haven’t we? It felt like we were being hit from all sides…from politics to the economy to the pandemic…and per usual, working women took the brunt of it.Women kept our country running throughout the pandemic. Especially you, the longshore workers here today…the lashers and crane operators and hustlers…the shuttle drivers and porters and clerks and checkers…Women were doing it all and you kept our goods moving under the toughest of conditions. You showed up and got the job done when America needed it most. COVID really hit our ports hard in the early days of the pandemic. When we didn’t know a lot about the virus…when we didn’t have the protective equipment we needed much less a vaccine. Let me just say THANK YOU. Thank you for your sacrifice, your tenacity and your courage. There’s been all this talk about “essential workers” because people finally woke up and realized all the work and that their lives depend on a whole ecosystem of workers behind the scenes who make their world possible. But let me tell you—Longshoremen— you were, are and will always be essential!But so much more is owed than just saying thank you. 
 
Women have been underpaid, undervalued, and expected to take on most of the unpaid work at home even since before the pandemic.And this balancing act that many working women have been pulling off for decades—between home and work, kids and career—has become even more complicated. For the past two years, many working women have lived in a world of constantly shifting schedules and uncertainty.Dependent care has gotten harder to find—or disappeared entirely. Schools went online.Our situations have gotten harder, not easier. But we kept fighting. We kept showing up to work, showing up for our families and showing up for our communities.And because we showed up for each other, America has the chance to rise from the ashes of the pandemic stronger than before. And the labor movement…with women like you at the center…is leading the way. We have a generational opportunity to turn the momentum of this moment into concrete victories…to galvanize workers and win better contracts…and push Congress to pass transformational legislation.For the first time in a long time, America’s workers are using their leverage to demand fair wages and dignity at work from Miami to Maine.And workers are seeing unions as the place for making that change more than ever before. Public support is off the charts…especially among young people.There’s an energy out there and we need to harness it to grow the labor movement, and reimagine an economy that works for working people. Everyone included, no one left behind. And when we reach out to our members this year as the elections get closer…and we have those all-important face-to-face conversations in the workplace now that it is becoming safer to do so…we need to unpack all the things we have won in the last year…and how those investments are going to impact people's lives.And we already have plenty of examples for those conversations…The American Rescue Plan was a huge victory.And I don’t need to tell this group how critically important passing the infrastructure bill was….$17 billion…billion with a B…to repair and improve our ports and waterways…which translates to so many good, union jobs for men AND women. Vice President Harris said it best: “Hard hats are unisex.”And we’re not done. We are still pushing Congress on the Build Back Better bill, which will deliver even more for working families. Because infrastructure is more than just roads and bridges and ports and airports. It is also health care and home care and education.The labor movement is working hard to make sure quality, affordable child care remains a top priority. We've heard it over and over again that many people, mainly women, have been sidelined during the pandemic because they’re primary caregivers. The child care system in our country is badly broken and needs to be fixed.But this isn’t just a women’s issue. This is a family issue. This is a working person's issue. This is a core economic issue. The pandemic made that super clear. How many women here today had to pass up that call at the hiring hall to care for their families? And how long did you have to wait until the next ship came in?Care work makes all other jobs possible. That’s the bottom line.And care jobs should be good jobs with livable wages, benefits and protections.None of these are new issues though, right? For generations, working women have gritted their teeth and persevered. Despite unaffordable child care, undervalued labor, unequal pay. We simply kept going—because that’s what we had to do.So it doesn’t come as a surprise that working women are finding hope in our unions. A voice on the job. The power of the collective where equal pay and benefits like paid family leave are the norm, and a work culture where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.And we have a strong support network that helps us through tough times, challenges us to go after what we deserve, and pushes us to take on leadership roles…which is so important for women working in such a male-dominated industry.Everyone here has a story about what brought them into the labor movement. For me, I knew I wanted to be part of our movement when I saw how my mom and the women we worked with—clerical workers at Portland General Electric—were treated differently. They didn’t get the same respect as the power linemen who worked in the field. The difference? The men in the field—and they were all men—they had a union. So we launched an organizing drive. That’s how I got my start: by mobilizing and organizing for equity. And I’ve reached this leadership point through a simple but important strategy: working with and standing on the shoulders of the women in our movement. I would not be here without that network of support. Women in our movement who lift each other up and help each other step into leadership roles.That’s one of the powerful ideas behind this conference. You’re supporting one another and building the skill sets we need to be leaders in our unions and our communities.And the more women lead, the more we organize, the more leverage we have to win progress…today and for the next generation too.We are now 6.5 million strong and growing. The labor movement is the largest organization of working women in the country, and we are on track to be the majority of union members in a few years.
 
I want every woman in every type of job to see they have a place in our movement. That we are a force for women’s economic, cultural and political progress.And I want women to see women leading at every level…The labor movement needs you. If you’re thinking about stepping up into leadership — or if you’re not, because you’re saying, I’m not “qualified” enough yet — I want to encourage you to think again.When I was still new to this movement back in Oregon, I was offered a position to work for the  international office of the IBEW in Washington D.C. And I remember I actually tried to talk my future boss out of offering me the job. Out of ALL the talented people he could choose to promote—I couldn’t believe he thought that I had the skills he was looking for. Does that sound familiar to anyone? I’ve since learned that this is a pretty common reaction when women are given the opportunity to lead.But while you’re talking yourself out of it, there’s a guy somewhere, who is less qualified, saying, “absolutely, I can do that!” …even if they don’t have the experience or the skills…but they have the confidence.Take that next step even if it might make you uncomfortable. Taking that job and moving to Washington was the scariest thing I’d ever done. But it was that thing that got me out of my comfort zone and forced me to grow…personally and professionally. Still, becoming a woman leader in the labor movement can be tough. I know from experience.When I joined the staff of my local union nearly 30 years ago, I was not only the youngest person in the room, but often the only woman … surrounded by big, burly power linemen. I KNOW you all have had similar experiences. It can be off putting at times, right? But I was fortunate to have had some great mentors who helped me advance through the union ranks. We all need that—not one of us can make that journey on our own. More and more women are taking formal and informal leadership roles at every level of our unions and our movement. We are serving as executive board members and vice presidents, we’re organizing workers, we’re mentoring and training the rising generation.This doesn’t happen by accident. It has to be intentional or it won’t happen. Our unions have to put into place structural elements that allow for the possibility for women to rise up and to lead. Even small things like how a job gets posted— and how it’s described. You can do that in an intimidating way, or a more inclusive way. And recognizing women leaders look at things differently than men—and making space for us to lead in a way that plays to our strengths.We can redefine what leadership looks like and in doing that, we redefine the labor movement. We are building a bold and inclusive labor movement with women and people of color at the center. A dynamic and inclusive movement—a movement that everyone can see themselves in.We need to bring in every single worker—across age, race, background, and industry—while staying nimble. We need to organize ourselves so we can respond at a moment’s notice, when our collective action can make the biggest difference and the most lasting gains.That’s my vision for labor: A modern movement ready to meet the demands of the modern economy.That is the labor movement that is going to help us build back better from this pandemic and go even further. Together, we can change solo fights to collective ones, unjust contracts to fair ones, bad jobs to good ones.Women of the ILA: We have the power to make extraordinary change. We can demand and win better deals for ourselves and for generations to come.I’m so proud of everything we’ve accomplished together so far. Let’s keep the momentum rolling. I’m excited to see where we go from here.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
35,Shuler: Democracy Is at the Heart of Steelworkers,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-democracy-heart-steelworkers,3-1-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared at the United Steelworkers Executive Board oath ceremony:Good morning! It is so great to be here with you today!Tom [Conway], thank you — you have not only been a force within the Steelworkers, but a  smart, savvy and strong leader within the AFL-CIO, and I appreciate your support and leadership so much. John Shinn, thank you for your incredible dedication and passion for our movement — and Fred Redmond, my partner at the AFL-CIO who I am so grateful for, and is bringing the steelworkers voice inside the federation now as Secretary-Treasurer! And to all the officers and the entire Steelworkers executive board, thank you for your service and dedication to working people across the country, Canada, and the world.It is such an honor to be here with you today, swearing in day…where you pledge, before family and friends…your oath to the union and the members we serve…to be a good steward of resources…to uphold the core values of the labor movement…and to lead with direction and purpose so that the labor movement of the future is bigger, stronger and better than it is today.As I stand before you there’s no doubt about our direction. We’re moving forward, to a future defined by and for working people. On the turnpike yesterday…on the drive up from D.C….my coworkers and I were talking about the democratic process in your union, and the strong tradition you have of every voice being heard. It’s at the heart of the Steelworkers, and it’s what we stand for in the labor movement – we thrive on democracy. Our contracts, our elections, our culture all depends on the strong voice of our members and everyone paying attention and participating. And that’s so important, especially right now. We are watching what’s happening thousands of miles away in Ukraine, we’re seeing the attacks on democracy there, and also right here in the United States. The basic right to vote and our right to organize.Our electoral system is being undermined in the media, online forums, in homes across America, at worksites and yes, even in our union halls.We are living in an America that has never been so divided. It’s almost like we’re living in two Americas….one America is being fed one set of information and the other America something else. Within our own country, people witness the same event but see entirely different things.We get into these feedback loops on Facebook or Instagram and we’re fed content from algorithms designed to pull us in, and when we do engage with it, we are fed more of the same and it creates an echochamber…and when we venture out of our bubbles to talk to family or friends or our co-workers about an issue, the conversation can become challenging because our facts…what we believe as true…are so far apart.Misinformation and disinformation is one of…if not the greatest…threats facing our democracy today.It destabilizes our foundation and divides us from one another.But the labor movement has a unique role to play. We are the only force in the country with enough power and reach to close the information divide and heal our democracy. We can be that trusted source of information.And have the face-to-face conversations in the workplace about the threats we face. And we can use our workplace conversations to lay the groundwork and educate our members the issues and the candidates that will bring about the greatest change for working people. Because working people agree on a lot, even in a divided country. And it’s clear working people are hungry for change and refusing to settle for less. From the faculty and staff on the Pitt campus to health care workers at assisted living centers in Allegheny County. From the shipbuilders in Newport News to the health care workers in Southern California, and the ATI workers in communities across the Northeast. From refineries to steel mills to tire plants to the iron range; your members are in every sector of this nation.Workers are using their leverage to demand fair wages and dignity at work. It’s up to us to build on this momentum to grow the labor movement, and reimagine an economy that works for working people. And it is our job to be there and provide the resources and services and support so workers can form a union and win those life-changing union contracts.Thank you all for your strength and solidarity, for your activism and engagement. For your fighting spirit.And congratulations to all of you for the honor you have to serve your union and our movement. Together we will be an unstoppable force for working people.Everyone included, no one left behind.And the path we’re paving is wide and accessible—everyone is included, no one left behind. Our power to get there depends on moving as one. It depends on our collective unity…with the people in this room AND throughout the labor movement.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
36,Shuler: Detroit Is Union Strong,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-detroit-union-strong,2-26-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks by video for the Metro Detroit AFL-CIO Convention:I’m Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO. It’s good to be with you, even if it is by video.Thank you so much to Daryl [Newman] and James [Dennis] and my fellow IBEW sister Jeanette [Bradshaw] for your leadership…and the entire Metro Detroit team for your hard work and dedication. The work you’ve done and continue to do has a ripple effect and affects so many lives.Like at the Marysville ZF Plant where 350 new UAW members now have a union contract with better pay, benefits, retirement security, and more. And the baristas and cooks at Great Lakes Coffee Roasting Company. These “Comrades in Coffee” are organizing with UNITE HERE Local 24 for fair pay, sick leave, anti-harassment protections and more! Metro Detroit…you are showing the power that comes when working people stand up, speak out and bargain together to shape our futures. Every organizing win…no matter how big or small…every contract ratification…strengthens our communities and our movement.You are a force for progress in Detroit and beyond!You are a force to counter the attacks on our voting and organizing rights…and to put an end to workplace discrimination and inequities for women and people of color.[Pause]We are in a critical moment.
 
What we do right now will determine if we keep pro-worker champions like Governor Whitmer in office. If we keep our pro-worker edge in Washington. If we keep our democracy.It was truly amazing to see how so many of you sprang into action in 2020 when the election workers were counting ballots…you were there to keep them from the harassment and intimidation as we watched the folks who wanted to overturn the election try to undermine our democracy.
 
Hopefully we won’t need you to that again this November! But recent history tells us, these elections will come down to the wire.And we will need to connect with voters in new and creative ways – our members, and your neighbors, your friends and family members. We’re going to need to do some deep listening and get back to conversations in the work sites. Will need to surface the issues that really matter to our members and build that relationship of trust and credibility, since we know they’re getting their information online and there’s so much in certain information out there. But we can break through that with one on one, face to face conversations, and that will make all the difference.Just like you did with those one-on-one conversations you did on redistricting. I know the maps weren’t drawn the way they should have been, but that’s the kind of engagement we’re talking about now through November. And approaching it through an issue based lens. We also need to connect the dots on all the incredible investments that we’ve passed over the last year: The American Rescue Plan was a lifeline for millions of working families…and expanded the child tax credit, which cut childhood poverty in half! 
 
The historic infrastructure investment is another example…Creating so many good, union jobs in Detroit and across the state to fix our roads and bridges…Investments in American-made electric vehicles…like the one at the Lake Orion plant to produce the electric Chevy Silverado...Good, union jobs…for today, tomorrow and generations to come.And we have the opportunity to build on this success through Build Back Better. We’re keeping up the pressure to realize the aspirations we’ve been fighting for — a future with accessible, high quality child care, paid leave, a path to citizenship, and labor laws that work for working people.That is the power of our vote! 
 
We’re growing a bold, inclusive and dynamic labor movement. Nobody left behind… everyone included.Our doors are wide open. Let’s make sure women, people of color and young people see that! The majority of young Americans are passionate about collective action. They’re hungry for change. It’s in their DNA. Let’s tap into that energy.
 
On the AFL-CIO TikTok account — you know, the app where Gen Z does those dancing videos? — we’ve got close to a million views on one 60-second video about injustices at Amazon.
 
The interest is there, but only eight percent of young workers know where to go to organize a union! Let’s engage with them and show them they have a home in the labor movement. Let’s show them and all working people that we are the most powerful force for progress…at work, in our unions, in our economy and in our democracy.Let’s remind them that Detroit is a union city! And that our unions are Detroit strong!Keep up the incredible work and have a great convention! Thank you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
37,Redmond: Voter Suppression Is Discrimination,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-voter-suppression-discrimination,2-25-2022,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond's remarks as prepared for the 2022 Michigan A. Philip Randolph Institute Conference:Thank you Lance [Holmes] for the warm introduction.Before I begin I’d like to thank Jerry [King] and all of the APRI chapters here in Michigan for the incredible work you’re doing.And thank you to everybody whose work makes this conference possible. I’m thrilled to be joining you here today.Good afternoon. As Lance said, I’m Fred Redmond, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO.I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would be a leader of the national AFL-CIO.I will always be a regular guy...a Black kid from the south side of Chicago who navigated my way through life by trying to do the right thing.That’s the key. To do what’s right. Whether it’s for an individual, a community or a country.And that’s our guiding light in the labor movement...our collective responsibility.That’s why I’m in the labor movement. And I’m pretty sure that’s why you are too.But it hasn’t always been easy being a person of color in the labor movement, right?That’s why we had to form minority caucuses…so-called ad-hoc committees in the 40s and 50s…to address the lack of minority representation and other inequalities within our own structures.To give a voice and perspective that may not have been considered or was too easily dismissed.To open up a dialogue on the issues that divide us if left unspoken …but through discussion, bring us closer together. To carve a path for people of color to reach and succeed in leadership roles. I come out of the Steelworkers. My dad worked at an aluminum mill outside of Chicago called Reynolds, and in the summer of 1973, I took a job there and it was the best decision I ever made.Joining that union made me who I am today. It helped me find my purpose. But I faced significant challenges on the job and within the labor movement. Like my father did. And like many of you have too.In the steel mills, they sent the white workers to slit the coals. The Black workers, we had different jobs, intense jobs, dangerous jobs. We worked at the mouth of those fire-breathing, skin-melting furnaces.When I tried to get an apprenticeship in Chicago, I found out I had to go clear across town for a letter of recommendation from an elected leader. You know, many unions made it harder for Black workers to get apprenticeships, which are very important in giving folks a path to a good union job.I know you all have your own first-hand experience. But I mention it because I realize…we had a right to a job, to an apprenticeship…but there is a difference between a right and an opportunity. We had the right to be considered fairly without discrimination. But if the racist structures are still in place that allow for discrimination…then where is the opportunity?That’s the challenge of this moment. And it has always been the challenge.Now, take our voting rights. The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution stated that the right to vote cannot be denied based on race or color. Now, that only applied to men at the time, but our right to vote was established in 1870.But the opportunity to vote eluded us. Especially in the South where tactics like poll taxes and literacy tests blocked most Blacks from voting.And literacy tests wasn’t about being able to read. They were exercises in discrimination. Some voter registration offices were open only a couple of days a month. And folks would wait in line all day to register to vote only to be denied their right because they didn’t dot an “i” or cross a “t”. Or they would have to recite passages from the Constitution or answer questions on obscure government functions. Or they would have to be able to count the number of beans in a jar. Those were the literacy tests. We had the right but did we have the opportunity?The numbers tell the story. In the Deep South in the '60s, only one in three African Americans of voting age were eligible to vote. In Mississippi less than 7 percent of African Americans were registered to vote.And in Selma, Alabama, blacks made up 57 percent of the population while whites made up 99 percent of the voting rolls.The same Selma where John Lewis and scores of civil rights activists demonstrated for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and then were bloodied and beaten on the Pettus Bridge by state troopers in riot gear.Now, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were powerful pieces of legislation. And we owe a debt of gratitude to Dr. King and John Lewis and Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph and countless others whose dedication and sacrifice helped push these bills through. But if you think about it, these bills were misnamed. They are less about establishing rights than they are about limiting the discriminatory practices and the systemic racism that prevent us from accessing the rights we already have.Our voting rights. Our civil rights. Our right to organize.And we are again facing serious threats on our rights.Voter suppression and gerrymandering and limiting our right to organize… these are dire issues.And the goal of these right-wing attacks are the same… to limit our opportunity and sideline our voices.Look no further than what is happening here in Michigan. Republicans are trying to change the rules to make it harder for Michiganders to vote. They have a petition drive called Secure My Vote.And by “secure” they mean “discriminate” … By making it harder to vote absentee…. By asking for sensitive personal information like social security numbers…By throwing out the ballots of registered voters who can’t satisfy the new and restrictive identity requirements…And even by making it harder for people to volunteer to be an election official.These changes are not only anti-voter, they’re anti-democratic.If they collect enough signatures, this voter suppression package won’t be on the ballot in November. It will go straight to the legislature and become law…without it being subject to the governor’s veto.These kinds of voter suppression tactics are happening all across the country…and have happened. In fact, voters in 13 states have more restrictive laws than they did in 1965.So we need to keep pushing for our rights…and our ability to exercise our rights…and the state level and the national level too.That means doing everything we can to get the John Lewis Freedom to Vote Act across the finish line.We can say the same thing Dr. King said about the Civil Rights Act in a speech he gave here in Detroit 60 years ago. He said: “Let’s not fool ourselves. This bill isn’t going to get through if we don’t put some work in it and some determined pressure.”That “determined pressure” here is pushing the Senate to sideline the filibuster…the same tactic that threatened and killed civil and voting rights legislation in the past.Some senators are making the claim that changing the rules is some kind of moral affront. But the moral affront here is that we need to pass this bill in the first place.We know why it’s so hard to pass voting rights.There are senators who want all the power and privilege for themselves. They want to limit our opportunity.They don’t want a democracy or society that has the full scope and range of diversity and perspective.But our elected officials don’t lead…the people lead.Great leaders like Dr. King and A. Philip Randolph recognized that. They knew the people in the labor movement and the people in the civil rights movement were the two greatest forces for change. That is why they fought so hard to bring them together.And their vision was revolutionary. It’s based on the idea that a good, union job is a life-changing opportunity.We are building a movement that provides that opportunity…one that centers on people of color…and we are on a mission to bring more of us into the fold.We have to. Our workforce is changing.People of color will soon make up the majority of all working people in this country.In a few years, women will be half of the labor movement.And right now, millennials are already the largest generation in the workforce.  And today’s workforce is looking for a change. Right now, working people are fed up. The pandemic has pulled back the curtain. Workers are rejecting jobs where they risk their health and safety for a poverty wage. Workers are striking and standing up for their rights.And young people especially are embracing unions as a vehicle to speak up at work. There’s an energy out there. We need to capture it.We need to show all working people that the labor movement is for them.That the labor movement continues to demand equal pay, respect on the job, and an end to sexual harassment and discrimination in all its forms.And that the most urgent racial and social justice issues run right through the labor movement.Economic justice.Gender justice.Voting rights and strengthening democracy.Guaranteeing a path to citizenship for immigrants.All of these issues are critical to making sure that working people live a dignified life both inside and outside of the workplace.That we are able not only to exercise our rights, but that we have access to the best opportunities for ourselves and our families.How do we do that? By growing opportunities for people of color and communities that have been left out? By connecting with women and young people and communities of color….By making sure our own house is in order.We are having tough conversations on race and racial justice and equality...through the AFL-CIO’s Task Force on Racial Justice.But we need to do more than have conversations…we need to make sure our own structures empower rights AND opportunity.And we need to make sure our democracy empowers it too. The labor movement needs to be at the forefront...to combat voter suppression...discrimination…and the anti-worker laws designed to silence us.And the work of the APRI is essential. You are a force for change…in your unions and in your communities.You make sure the labor movement always aspires for progress…to do the right thing.And to be at the forefront. For social justice...for racial justice...and for opportunities. Together, in true solidarity for all working people.Thank you so much.

38,Redmond: Responsible Investing Starts with Labor,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-responsible-investing-starts-labor,2-21-2022,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks as prepared to the 45th Annual National Labor & Management Conference:Hello, everyone. I’m Fred Redmond, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO. We are a federation of 57 unions representing 12.5 million workers in all sectors of the economy.It’s good to see a lot of my brothers, sisters and friends from labor here this morning. Thank you for keeping our nation humming along.And I hope there are folks out there who represent management. Thank you for attending, for listening, for providing your own insights and perspective this weekend.And I’d like to take a moment to thank Bill [Raisch] and Barbara [McCabe] and the whole National Labor and Management team for inviting me to participate in this important conference.We’ve heard a lot of good ideas over the course of the weekend. To strengthen and grow our economy. To strengthen our communities. To make sure our investments are sustainable…good for workers and good for the environment.What has been made clear over this week is that it is going to take all of us…labor and management together…to provide real relief, build a real recovery and an equitable future.The infrastructure bill that recently passed is the shot in the arm we needed toward that recovery and future. Millions of good, union jobs to fix our roads and bridges and waterways…upgrades to our ports and airports.It strengthens our supply chains. It strengthens Buy America rules to help boost domestic manufacturing.And it takes strides to mitigate the climate crisis that jeopardizes our future…and our children’s and grandchildren’s future on this planet.This investment is long overdue.And it adds up to American jobs, benefiting workers in manufacturing and throughout the supply chain.The key phrase here is “benefiting workers.”The Biden administration recognizes it is not enough just to drive investment. It has to transform supply chains by including labor standards.And this bill does just that. It applies Davis-Bacon prevailing wage protections to new programs to make sure workers receive fair wages and come home safe.It’s building back better with resiliency in mind. And building back better with workers at the center of the policy so that the working Americans who design, build, operate, and maintain the infrastructure we all use every day can count on those jobs as good jobs.As our nation shifts away from the neglect and underinvestment of the past, we need to apply the same principle to all of our investments.To make sure our investments are responsible and sustainable. That they invest in people, by creating good jobs that pay family-sustaining wages. Investments that address climate change by protecting the environment while raising living standards in all of our communities regardless of income or zip code.
 
These goals are something we can all agree upon. They are pro-worker and pro-business. And they strengthen the economic and social bonds that hold us together. [Pause]Now look, there is an anti-union, anti-worker culture in this nation and that has to change.Unions have been pushed aside the past 40 years. Decisions about our future were made without us at the table. And now we’re seeing the cracks in the system.The generations before us had a voice on the job and earned living wages. That was done through strong union contracts, which helped create an economic system that allowed a middle class to grow. And made sure that those who built our country and contributed to its economy could support themselves and their families. We owe the generations that come after us to have that same opportunity. It is our responsibility…labor and management together…to make sure our economy hums and our communities thrive. All communities. No one left behind.How do we do that? How do we make sure our recovery from the pandemic is equitable and our future investments are sustainable?I will argue by respecting the collective power of workers who seek family-sustaining wages, good benefits, a safe job and a secure retirement through collective bargaining.Now, we can get there legislatively by fixing our broken labor laws…and I believe we will.It is a top priority of the labor movement and right now there is a bill in the Senate which I’m sure many of you are extremely familiar with. The PRO Act would protect and empower workers to exercise our freedom to organize and bargain.It would make sure that workers can reach a first contract on a fair timetable after our union is recognized.It will put real teeth in the laws that prohibit bad actors from union busting.And it will give workers in sectors currently prevented from forming a union – the some 60 million people who would vote to join a union today if given the opportunity – the opportunity to do so.That’s one way. But as we work toward demanding labor laws that catch up with what workers want and need, we need to use our voices as investors to promote sustainable business practices.This means embracing environmental, social and corporate governance standards in our investment process.And we need to demand more from companies included in sustainable investment funds.Those companies should serve all its stakeholders. Its customers and shareholders. The environment. AND workers and our communities.Those companies should be as committed to their social impact as they are to their environmental impact and corporate structure.Now, how does a company improve its social impact? By having:Reasonable working hours, good wages, and strong health and safety standards;Diversity and inclusion in hiring practices. And equity in pay and training and career advancement;Policies to prevent workplace discrimination;A commitment to keep their manufacturing and production facilities here in the United States;A commitment to allow workers to join a union without interference or harassment;And a commitment to bargain collectively in good faith.Those things should sound very familiar to union folks. Because they are. At the heart of social impact is worker rights.Now look, right now there isn’t an industry-wide set of standards to measure a company’s environmental performance, social impact and corporate governance issues.Most of the time, a company’s sustainability rating is handled by an independent rating agency.And how these rating agencies evaluate a company can be a mystery. They use different scales to weigh different criteria. Which makes what they weigh hard to quantify.For some rating agencies, if a company mentions diversity, equity and inclusion on its website, then that is enough to show the company is committed to diversity and inclusion in its hiring practices, and equity in pay. In one case, a rating agency used an employee satisfaction rating to satisfy a labor relations criteria. On Glassdoor or some shit like that.The lack of standards and oversight has rendered some of these ratings meaningless.Investors want to know whether a company is truly committed to improving the environment and society, or if it’s only committed to serving its public relations objectives.Investors want companies to disclose how they handle climate change risks, whether they treat their workers fairly, how they promote diversity in hiring and leadership.And the SEC is looking to develop standards on such disclosures, which is welcome.But if investors want to know if a company is a responsible investment, they don’t need to scan that company’s website for diversity, equity and inclusion…or count the number of stars next to that company’s name on an employment site. Investors only need to check two things:Is the company’s workforce union?And if not, is the company obstructing its workforce from forming a union?Those are the only metrics necessary. Here’s why:Unions, by design, advocate for workers’ rights and hold employers accountable. We work with employers to negotiate fair wages, fair benefits, the opportunity for advancement. Diversity and equity and inclusion aren’t just buzzwords you find on our website, these words…these values…are baked into our contracts.Because equity and opportunity are baked in unions.Unions help close the gender and racial wage gap.Here are a few statistics you won’t find on company disclosures:The hourly wages for women workers represented by a union are 4.7% higher on average than for nonunionized women workers.  Black workers represented by a union are paid 13.1% more.And Latino and Hispanic workers are paid 18.8% more.  Now, there are some companies with non-union workers who provide decent pay and benefits and share labor’s values on diversity and inclusion. But I will say this: a collective bargaining agreement ensures those wages and benefits stay decent, and our socially responsible values are adhered to.A collective bargaining agreement is the single-most powerful tool to make sure all workers are included, workplaces are diverse and accessible, that there is equity in hiring practices, pay and advancement opportunities.And that workers gain the skills needed for the jobs of today, and the jobs of tomorrow. A little known fact is that the labor movement has the largest workforce training program in America besides the U.S. military.Our unions have the best training infrastructure in the country. We create new career opportunities and pathways for those who’ve been marginalized.We partner with employers, government agencies and local communities to provide training for new and returning workers. Some 65 percent of registered apprentices are in labor-affiliated programs, contributing more than $1.5 billion a year to the economy. In our building trades, we take part in more than 1,600 joint labor-management apprenticeship training committees.And our training programs are focused on recruiting women, people of color, veterans, and the formerly incarcerated. So our workforce, in all sectors, reflects our society as a whole.The labor movement is the criteria for a diverse and inclusive workforce.But our apprenticeship and training programs make sure our members aren’t just trained, but that they are the best at what they do. Not only in construction and manufacturing, but in emerging sectors like clean energy.The renewable energy industry has doubled in size over the past decade and our unions are providing on-the-job training where workers develop the industry-recognized and portable skill sets that will be in demand for a long time to come.So workers can move seamlessly between onshore and offshore wind and solar generation and battery storage fields. So workers are trained and credentialed to install and maintain electric vehicle charging equipment so charging stations are installed safely, effectively, and up to national electric code.We are generating a skilled workforce for a good, family-sustaining career as we meet the climate crisis head on. And here’s the thing, this is not an either-or-issue. To answer the climate crisis we have to protect the environment AND keep and create good jobs.This is another key piece of sustainable investing, especially as it relates to the environmental criteria – green jobs aren't necessarily good jobs. Many of these jobs have been non-union, pay poorly, and rely on imported components, like solar cells, batteries and wind turbines.That has to change. Our resilient infrastructure companies must pay their employees well, be union represented, have labor protections that support workers...with domestic sourcing. The U.S. must not allow the use of forced labor to meet our nation’s needs. If any component is powered by forced labor, it is not “clean” energy. It’s not sustainable either.In recent years we have seen a dramatic increase in renewable energy investment by private equity, real estate and infrastructure funds. But are these private funds addressing the need for an equitable transition for workers?Our pension plans are allocating capital to private funds that are investing in the clean energy economy. This investment in America’s supply chains can set global labor standards for clean energy production.And in this department, the labor movement is making some headway in renewable wind projects.In Rhode Island, workers in the building trades built the first successful offshore wind farm in the U.S.And the work was collaborative…with the developer…through our labor-management partnership. It’s a high-road jobs strategy that we want to replicate within the entire industry and in other clean energy sectors…like carbon capture and storage.And as we move toward a clean energy future, I should note we have a trained workforce to help clean up existing oil and gas wells and abandoned mines.And miners who will mine minerals like lithium, copper, iron and nickel for energy storage, solar cells, batteries, electric vehicles and more.The renewable energy sector with good, union jobs can be the sweet spot of a sustainable investment. Good for the environment and good for workers. And good for our economy if the company has a healthy corporate governance structure.Gross inequality is another key component of a sustainable investment.And it is something America’s workers are passionate about.We have reached a breaking point. The pandemic has pulled back the curtain and is revealing the cracks. It’s putting the inequities and injustices of our systems on full display.Where Black and Brown Americans are disproportionately harmed.Where low-wage workers are called essential but treated as expendable.Where we’re pushing ourselves harder than ever only to be rewarded with disrespect. Where companies like Amazon pockets massive tax breaks while its employees live off food stamps.Where the average CEO makes 300 times the average worker – makes more in a month than many of us could ever hope to make in a lifetime.In every corner of the country — from warehouses and supermarkets to offices and hospitals — America’s workers are finding strength in each other.At Kellogg’s and Nabisco. At John Deere. These companies raked in huge profits during the pandemic…and then denied workers their fair share.America’s workers don’t want to go on strike…it is a last resort…but they are more united than ever and willing to endure hardship and uncertainty for their future…and for future generations.In Alabama…some 1,000 miners have been on strike for over 10 months at Warrior Met Coal.The coal miners gave up wages, health care benefits, pensions and more to allow Warrior Met’s coal mines to emerge from bankruptcy five years ago.Since then the company has done extremely well. But instead of investing in its workers, the profits are paid out to shareholders and hedge fund managers.The workers are struggling and the community is struggling. And corporate America is holding on to the wealth workers help create.BlackRock, which is the largest shareholder of the company, holds over 13% of its stock. Its headquarters in New York have been the spot of several protests by Mine Workers President Cecil Roberts, the miners and our allies.Employers are supposed to serve our communities, not the other way around. And this strike is about the entire community. The UWMA members support every local shop, restaurant, service, pharmacy and the people who make those businesses run.Companies that value their investors more than they value workers and their communities have no place in a sustainable investment fund.[Pause]So what do we want our future economy to look like?As labor and management, we should be heading into these decisions together. Business and labor may play different roles, but we share common goals. Each of us wants American companies to succeed. Each of us wants workers to be safe, satisfied and productive. Each of us wants a future where everyone can enjoy the fulfillment that comes with a good job.And the key to that future is through collective bargaining.When workers sit down across the table from employers and bargain, in good faith, working people bring home higher wages and have greater access to health care and a pension. We are more likely to be safe on the job.And we are more likely to be satisfied with our job. And it turns out happy, safe and well-paid workers make for really productive employees. That’s good for business and our economy.Now look, an unprofitable company does us no good. We have a vested interest in helping our employers succeed. And we will stand by those employers where workers have the freedom to bargain for a share of that success. Just as the labor movement will make prudent investments in private funds that stand with us – will take that high road to invest in labor partnerships and shared prosperity.The retirement savings of working people wield enormous power in our nation’s economy. 15 trillion dollars are invested in retirement programs in the United States. And union members are beneficiaries of 3.5 trillion dollars of pension plans.Successful investment funds recognize that creating good jobs is the best way to achieve the financial returns that our pension plans need to pay promised retirement benefits.We cannot have it any other way. We cannot make investments at the expense of working people…with investment managers who don’t share our values, who urge corporations to outsource and offshore jobs, who encourage companies to inflate their stock prices through stock buybacks instead of investing in research and development, or their own employees.We must ensure investment managers are held accountable and our investments don’t undermine the efforts of the labor movement.The labor movement has several tools that help us make informed decisions and hold investment managers accountable:We’re tracking real estate investment managers who do not have responsible contractor policies...Investment managers on how they voted on our shareholder proposals that increase corporate responsibility.

And the investment managers who support efforts to convert defined benefit plans into defined contribution plans.And we are making pro-worker investments that create good union jobs and offer competitive returns.

Real estate funds like the AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust and the Building Investment Trust create new union construction jobs and opportunities for workers, while protecting the retirement security of workers everywhere.And the AFL-CIO Equity Index Fund encourages corporations to adopt responsible business practices through shareholder activism and proxy voting. We are focused on increasing our allocations to these responsible job-creating investments. By doing so, we invest in ourselves and create an economy that works for all of us.[Pause]That’s the goal, right? An economy that works for all of us.Working together, labor and management can usher in a workforce of unprecedented skill and professionalism.Working together we can have a livable planet. Good, union jobs. And an economy centered on diversity and equity. Everybody included, no one left out. Let’s use this moment in history and do just that.Thank you.

39,Redmond: Organizing Is Key to Reversing Decades of Austerity,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-organizing-key-reversing-decades-austerity,2-16-2022,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following opening remarks virtually as prepared to a Trade Union Confederation's panel on unions organizing around the world:Hello, everyone. I’m Fred Redmond, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO. We are a federation of 57 unions representing 12.5 million workers in all sectors of the economy.Frances [O’Grady], allow me to say how grateful I am for your dedication and leadership in the UK—and globally.Thank you to all of the TUC staff for organizing and hosting this week of discussions.And it is an honor to be with such a distinguished group of workers’ advocates—Cristina Faciaben, Tamara Munoz and Gautam Modi.Our trade union movements have to navigate different political and economic landscapes, and we face unique challenges…but we share the same fundamental premise that links working people around the world—that together, we are stronger than we are alone. That workers around the world need decent work, and freedom of association is the key to securing decent work.That workers joining together is the best way to reverse the decades of austerity and corporate greed and power, which has led to gross inequalities…put our future on this planet in peril…and undermined our democracies.And we share the same fundamental belief that unions are the best vehicle to deliver the change workers want for their families and for our communities.Right now, workers are fed up. The pandemic has pulled back the curtain. And not just in the United States. We’re seeing frustrated workers airing their discontent all over the world. Workers are rejecting jobs where they risk their health and safety for a poverty wage. And workers are striking and standing up for their rights and demanding an economic model that works for all workers.The strikes that we have seen in the manufacturing, food processing and mining sectors are remarkable.At Kellogg’s and Nabisco. At John Deere. These companies raked in huge profits during the pandemic…and then denied workers their fair share.But America’s workers are more united than ever…more militant too…and willing to endure hardship and uncertainty for their future…and for future generations.In the U.S. South…in Alabama…some 1,000 miners have been on strike for over 10 months at Warrior Met Coal.  The coal miners gave up wages, health care benefits, pensions and more to allow Warrior Met’s coal mines to emerge from bankruptcy five years ago.Since then the company has done extremely well. But instead of investing in its workers, the profits are paid out to shareholders and hedge fund managers.The workers are struggling and the community is struggling. And corporate America is holding on to the wealth workers help create.But there is a renewed energy among America’s workers…especially among young people. And it is critical we harness that energy for new organizing.We’re seeing new opportunities for organizing across the country and in all sectors. University research assistants, art museum workers, video game developers and political staff members.Workers aren’t just quitting substandard jobs. They are staying to organize.They are motivated to break down the structures that allow racism and gender discrimination and sexual harassment…for having been told that they were “essential” one minute and expendable the next.We’re seeing that at Amazon. The warehouse workers in Alabama are set to vote to join a union for the second time. This comes after the National Labor Relations Board found that Amazon unfairly pressured workers to vote against a union last year.And recent reports show Amazon is employing the same union-suppression and intimidation tactics this time around.But we are seeing a level of solidarity between unions that is unprecedented in recent history.  The unions organizing the 7,000 warehouse workers in Alabama – UFCW and RWDSU – had a significant number of staff organizers on the ground. But they needed more to stand a fighting chance. The call for help went out and 15 unions from across the labor movement stepped up. And the number of organizing staff on the ground increased by 70%.This kind of solidarity between unions is essential if we are to take on America’s largest employer. Instead of getting into turf wars, we can support one another and get resources to where they’re needed most and scale up major organizing campaigns.And we have to take advantage of technology so we can use our limited resources strategically and efficiently. More and more of our unions are using a tool we developed called Action Builder, which allows us to analyze organizing data in a way that was only possible in the political sphere.Most workers in America want a union in their workplace. In fact, 60 million of America’s workers would join a union today if they could.But in the U.S., our labor laws are broken. They exclude huge segments of workers from joining a union. And they favor the employer when those workers who can organize attempt to organize.Major employers know they can spend millions on union-busting consultants…use illegal tactics to delay the vote or delay recognizing the newly formed union…knowing they will only get a slap on the wrist.But more unions are talking about recognition strikes than at any point in the last 30 years. Our unions are seeing recognition strikes as a way for workers to form a union and bypass our broken labor laws. Reforming our labor laws is essential if we want workers to have family-sustaining wages, good benefits, stronger protections to stay safe on the job, greater racial and gender equity, and greater power and prosperity.There is a bill currently in the U.S. Senate called the Protecting the Right to Organize Act—or the PRO Act, for short—that will go a long way in strengthening workers’ ability to organize.But it is more than labor law reform legislation. It’s an economic stimulus. It’s civil rights legislation. It’s democracy reform.But right now, if it is brought to the floor for a vote, Senate Republicans will obstruct it through a filibuster – an old and outdated procedural rule.And Senate Republicans are threatening to do the same with legislation that will restore voting rights and make it easier for a whole bunch of people to cast their ballot and have a voice in our democracy.Suppressing the right to vote and limiting the right to organize have the same end…to sideline our voices, to limit our power.It is no accident these attacks are happening now. 

America’s workers campaigned and mobilized and got out the vote in 2020 so that we have a democratic majority in Congress and the most pro-union administration in our country’s history.

Former union staff are in key positions throughout the Biden administration.We have a union member as the head of the Department of Labor, who leads a task force President Biden launched last year on organizing and worker empowerment. And they just released a report which contains a wide range of concrete proposals that the administration has already done…or will do in the future…to make it easier for workers to organize unions and bargain collectively.The American labor movement is working hard to communicate the importance of election outcomes.And we will remind our members who delivered. The infrastructure bill President Biden signed into law will create hundreds of thousands of jobs...good, life-changing union jobs.It connects prevailing wages and high labor standards to the jobs created. And it creates a virtuous cycle…we grow our labor movement…we elect more pro-union leaders who are invested in workers and the long-term health of our economy.…we have the power to beat back right-wing attacks on our democracy…we reduce inequities and discrimination…and we elevate our communities.And we know that we need a strong and effective global labor movement to create a new model for all workers.

When we dedicate ourselves to growing power for workers through organizing on both sides of the Atlantic, we can create an economy where no one is left behind. Thank you.

40,Redmond: Philadelphia Labor Mobilizes for a Better Future,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-philadelphia-labor-mobilizes-better-future,1-31-2022,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond's remarks as prepared for the Philadelphia Labor Council, AFL-CIO COPE Conference:Thank you, Pat (Eiding), for that warm introduction, and for years of friendship.And I’d like to thank you and Jim (Gardler) and Ken (Washington) and the entire team at the Philadelphia Labor Council for your commitment and dedication to the labor movement and working families.The same goes for the secretary-treasurer of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO…a fellow S-T and a fellow Steelworker, brother Frank Snyder. Your grit and determination has made the labor movement stronger…in this great commonwealth of ours and across the country.And I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the vision and leadership of Pennsylvania AFL-CIO President Rick Bloomingdale. Rick, as we all know, is retiring in March. And as we all know, Pennsylvania’s working families have had no better advocate than Rick.And our democracy has had no better champion. We saw that in 2020 as the votes from the mail-in ballots still needed to be counted. Rick kept making the point that voters decide the outcome of elections. Not the courts. Not political appointees. But the voters. And Pennsylvania’s voters made their voices heard in record numbers. AndRick made sure the democratic processes we hold as sacred in this country…the right to a free and fair election…were honored.It has been an honor to work with you, Rick…as a brother…as a friend. And I wish you a happy, healthy and long retirement.[Pause]As you all know, in August of last year, our labor movement suffered a huge loss with the untimely death of Rich Trumka. Rich and I were personal friends for over 25 years. And I know he was a personal friend to many of you too.Rich was Pennsylvania to the core. He was born here. Raised here. Worked the mines here. And earned his degrees here. He loved this commonwealth. He loved this labor movement.He had faith in the future. And this labor council…this state federation…provided the greatest source of his optimism.And he had faith in Liz Shuler. Liz is smart, tough and the right person to lead the American labor movement at the right time. And I am honored to serve alongside her as the secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO.[Pause]Rich Trumka liked to say the American labor movement must be the tip of the spear in the fight against racism. And he was right. There is no better institution in America to lead the charge.And we need to be the tip of the spear on the urgent issues facing our nation today.Economic justice.Gender justice.Voting rights and strengthening democracy.Guaranteeing a path to citizenship for immigrants.All of these issues are critical to making sure that working people live a dignified life both inside and outside of the workplace.That we are able to exercise our rights AND have access to the best opportunities for ourselves and our families.Right now, working people are fed up. The pandemic has pulled back the curtain. Workers are rejecting jobs where they risk their health and safety for a poverty wage. Workers are striking and standing up for their rights.And young people especially are embracing unions as a vehicle to speak up at work.There’s an energy out there. We need to capture it.It’s critical for all of us to continue to organize...to keep building our capacity...and to keep engaging with our communities.We need to show all working people that the labor movement is for them.We need to do a better job connecting with women and young people and communities of color.We are having tough conversations on race and racial justice and equality through the AFL-CIO’s Task Force on Racial Justice.And we need to make sure our democracy empowers it too. Right now, we are facing serious attacks on voting rights and civil rights and worker rights. Voter suppression and gerrymandering and limiting our right to organize…these are dire issues.The goal is the same …to sideline our voices.We aren’t giving up on the John Lewis Freedom to Vote Act. And we are pushing the Senate to sideline the filibuster.Some senators are making the claim that changing the rules to pass these bills is some kind of moral affront. But the moral affront is that we need to pass these bills in the first place. We know why it’s so hard to pass voting rights. There are senators who want all the power and privilege for themselves. They want to limit our opportunity.One of those senators is vacating his seat this year. Pat Toomey has been called a lot of things, but pro-worker isn’t one of them. And now we have a golden opportunity to have TWO pro-union senators represent Pennsylvania’s working families.And we will. Because the American labor movement does not quit. We don’t give up. And we are NOT giving up on November!There is too much at stake.We are going to send Attorney General Josh Shapiro to Harrisburg…And we are going to flip the state senate and legislature.Now look, I have called Pennsylvania home for more than 20 years now. And one thing I have learned is that thePennsylvania labor movement knows how to mobilize and engage its members.We saw it in 2020 during one of the most challenging times in our nation’s history.And we’re going to see it again this year. All eyes will be on Philadelphia.And the work of the Philadelphia labor council is essential. You are a force for change…for working people…for your communities.The national AFL-CIO will make sure you have the resources you need to be a force for change…for working people…for your communities.So we can elect pro-worker candidates up and down the ballot…and pass the legislation and policies that matter to working people.We know elections have consequences.If you need an example, just look at the infrastructure bill President Biden signed into law. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs...good, life-changing union jobs…in the Mid-Atlantic and across the country.And you helped make this happen. You talked to your members and elected officials. You campaigned and mobilized and got out the vote in 2020 so that we have a democratic majority in Congress and the most pro-union administration in our country’s history.That is how we have these investments workers have been demanding for so long.This bill strengthens our supply chains...and Buy America rules to help stop the outsourcing of good union jobs.It connects prevailing wages and high labor standards to the jobs created, and I know this labor council will make sure those commitments are honored.Our work isn’t done. We need to keep pushing for the Build Back Better Act. The bill includes a key piece of the PRO Act so union-busting employers who violate our right to organize will be hit with real penalties.It cracks down on tax loopholes so corporations and the wealthy finally will pay a little more of their fair share.It makes huge investments in child care and elder care so more working families can get back to work.Major energy investments...more infrastructure investments…This bill is an investment in working people and the long-term health of our economy.We have an opportunity to build a better future for our children and our grandchildren.And we cannot let it pass us by.Make sure your members see you and hear you. Remind them that elections have consequences. Remind them who delivered for working people and our economy as we head toward 2022.And send leaders to Harrisburg and Washington who have the compassion and courage working people need and deserve.Remind them that there’s nothing we can’t do when we stand together.We are part of a powerful movement at a critical time.Let’s flex our muscle and build a Philadelphia…a Pennsylvania…and an America that works for all working people.Let’s keep going. Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Redmond
41,Shuler: Texas Labor Is Building an Equitable Future,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-texas-labor-building-equitable-future,1-20-2022,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks by video to the Texas AFL-CIO 2022 COPE Convention:Good morning. I’m Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO.I’m thrilled to join you for the 2022 COPE Convention–even if it is by video.Rick Levy, Leonard Aguilar and the Texas AFL-CIO team are doing outstanding work. Thanks to Beto O’Rourke for joining this convention.And most importantly, to the thousands of union leaders and activists who are growing the labor movement in the Lone Star State…standing up for voting rights and worker rights…thank you for your resilience and solidarity. I want to give a special congratulations to Rebecca Flores, Becky Moeller, and the late John Bland. All are tough-as-nails trailblazers who have earned their place in the Texas Labor Hall of Fame. And I’m sure our young workers are taking a page out of your playbook and learning from you, I’m so proud of the work they’re doing to lead the next generation of our labor movement thanks Y’ALL!We’ve been through so much together. We’ve lost friends and family...members of our labor community...including John [Bland], Walter [Umphrey], and my partner for 12 years, Rich Trumka.
 
We stand on their shoulders and we will keep building on their progress. And right now working people are hungry for change…we’re speaking up…taking risks…going on strike.Like the AFM members, musicians, on strike at the San Antonio Symphony. It’s about respect. Dignity. Balancing the scales that have been so tilted by corporate greed. In Beaumont, Steelworkers are enduring month 9 of the lockout at Exxon’s refinery and oil packaging plant. The Texas AFL-CIO has been there, every step of the way…hosting a holiday toy drive. Collecting food donations. Fundraising. 
 
And the Texas labor movement knows, it’s not just about our union members. It’s about the entire community. During the 2021 power crisis, when temperatures dropped, outdated infrastructure failed and families were left freezing in the dark. Through the state federation, union members delivered life-saving needs like drinkable water to thousands of homes. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is going to deliver long-overdue upgrades to the systems that keep us connected and our country running. It’s going to create good, union jobs. And we’re keeping our foot on the accelerator to get the Build Back Better Act over the finish line. Because it’s going to be the largest ever investment in clean energy.Texas is leading the way with the Climate Jobs Project…an ambitious and inspiring goal to create 1.1 million good, union jobs in wind and solar…because we know that the high paying jobs in oil and gas have provided a good living for working class families for generations— and we want to make sure the the next generation energy jobs of the future are high wage, family sustaining too. That’s how we build an equitable clean energy future…everyone included, and not balanced on the backs of working people with low road jobs. And of course, Build Back Better has investments in energy jobs…AND a key piece of the PRO Act, with first-of-their-kind penalties for employers who violate our right to organize.The right to vote for a union at work…to shape our working conditions and economic futures…is a fundamental part of a healthy democracy…just like voting rights at the ballot box. Both are under attack…and this is it. What we do right now will determine if we keep our democracy.Rick and the entire Texas Labor Movement…we know how hard you've been working to activate your members.
 
Together, we are mobilizing nationwide to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, the Freedom to Vote Act and to sideline the filibuster. At the same time, we’re standing up against the hundreds of anti-democracy laws moving through statehouses. Last summer, the Texas Democratic Delegation did everything in their power to block a dangerous voter suppression bill that would make it harder for working people and people of color to vote. When they left the state to break quorum…to prevent the bill from passing…you were right there alongside them… and we were proud to welcome them to the House of Labor in Washington. We are still linked, arm in arm…united. And through our solidarity, we can and we will reclaim our voting rights and our organizing rights. Democracy lives in action and it’s great to see the candidates participating in the debate today. 
 
That’s one exciting reason why you’re here today...to hear from the candidates and make informed choices. To elect representatives who will stand up for all working people.And the entire country sees the work you are doing, bit by bit, step by step, to turn the tide in  Texas. To stand up for the rights of immigrants…and secure a path to citizenship. To lift up all working people. Keep it up. Keep going. We are with you! And together, we are going to build a bold, dynamic, inclusive movement for the future. Thank you and have a great convention.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

42,Gebre: We Must Be Steadfast in our Solidarity to Fully Realize Dr. King’s Dream,https://aflcio.org/speeches/gebre-we-must-be-steadfast-our-solidarity-fully-realize-dr-kings-dream,1-17-2022,"Hi, I’m Tefere Gebre, executive vice president of the AFL-CIO.In my 27 years in the labor movement, Dr. King’s vision has inspired and propelled me forward.His words meant so much to me as a young political refugee and immigrant in a new country.As I look back on my first union job, I remember feeling immense hope for what solidarity can mean for every working person in this country, no matter who they are or where they were born.What is happening to working people today is the opposite of Dr. King’s vision and hope.More than 50 years after the Voting Rights Act was signed into law, efforts are underway across the country to strip communities of color of our right to vote.Immigrants continue to work in the shadows with no clear path to citizenship.And millions of people nationwide are working for poverty wages, in unsafe conditions.Our democracy is at risk.Our rights are in danger.Democracy and rights are like muscles and heart.If we don’t use them, they wither.But when we exercise our rights—our right to speak up, our right to organize, our right to vote—our democracy can grow stronger.Democracy means we stand together, as equals.There should be no “us vs them” in our movement.Our strength can be found in every corner of the country—in our federations’ members, home health care workers, mine workers, sanitation workers, doctors, actors, journalists and more.There is no real democracy when anyone who lives and works here is disenfranchised at the ballot box or at our workplaces.No matter where we are or what we do, being united is the only way that we can move forward.We must be steadfast in our solidarity.Only then can we fully realize Dr. King’s dream. I remain hopeful we can. Thank you.

43,Redmond: The Labor Movement Must Do What's Right  ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-labor-movement-must-do-whats-right,1-17-2022,"Good evening. I’m Fred Redmond, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO.Thank you for joining us this weekend as we celebrate the legacy of Dr. King.I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would be a leader of the national AFL-CIO.I am, at heart, still a regular guy—a Black kid from the south side of Chicago trying to navigate my way through life—working in the aluminum mill—getting involved in the Steelworkers local—and then leading it—and always trying to do the right thing for our members.That’s the key. To do what’s right. Whether it’s for an individual, a community or a country.To do what’s right. That’s our guiding light in the labor movement—our collective responsibility to make the world a better place.That’s what Dr. King worked to achieve in the civil rights movement. To do what’s right. That’s his legacy, and it’s the legacy we inherit.But legacies are not set in stone. They continue to evolve and take shape.And it’s our job to shape them. It’s our job—the ones who come after—to embody Dr. King’s words—his character—his vision—and apply them to our time.And right now we are living in a time of crisis.The pandemic continues to rage and disproportionately harm Black and Brown Americans.We are facing serious attacks on voting rights and civil rights and worker rights.And the fate of our democracy hangs in the balance.The labor movement needs to live and breathe Dr. King’s values now more than ever—to be a progressive force—to advance human rights—economic opportunity, equity and inclusion.The labor movement remains at the forefront—to carve a path—walk it and lead by example.For social justice—for racial justice—and in true solidarity for all working people.In order to realize our full potential, it is critical that the labor movement is strong, morally and financially.As secretary-treasurer, my job is to keep the federation on an even footing, now and in the future.The AFL-CIO has 12.5 million members. We have to make sure those hard-earned wages go toward the resources we need to fight the good fight for workers’ rights to make sure workers are safe on the job and to support workers who are taking collective action for a better tomorrow.That’s why Dr. King went to Memphis 54 years ago—to be with the sanitation workers on strike—and join them in solidarity.No matter how big or small, each organizing win improves the lives of workers—and makes their jobs safer and more secure.Each organizing win builds our capacity to improve our communities.Each organizing win gives us more leverage at the bargaining table—in the streets—and on Capitol Hill.To beat back racism in America in all its forms.To reverse inequality.To beat COVID-19 and protect the most vulnerable in our society.To beat back the constant attacks on our democracy and to make sure all of our people have access to the ballot box.That’s how we make meaningful progress for working people—and continue the fight in making America and the world a better place for all.That’s how we shape Dr. King’s legacy—and in the process, shape our own.

44,Shuler: The Labor Movement Is Committed to Racial Justice,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-labor-movement-committed-racial-justice,1-17-2022,"Today, we celebrate the life, the leadership, the vision of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.We reflect on how organized labor used our collective voices and actions within the civil rights movement, mobilized the historic March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and championed the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts.We recognize the work so many of you have done over the decades to stand up to racism in systems of justice and politics—our workplaces and economies.Through visionary clarity, working people of color have taken the AFL-CIO to task, and made the labor movement stronger.And this is my promise to you as president—with Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond and Executive Vice President Tefere Gebre as my partners—the AFL-CIO is committed to racial justice.We are speaking the truth, including about ourselves—having difficult conversations and pushing beyond our comfort zones.We are looking at everything we do through a lens of racial justice and racial equity.And we know we have more work to do to honor and build upon the work you’ve already done.Movements are happening around us.Black Lives Matter, Say their Names, demanding justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and so many more.The Me Too movement—Tarana Burke founded the Me Too movement with two words, and she inspired a nationwide response to stand up against the abuse of power.She gets it. She said it’s about “labor rights and protecting workers. That point can’t be over-emphasized.”And the climate protests we’re seeing—we have to learn from these movements and the rising generation leading them with their passion and creativity.We want to be nimble, responsive and relevant.We want those young people to see us as a uniting force for transformation and progress.Gen Z and Millennials aren’t fluent in labor jargon—most have never even been to a bargaining table—and most probably don’t even know what a pension is.But they believe in organizing—in the power of collective action.We can connect movements, grow collaboration, and build momentum, together.Our battles are the same, our dreams for the future are the same, and we will rise together because of our unity of purpose, our shared commitment to an equitable future for everyone.The labor movement and the racial justice movement stand together, arm in arm.Because the labor movement is not some narrow, outside interest group. We are an intersectional movement.And the path forward for racial justice and gender equity—for environmental justice for communities of color—for young people who are hungry to change the structural barriers that built the unequal world they inherited—runs through the labor movement.The labor movement can be the most powerful vehicle for progress in our country— only if we are joined together, the most diverse and inclusive movement in history.Dr. King himself demanded this inclusivity from us when he spoke to the 1961 AFL-CIO convention, he challenged us when he said, “Together, we can be architects of democracy.”We are bringing together movements and people of all backgrounds:
—to grow political participation for all people;
—to expand economic power for all people;
—to make democracy work for all people.That’s the critical point I want to make about democracy in America.Unless we overcome the racial and ethnic barriers to full participation in civil society—barriers that are the painful reality of systemic racism—this is not a democracy at all.When we fight for Democracy, we fight for voting rights at the ballot box.And we fight for working people having a union at work to shape our working conditions and economic futures.Democracy is always a work in progress.And the progress we celebrate is because those who have been cut out or marginalized, have nevertheless fought on—demanded their right to a voice, to a say in shaping this country.But after so many attacks by the wealthy and powerful, we’ve reached a critical moment for our democracy.So we are going to leverage the full might of our movement.The labor movement is all in.We are standing up to the corporate-driven attacks that show up in the form of racist voter suppression and union busting.We will do everything in our power to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, immigration reform to guarantee a path to citizenship.United and through solidarity, we can and we will reclaim our organizing rights.Dr. King understood this intersectionality well. When he spoke to AFSCME sanitation workers on strike in Memphis he said, “Along with wages and all of the other securities that you are struggling for, you are also struggling for the right to organize and be recognized.”This is an important moment to take up Dr. King’s statement of our intersectionality across our movements.Americans see unions as an answer like never before, young workers see the best hope for progress is through collective voice and action.Today, across industries, working people are demanding more from their bosses at the bargaining table, they are taking risks, walking out of jobs, withholding their labor—and leveraging the power of strikes here and all over the world.Working people are standing up.Better wages. Safer conditions.Organizing in new industries.Leading breakthroughs at long-standing corporations and institutions.And we are going to make sure working people win.We are taking on Amazon.We are going back to Bessemer where the workforce is overwhelmingly people of color.This is absolutely a racial justice issue.And with commitments from so many affiliates—it’s an inspiring example of solidarity.Today, we reflect on the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.But it is about so much more than one man or one cause.It’s about him, her, them. All of us.And as a movement, 12.5 million people and growing—57 unions strong—with the most diverse leadership team in AFL-CIO history—this is our year to make the most progress yet for every working person in this country.Thank you.

45,Redmond: Diversity Is the Cornerstone to Democracy,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-diversity-cornerstone-democracy,1-13-2022,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks as prepared, virtually, to the National Black Law Students Association:Thank you, for that warm introduction Nick [Hall]. Hello, everyone, I’m Fred Redmond, secretary-treasurer at the AFL-CIO. We are 57 unions strong with nearly 13 million working people from every kind of background working in every kind of job. 

Thanks to Sidnee McDonald, NBLSA National Director of Career and Professional Development, and Craig Becker, AFL-CIO General Counsel, for their leadership putting this program togetherAnd I want to recognize the amazing leadership of Simone Yhap, Chair of the National Black Law Students Association.I want to recognize all of you.NBLSA is impressive. Not just because you’re one of the largest student-run organizations in the country. Not just because you have chapters at every major law school. But because of your mission. Culturally responsible. Black law students who are going to change the legal community.Now look, you’re already on your way to doing that.Because right now, when a Black person walks into a courtroom, what is the chance the judge or the defense attorney or the prosecuting attorney looks like them? Slim at best. There are some 1.3 million licensed attorneys in the United States…about 5% are Black, 88% are white. Yet Blacks make up 13% of the American population. Whites 60%. What effect does this underrepresentation have not only on an individual’s day in court but on our criminal justice system?
 
What effect does this underrepresentation have on the legislation that moves through our courthouses and statehouses and on Capitol Hill?
 
What effect does this underrepresentation have on the regulations staff attorneys research and draft and revise and implement?
 
Many of the laws that impact whole communities are written and considered and voted upon without the diversity of thought…without the diversity of perspective.
 
Diversity is the cornerstone of democracy. Without it, it’s not a democracy at all. 
 
And I’m not talking about laws meant to limit our power and limit our voice. 
 
Voter suppression laws. 
 
Gerrymandering and redistricting laws. 
 
Right to work laws. 
 
Laws intended to discriminate…to criminalize based on the color of our skin or where we live or who we choose to love. 
 
Laws intended to confine power and wealth in the hands of the few.
 
I’m talking about the laws and regulations that move through our system designed with good intentions, for the best outcomes…but because there isn’t a diversity of minds and lived experiences, these laws and regulations miss the mark. Or have unequal or unintended outcomes for whole communities.
 
Laws and regulations unwittingly amplify discrimination by using data and algorithms where historical discrimination and implicit bias are baked in. These systems decide who is qualified for a job…or who can buy a home and where.
 
It’s like we have gone from a version of Jim Crow to a version of James Crow.
 
This is what some 6 million Black people learned when they migrated north seeking opportunity in the Great Migration. 
 
My parents were part of it.
 
They left the oppressive laws and regulations in the segregated South when they moved to Chicago in 1958.
 
But what really happened is they went from overt segregation in the South to covert segregation in the North. 
 
Where deed restrictions meant white homeowners couldn’t sell their home to Black people, even if they wanted to.
 
Where red-lining was policy. The government would not back mortgages in Black neighborhoods. 
 
Blacks could not get a mortgage, build generational wealth, live a solid middle-class life. 
 
The Fair Housing Act changed that…made it unlawful to discriminate in the terms or conditions or privileges of a home sale. 
 
Everything we claim as progress was gained through incremental steps.
 
We need to preserve our victories and beat back new attacks. And the labor movement is the single most effective force for progress in this country.Wages and benefits. Safety and health. Collective bargaining agreements. The ability  to put food on the table, to have time to take care of our loved ones, and retire with dignity.Good and stable jobs are key to good and stable communities.Of course, we are products of our society. And unions are no different.In fact, when the AFL and CIO merged in 1955, Black workers were largely shut out of craft unions. The skilled trades. Some of the unions had clauses in their constitutions excluding non-whites. Some local unions were segregated.The labor movement evolved. How? With Black trade unions. With Black union leadership. The full scope and range of diversity and perspective.The labor movement built the Black middle class. In auto factories and steel plants. We turned bad jobs into good careers. And today, the most urgent racial and social justice issues run right through the labor movement.Economic justice. Gender justice. Voting rights and strengthening democracy.Guaranteeing a path to citizenship for immigrants.All of these issues are critical to making sure that working people live a dignified life both inside and outside of the workplace. That we have access to the best opportunities for ourselves and our families.So what does this have to do with you? The ULA started this relationship as part of our effort to diversify the labor bar. To attract good lawyers willing to make a difference in our society…and in our movement.We need you to use your skills, passion and knowledge to level the playing field and make sure that everyone, no matter who they are, can have a good life.And I suspect that is why many of you chose to go to law school. To help make this country more fair…to stamp out inequality and injustice….to lend the voiceless a voice.There is always a place for you in the labor movement. Our doors are wide open. I’m looking at this crowd right now. I can’t wait to see who among you is going to rise to the challenge.  Thank you.

46,Shuler: Everyone Should Have Clean Drinking Water,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-everyone-should-have-clean-drinking-water,12-16-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler joined Vice President Kamala Harris, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan and National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy to announce the Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan. President Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared:Hello everyone. It’s so great to be here today with my partners, NABTU President Sean McGarvey, UA President Mark McManus, LiUNA President Terry O’Sullivan, Ironworkers President Eric Dean and AFSCME President Lee Saunders. And allies like Nsedu Witherspoon with the Children’s Environmental Health Network.And we are so thrilled to welcome Vice President Harris, National climate advisor Gina McCarthy and EPA Administrator (Michael) Regan to the House of Labor.This administration talks like it’s pro-union.This administration acts like it’s pro-union.Because this administration is the most worker, pro-union administration in U.S. history!While others promised infrastructure, the Biden-Harris administration delivered.The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is going to upgrade the systems that connect us and make America run.It’s going to create jobs.Good, union jobs.And together, we will make sure our progress is equitable.Nowhere in the United States should drinking from the tap be a health hazard.But there is a long, terrible history of using lead pipes in low-income communities, and communities of color.Being Black should not be a greater risk factor for lead poisoning in the United States.But this is one of the literal toxic effects of systemic racism.And we will leverage the full might of the labor movement, in collaboration with the EPA and the Department of Labor, to replace lead pipes all across this country.American-made with high labor standards with PLAs and Davis Bacon protections.Clean water for everyone is economic justice, racial justice, environmental justice.Union members were the earliest and loudest voices about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan.Our unions have been on the front lines of the response.And we are going to lead the transformation for clean drinking water for everyone now.At every regional hub, union expertise, union skills, and union jobs will be there.People who live in impacted communities will have a clear pathway to access opportunities for high-wage, union jobs through apprenticeships and apprenticeship readiness programs.Growing good jobs locally is how we make sure these are long-term investments in communities that need it most.Nothing is more life-changing than the power of a good, union job.The labor movement, working with the most pro-union administration, will move our country forward.This is about the future. A livable planet. Equity. Justice.This is how we build back better—better than it is or ever was.And we build back better with unions!It is now my pleasure to introduce Laura Jackson, a Washington, DC resident who has been fighting to replace lead pipes here in the District for years—she can speak first-hand as to how important this initiative is.

47,Redmond: Labor Educators Deepen Our Knowledge,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-labor-educators-deepen-our-knowledge,12-7-2021,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks as prepared to the United Association of Labor Educators midyear conference:Thank you, Cheryl (Coney) and thank you all for being here.UALE officers, including your president Mary Bellman, are building a strong association. The AFL-CIO is proud to be a member and have our leadership development coordinator Kate Shaughnessy on the executive board.You all have a huge impact on the future of the American labor movement.Labor educators are the bridge between the House of Labor as an institution and working people. You help working people—union leaders, union staff—organizers, activists, rank-and-file—make sense of the changing economic, social and political landscape. You deepen our knowledge. You give us the skills to understand and communicate the “why,” which leads us to take action.And this work has never been more important.We are bombarded by information. In the news. On social media. Facts and propaganda. Truths and half-truths and even some straight up lies. Labor educators lend us the skills so we can cut through the noise.This isn’t easy work. But it’s rewarding work. I know this first hand.I enjoy talking to workers. I could do it all day. But here’s the thing, we need to listen too. We need to hear the stories—without judgment—and share our own.That’s how we connect with workers—all workers—all colors, ages, genders, creeds—immigrant workers and native workers.And once we make that connection, we can show the difference a union can make in their lives—and how the labor movement is the best and most powerful force for economic and social and racial justice.Because a union job is so much more than a job.It’s a career. It gives a sense of pride—a high quality of life—good health care and the ability to retire with dignity.And the sense of belonging in a broader movement of working people who are all working toward the greater good.Who doesn’t want that? It’s our job to help workers join or form a union. No matter how big or small, each organizing win improves the lives of workers—better wages and benefits, access to health care—and makes their jobs safer and more secure.But our job isn’t done when a first contract is ratified. The greater challenge is unionizing workers.What do I mean by that? It’s member engagement. It’s internal organizing. It’s educating and training stewards and union leaders and community partners to communicate the core values of the labor movement. To engage members. To show the value the union brings to their lives.Mother Jones once said that we should sit down and read and educate ourselves for the coming conflicts. I agree. We have a rich history. I’m fascinated by it. I enjoy it. And knowing our labor history—our civil rights history—and connecting it to our movement today can help us be better prepared for the coming conflicts. And allow us to fight harder and smarter.Right now, working people are fed up. The pandemic has pulled back the curtain. Workers want to get paid a fair wage. Workers are rejecting jobs where they risk their health and safety for a poverty wage.Workers across America are striking and standing up for their rights. And young people especially are seeing unions as a vehicle to voice displeasure with employers.There’s an energy out there. We need to capture it.We need to show all working people that the labor movement is for everyone.We need to do a better job connecting with women and young people and communities of color.Labor educators have helped us have these tough conversations on race and racial justice and equality—through the AFL-CIO’s Commission on Racial and Economic Justice.You have helped us engage our members and our communities—and have held training with our leadership to be more inclusive.And all of you as educators will continue to play a huge role in this important work.You see, you focus the lens so we can see the world more clearly—together.Our collective knowledge—our collective experience—is our power.Now look, we don’t have all of the answers—to pretend we do would be foolish. So we need the best ideas—the best strategies—the most effective tools to grow the labor movement—and tilt the power dynamics in this country toward working people.The possibilities of organized labor are endless. The labor movement is open to everyone. What other group or institution can say that? We accept everybody. And we need everybody. Because diversity is our greatest strength. And an educated and engaged membership is our most powerful weapon. But all workers must play a role in pushing our labor movement forward.Because the attacks on our democracy are real—and the labor movement needs to be at the forefront—to combat voter suppression and the anti-worker laws designed to silence us.The labor movement has always fought hard.Labor educators help us fight smart.You are a critical force to change unions and communities—to keep us unified—and better prepared for the coming conflicts.So let’s be bold. Let’s go for it. Let’s be the labor movement we have always aspired to be.Thank you so much and for the work you do. I’m happy to take some questions.

48,Shuler: The Labor Movement Chooses Democracy ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-labor-movement-chooses-democracy,12-7-2021,"Secretary of Labor Martin J. Walsh and AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler, together with representatives of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and the Solidarity Center highlighted the role of worker voice and worker rights as fundamental components of democracy in the United States and globally at an official U.S. Summit for Democracy side event. President Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared:Hello everyone, I’m Liz Shuler, President of the AFL-CIO.Thank you. It’s an honor to be here with so many global leaders and advocates, and especially my friend Secretary Walsh and Deputy Undersecretary Thea Lee. And I want to thank you, and the entire Biden-Harris administration for hosting this summit and for making sure the voices of workers are part of the conversation.This is the most pro-union administration in U.S. history. And it’s leading at a critical moment.The ongoing global spread of COVID-19 has made it clear how very connected we are.And through those connections, we have to wonder: What values will spread to define and shape the post-pandemic world?It seems we have two clear choices.On the one hand, we have what the journalist Anne Applebaum calls “Autocracy Incorporated”: a global economic system linked and supported by structural violence and a rigged global financial system.And it’s not just national autocrats. It’s members of corporate c-suites. They are enabled through big data and surveillance tech; misinformation on social platforms and state owned media. They use forced and exploited labor. They treat working people like robots.But on the other hand—the other choice we have is democracy: the power for people to have a say at the ballot box.And a say in our economic futures and working conditions by standing together in unions.This summit is an opportunity to recommit to democracy—in our workplaces and in our societies—all across the world.In the United States, the labor movement is working to reclaim bargaining rights, and expand voting rights. Secure a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants in a shadow economy. Fight for racial and gender justice.And look what’s happening: right now, across industries throughout the U.S., working people are taking risks, walking out of jobs, going on strike.We are winning better pay, benefits and rejecting the two-tier systems where younger workers get a substandard deal.We are growing a bold, inclusive global labor movement. We are going to build power and organize with workers across borders, bring people in from the margins of the informal economy, reclaim our humanity from platform companies and gig jobs, end workplace discrimination and grow economic power for women and people of color.Economic opportunity, equity and inclusion depend on freedom of association and the labor movement.And strengthening democracies depends on social dialogue, worker-centered policies and social protection.In Myanmar, for example, trade unions have overwhelmingly led the fight for democracy. In Tunisia, it was trade unions who brokered a peaceful path to democracy.Threats to democracy globally go hand-in-hand with threats to workers’ fundamental rights—to freedom of association and collective bargaining.Workers and union leaders are among the first who are targeted in repressive campaigns against democracy.Like our brother Sawit Kaewvarn in Thailand, who is currently facing years in prison for his role in organizing a railway safety campaign.We stand with all workers—everywhere—who are on the frontlines of democracy in their workplaces and their countries.And that’s why the AFL-CIO looks forward to partnering with government partners on the M-POWER initiative, which will build on the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment by adding a global component that supports worker organizations in countries where worker rights and democracy are threatened.Our movement is one of the most powerful counterforces to Autocracy 4.0.Our adversaries may be networked—but work connects all of us—and we are using our powerful connections to lift up all working people—in the U.S. and globally.We have a choice. And the labor movement chooses democracy. Thank you.

49,Redmond to Steelworkers: We Can Overcome Any Challenge,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-steelworkers-we-can-overcome-any-challenge,12-6-2021,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks as prepared to the United Steelworkers District 12 conference:Thank you, Brother Gaylan (Prescott) for that kind introduction and for your leadership of this great district.And thank you Jim (Kilborn) and the entire District 12 delegates and staff for your commitment and dedication to our great union and working families.To Larry Brown for your incredible work for the working people of Washington. And I also want to thank Secretary-Treasurer (John) Shinn, brother Ken (Neumann) and sister Roxanne (Brown) and the entire executive team for your steadfast leadership of the greatest union in the world.It has been the honor of my life to serve as Vice President of the greatest union in the world—the United Steelworkers. Once a steelworker, you will always be a steelworker.On August 5 of this year, our labor movement suffered a huge loss with the untimely death of our leader Rich Trumka, the president of the national AFL-CIO. Rich and I were personal friends for over 25 years.The secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, Liz Shuler, was moved up by the board to the position of president to replace Rich Trumka.Liz is smart, tough and the right person to lead the American labor movement at this time. And the first woman to lead the American labor movement.And I was honored that the executive board of the AFL-CIO appointed me as the new secretary-treasurer of the national AFL-CIO.I am so thrilled to be here with you today.Brother Gaylan and I got our start at Reynolds aluminum. We both know first hand the life-changing power of a good union job.And I suspect you do too.We know a union job is so much more than a job.It’s a career. It gives a sense of pride—a high quality of life—good health care and the ability to retire with dignity.And the sense of belonging in a broader movement of working people who are all working toward the greater good.Steelworkers are making it happen. Organizing the workers who care for our veterans in Oregon. Oil workers in Washington. Chemical workers in Colorado. Food delivery workers and charter school teachers in California.No matter how big or small, each organizing win improves the lives of workers—and makes their jobs safer and more secure.The health and safety of workers is one of our primary responsibilities.The pandemic has pulled back the curtain. Workers in every sector are finding out who has their backs—who is fighting for justice, fairness and equality—fighting to keep them safe on the job. And it’s not the corporations.It’s us—the labor movement. We have been there for workers every step of the way—in the most challenging environment we have ever faced.And everyone in this room stepped up in a big way—all hands on deck—through our strength and solidarity.We know that’s how we can overcome any challenge before us.No group of workers has felt the pandemic more specifically—more personally—than our health care workers. They work long hours—under extreme stress and pressure—putting themselves in harm’s way to care for others.Now look, half a million workers have left health care since the beginning of the pandemic.And who can blame them? They’re exhausted. Burned out. Underappreciated. Done.And when health care workers are overworked, patients suffer.And yet, corporations keep making cuts—keep squeezing—keep trying to get blood from a stone. Keep putting profits over people.Look no further than Kaiser. In the second quarter of this year, it raked in 2 billion dollars. Billion with a B. But instead of treating our health care workers like the heroes they are—Kaiser’s initial proposal was an insult.We are all extremely proud of our Local 7600. Under the leadership of Michael Bennett and Norberto, they organized their members, built a strong CAT team and fought a fight that showed Kaiser the type of union we are.But Kaiser picked the wrong fight with the wrong union!The Steelworkers of District 12 organized—you mobilized—you joined together with our allies and partners—you were ready to strike.And this week, Kaiser workers will vote on a new contract—with industry-leading wages and benefits—career training opportunities—better health and safety standards—and wage equity for our brothers and sisters in Local 7600.You are heroes! And our union stood up to make sure you get respected like the heroes you are!All across the country right now workers are rising up. Mobilizing and striking for a better tomorrow. And we are winning!We have the leverage and we need to use it.It’s critical for all of us to continue to organize—to keep building our capacity—and to keep engaging with our communities.This is especially important as we enter national bargaining for the oil sector.Our solidarity will see us through and we will get the fair contracts our members deserve.And life-changing first contracts for our future members.The historic bipartisan infrastructure bill that President Biden just signed into law will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the Western United States—good union jobs. Finally!And the Steelworkers helped make this happen. You turned out across the country on the “We Supply America” bus tour. You talked to your members and elected officials. You campaigned and got out the vote in 2020 so that we have a pro-worker administrationthe most pro union administration in our country’s history—a democratic majority in Congress—in place to deliver these investments that workers have been demanding for so long.This bill strengthens our supply chains—critical for our cement, steel and aluminum sectors.The bill strengthens Buy America rules to help stop the outsourcing of good union jobs—that helps our members and strengthens our national security.It connects prevailing wages and high labor standards to the jobs created, and I know District 12 will make sure those commitments are honored.And we need to keep pushing for the Build Back Better Act.The bill includes a key piece of the PRO Act so union-busting employers who violate our right to organize will be hit with real penalties.The bill cracks down on tax loopholes so the super-rich and corporations finally will pay a little more of their fair share.It makes huge investments in child care and elder care so more working families can get back to work.Major energy investments—this bill is an investment in working people and the long-term health of our economy.This is our opportunity to build a better future for our children and our grandchildren.We cannot let this opportunity pass us by.Make sure your members see you and hear you.Remind them that elections have consequences.Remind them who delivered for working people and our economy as we head toward 2022.Remind them that there’s nothing we can’t do when we stand together.We’re part of a powerful movement at a historic time.Now let’s build an America that works for all working people.Thank you, District 12.I appreciate each and every one of you and the work you do. Keep going and stay strong.

50,Shuler: Kansas Labor Is with Working People Every Step of the Way,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-kansas-labor-working-people-every-step-way,11-18-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler's remarks recorded for the Kansas AFL-CIO Convention:Hello Kansas! I am honored to be with you—even though it’s by video.Thank you so much Andy (Sanchez), Tony (Spicer), John (Nave) and the entire state fed team for your hard work and dedication.Through the worst—ongoing—public health crisis in a century, Kansas labor keeps stepping up.To all of you: thank you for your resilience and solidarity.I’ve been walking the picket lines over the last month, and what I’m seeing is inspiring.We have each other’s back.Through thick and thin.In rain and hail and high winds, we are out there holding down the line.And we are showing the country that, through the power of our unions, we can stand up for better pay and safer working conditions—and we can win.Nurses in Overland Park.Steel workers at the Bradken components facility in Atchison.BCTGM members at Frito-Lay in Topeka.We refuse to go back to how things were before the pandemic.But some of these corporations are trying to drag us back 100 years.Frito-Lay had these what they called, “suicide shifts,” where you work eight hours—then forced to work four more hours—then you’re called in four hours early for your next shift.The Kansas AFL-CIO was right there, every step of the way—you even held a PRO Act rally from the strike line.And you’re standing strong with the UAW members on strike now against John Deere.The entire labor movement and our community partners are leveraging our power to help them win.Governor (Laura) Kelly has been such a steadfast pro-worker ally in Kansas.Her leadership saved the state from the brink of bankruptcy.She put the state back on solid financial footing so it could fund schools and the programs working people want.And while we’ve heard so much talk over the years about infrastructure, the Biden–Harris administration, and pro-worker champions like Congresswoman (Sharice) Davids, delivered.The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will bring $3.8 billion dollars to Kansas.Billion with a B.Investment in roads and railGovernor Kelly’s State Transportation Plan, combined with these investments, positions Kansas to be a national transportation leader.Kansas labor will repair bridges with American-made steel and iron.With prevailing wages and high labor standards. Building and construction industries will keep growing.Rural broadband will close the digital divide.Manufacturing jobs will return home, reviving the Aerospace economy in Wichita.And wind, solar, zero-emission transit, those clean energy sectors will keep booming and with the labor standards attached to these investments.Union job training and apprenticeship programs will be the place that workers come to find new opportunities and bring in a whole new generation to the labor movement.All of it adds up to a more competitive America, with workers—not corporations and hedge fund managers, but workers—at the center.And good, union jobs in Kansas and all across America.But we’re not done. Please keep raising your voices for Congress to pass the Build Back Better Act.It’s a game-changer.It includes a key piece of the PRO Act, with first-of-their-kind penalties for employers who violate our right to organize. So REAL consequences for breaking the law.Plus investment in care infrastructure—child care, elder care, care for the differently abled—the critical infrastructure people need to be able to go to work.Millions of people—mostly women—were sidelined by the pandemic to shoulder care responsibilities.And right now, one in four women say they can’t go back to work because they still don’t have childcare.So keep the pressure on.Because the progress we make—as one united movement—lifts up every working person in this country.That’s why we do this.Keep going. Keep up the great work. I know you will and that’s why I am so hopeful for the future.Thank you Kansas labor and have a great convention!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
51,Shuler: Metro Washington Is a Model for Worker Engagement,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-metro-washington-model-worker-engagement,11-12-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the Metropolitan Washington Council:Thank you, George (Farenthold).Thank you to our labor allies for being here: Executive (of Prince George's County) Angela Alsobrooks, Congressman (Anthony) Brown, Father (Brian) Jordan, Mayor (Muriel) Bowser, and White House Director of Labor Engagement, Erika Dinkel-Smith.That was such a beautiful reflection about three incredible labor leaders.We are moving fast—pushing forward—but it’s important to slow down and acknowledge: We’ve been through so much together—as a movement—as a country.We’ve lost friends and family, members of our labor community—including Liz, Andrew, and my partner for 12 years, Rich Trumka.When I think of Rich I think of his roots in the Mineworkers and Pennsylvania.He always talked about it—how the bosses at the mines thought they could deny workers their rights.Rich led the Pittston strike—he used the union to put power behind workers’ voices—and he wanted every working person, on every job, to have that power of a union too.And right now working people are hungry for change—they’re speaking up—taking risks—going on strike.The labor movement is leading a national reckoning.I’ve been visiting those picket lines—and everywhere I go the thing that stands out the most is how working people are truly in it together. They are bonded by the struggle and that solidarity is powerful. It makes me emotional!Through thick and thin—in rain and hail and high winds—they’re out there holding down the line.As we continue to work through our grief and weather the challenges of this ongoing pandemic, we are rising to meet this moment.This council plays a special role, through local activism and organizing—and a presence on the national stage.You are a model for engagement, always there—at every rally, each table.You are woven into the fabric of the nation's capital community. And you’ve made incredible progress:Hazard pay and workplace protections for grocery workers.In Anne Arundel, prevailing wages for construction workers.Collective bargaining agreements at the Kennedy Center and Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.And too many organizing breakthroughs to name. It takes teamwork and leadership.And speaking of leadership—Dyana (Forester), where are you? Will you wave, please?Everyone: This is what a strong labor leader looks like.Dyana and Robert (Hollingsworth) and the entire team: Thank you for your hard work moving the council forward.Finally, congratulations to tonight’s awardees. You are examples for thinking big and innovating.That’s our future. We’re building a bold, inclusive and dynamic movement.So keep going. Those we love and lost will be with us every step of the way.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
52,Shuler at COP26: We Cannot Leave Workers Behind,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-cop26-we-cannot-leave-workers-behind,11-10-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared at an event on just transition at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26):I’m Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, a federation of 57 national and international unions representing nearly 13 million working people.We are talking about a “just transition” for working people as we address the climate crisis—but here is the challenge of building a “just transition:”We’ve never seen one before.We’ve seen transitions for short-term gain.We’ve seen transitions that have created enormous wealth for a few, and widespread hardship for working people.We don’t want to repeat the bad policy choices of the past that left communities stranded.Free trade, deregulation, outsourcing, precarious work, the rise of the gig economy—you name it—working people have been short-changed.It can’t be like that in the fight against climate change—the stakes are too high.The urgency of this moment demands we learn from that past.No, we haven’t seen a Just Transition before, but we can envision it!Each person, every place included.High road, good, union jobs for everyone.Environmental protection.Progress for racial justice. Gender equity.A Just Transition to a sustainable, equitable future means solidarity.That all working people have a voice.At work.In our political processes.In climate outcomes.Unions are the vehicle for worker voice. For worker power.We belong at every table where climate decisions are made.The Paris Agreement calls for a Just Transition because worker voices—at those tables—demanded it through our unions.And just a few days ago, the U.S. and many other governments signed a Just Transition pledge—a welcome step that we now need to make real with actions on the ground, not just words on paper.The values of the ILO in international climate policy, development and finance are more important now than ever.Without those values, it’s just a transition.We need a Just Transition—with labor rights and union growth.No one left behind.Think about this:There’s a difference between a coal company and a coal community.Look at Alabama.Warrior Met, a company driven by corporate greed, has denied miners a fair share of the value those workers create.Miners have been on strike since April—7 months.That injustice and inequity hurts the entire community.Children and teachers—nurses and social workers.And before those communities suffer the economic impacts of displacement, they need support.We applaud President Biden's Interagency working group on coal communities.Labor is at that table, and it makes a difference.The AFL-CIO will continue to push for full funding of these investments.Wage replacement and health care for those laid off.A bridge to a pension.Job training programs that give people the choice to stay and prosper in their communities.We need ongoing social dialogue and stakeholder engagement.Economic strategies that center on working people.And we need to guarantee our rights to stand together in trade unions—so we can make sure clean energy jobs are good jobs, with benefits and retirement security.Work connects all of us.And every part, every link, every step of the supply and value chains should also include the highest labor standards.Offshore wind, solar, electric vehicles and more—no exceptions—every clean energy sector—each company—we’re calling on you.Supply family-supporting union jobs NOW.We are going to continue to build a broad and inclusive coalition for political momentum.Connecting marginalized communities, people of color, women, and working people in every industry.We are growing a bold, inclusive labor movement to meet this moment.To leverage our power with our governments.To create more balance in the economy.To bring people in from the margins of the informal economy.We can create a fair, sustainable future—through solidarity.And we are determined to keep raising our voices through our unions.That’s how we will make the Just Transition a reality.Thank you.

53,Shuler to Kentucky: American Innovation Is Union-Made,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-kentucky-american-innovation-union-made,11-8-2021,"Good morning Kentucky Labor! I’m excited to be with you—I wish I could be there in person—but I’m glad that at least I can be in the room with you virtually. I just want to thank Bill (Londrigan) for his leadership—Bill, you’ve done an incredible job keeping the Kentucky labor movement focused and moving forward through challenging times, and you and Jeff (Wiggins), Liles (Taylor)—the entire team—thank you for your hard work and dedication.And I was able to listen in to those beautiful commemorations of John Sweeney and Rich Trumka—thank you so much for those.We will never, ever forget them, their contributions, and all the members who've died through this past year and a half.We’ve been through so much together, as a labor movement—as a country—so thank you for your resilience, support and solidarity.As we continue to work through our grief and weather the challenges of this ongoing pandemic...we are rising to meet this moment, and organize for the future.This is our time to be bold, take risks, and grow.Everything is lined up:We have the Biden administration and pro-worker champions like Congressman Yarmuth delivering for working people—with this infrastructure package that just passed—it’s what we’ve been fighting for for decades.And we have working people out there, standing up, hungry for structural change. The labor movement is leading a national reckoning—and the public is with us. Approval ratings are at a 50 year high.People are speaking out and taking risks at work and in the streets—across party lines—nearly 75 percent of voters support the strikes—Democrats AND Republicans agree people should be able to join together to win their fair share.Like UFCW Local 23-D distillery workers at Heaven Hill, who were on the picket lines for six weeks—and through their tenacity and solidarity, earned a better contract. Even Chipotle workers in Lexington walked out because of unfair conditions.My brother, UMWA president Cecil (Roberts) is here—but just a few days ago, he was arrested on Wall Street.That’s because miners at Warrior Met in Alabama have sacrificed, made concessions, but the company’s Wall Street hedge fund owners won’t negotiate a fair contract. Those Miners have been on strike since April.Cecil will tell you more about it, but I want to recognize the tremendous personal sacrifice every working person on strike right now in this country is making.No one wants to go on strike. We hold the line because this pandemic has changed us—we believe in a future where every working person has access to a good, union job—and we are never, ever going back to how it was.It’s been a long time coming.A couple years ago, CWA went on strike against AT&T across the South, in Kentucky and 8 other states to win a fair contract.Teachers in Kentucky stood up against attacks on pensions and were facing big budget cuts.The anti-union former governor called those educators “selfish” and “thugs.”Well. The entire Kentucky labor movement organized. Door knocked. Phone banked. Conversation after conversion.And now, we call Jacqueline Coleman—an educator, our sister, member of the Kentucky Education Association—Madam Lieutenant Governor.We call Governor Andy Beshear Kentucky’s pro-worker champion.His leadership is such a bright spot for Kentucky’s working families.When COVID hit, he enacted worker safety protections—made sure low-income students had resources to learn—and kept families who were facing the threat of eviction safe in their homes.And when working people were looking for help and hope, Kentucky labor stepped up.You helped unemployed workers navigate the unemployment insurance system—regardless if they were union members or not.And when those life-saving benefits were about to expire, you showed up outside Mitch McConnell’s office and made him hear your support for the HEROES Act loud and clear.And you demanded a life-line for working people with the American Rescue Plan.Congressman John Yarmuth’s name is at the top of that transformative piece of legislation.He’s probably not on yet, but Representative Yarmuth—thank you. You’ve been a tireless champion for the working people of Kentucky.We’re going to miss you when you retire next year—but the work you’ve done to pass historic relief—and now, game-changing investments—will have an impact not just now but for generations to come.This bipartisan Infrastructure bill that was just passed on Friday is a huge victory for working people.The Infrastructure Report Card gave Kentucky infrastructure a C- (the country as a whole is also a C-). Because of decades of neglect and decline. Now, finally, we can get these long-overdue investments moving at the community level, so we can thrive. And compete.Fixing lead pipes so we can have clean water. Building out high-speed internet.Roads and bridges. Public transit.Investment in passenger rail. Airport upgrades.Electric Vehicle charging stations. Upgrading our electricity grid. And climate resilience.All of it means jobs—across industries. For the building trades. Our transportation unions. And jobs throughout the manufacturing supply chain.We’re going to make sure these investments aren’t just creating any jobs…but GOOD, union jobs in Kentucky.It’s exciting to finally have a win under our belts. And we are on the precipice of passing the Build Back Better Act in what they call reconciliation.This will be the most transformative investment in our social infrastructure in generations—because just like roads and bridges, care—child care, elder care, care for the differently able—that’s critical infrastructure people need to be able to go to work.The pandemic sidelined millions of people from the workforce—overwhelmingly women—to shoulder care responsibilities.And right now, one in four women say they can’t go back to work because they still don’t have childcare.We also want to make sure care jobs are GOOD jobs with family sustaining wages and benefits.Another reason the Build Back Better Act is going to be a game changer, is it includes a key piece of the PRO Act. First-of-their-kind penalties for employers who violate our right to organize. So that if they break the law, there will be REAL consequences.If we are going to unleash unprecedented organizing, we need the PRO Act—and a national public sector PRO Act right alongside it—to override Right to Work in Kentucky.We want to make sure the jobs now—and jobs on the horizon in new industries—will be good, union jobs.So all that money being invested in the clean energy future and American innovation are union-made.That includes EV battery plants coming to Kentucky.And we’re going to keep working every day to make sure the transition leaves no community behind.We’re going to keep pressing for full funding of investments like wage replacement, a bridge to pension, and job training programs that give people the choice to stay and prosper in their neighborhoods.That’s what solidarity is about. Taking care of each other now, and shaping the future of work.This is the inflection point. The moment we look back on 10, 20, 30 years from now, where we decided to go all in to build the most dynamic, bold and inclusive labor movement we’ve ever seen.So are you ready to organize like never before?Show them the labor movement is bold. Innovative. And growing for the future. We pave the path to better working conditions and we improve life for every working person in this country.So keep it going. Keep up the great work. Thank you and I can’t wait to see where we go from here.Have a great convention!

54,Shuler to Utility Workers: Power for America Paves the Way,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-utility-workers-power-america-paves-way,11-8-2021,"Hello everyone, I’m Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO.Thank you Jim (Slevin), Pat (Dillon), John (Duffy), Mike (Coleman) and the entire UWUA team for your passion, leadership and partnership. We are grateful for your activism at all levels of the AFL-CIO. And I’m so thrilled to be able to join you for this conference, even if it’s by video.We are in a moment folks—and we are building a bold, dynamic and inclusive labor movement to meet this moment.And to all the Power for America leaders and instructors: Your continued commitment to education and training are absolutely critical for taking us to the next level.Experience is one of the most valuable things we have in the labor movement.You’re using yours to teach, connect, and grow our movement.Technology is changing how we work.We’re transitioning to a clean energy future in the face of the climate crisis.And we are determined to keep pace with those changes—so that working people can always find hope and opportunities with the labor movement.Union training programs are the gold standard, and the pathway to high-demand fields—and life-changing, good union jobs.And we are laser-focused on recruiting women, people of color, veterans, and the formerly incarcerated.That’s exactly what Power for America has spent 12 years doing—paving the pathways to the middle class for utility workers and apprentices.The labor movement has been training workers through apprenticeship for more than 100 years.It’s how we’ve grown through past massive shifts in the economy.Just like we innovated in the past, we’re innovating today.The clean energy future will be unionized—because you’re providing training for an emerging workforce to meet tomorrow’s energy industries, empowering Utility Workers to move seamlessly between onshore and offshore wind—between solar generation and battery storage.On-the-job training and skills development in clean energy will be in demand for a long time to come.And because Power for America is top of the class, it can be a model for innovating apprenticeships in other sectors—like manufacturing, health care, hospitality.You make sure your members are the best at what they do.And because of it, Utility Workers will keep powering America for generations to come.We have a historic opportunity to create more good, union jobs.With the jobs bills before Congress, we’re on the brink of passing massive investments in working people and our communities.This is the biggest worker training opportunity in almost 100 years.And I know you are ready to meet this moment.What’s so special about Power for America is that it’s a collaboration—labor AND management.You help tailor the training to meet employer needs.You have a common goal—to develop a highly trained workforce that delivers the safest, best quality work.Company partners realize workers are an asset—not a cost against their bottom line.That partnership is creating some of the most effective and important talent pipelines in the U.S.And provides workers in coal communities a path forward during America’s energy transition.You are a source of power for working people. And you help families across America build better lives. Keep it going!Utility Workers and Power for America, thank you—I can’t wait to see where we go from here!

55,Shuler: CSEA Makes the Difference for California's Students,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-csea-makes-difference-californias-students,11-4-2021,"Hello, California School Employees Association! 
 
I’m Liz Shuler, President of the AFL-CIO. It’s good to be with you, even if it’s by video. 
 
Thank you so much to Shane Dishman for your leadership and for being such a great partner at all levels of the federation, and I want to wish Clyde Rivers a happy retirement—thank you Clyde, for 20 years of service on the AFL-CIO Executive Council. 
 
CSEA members. I want you to hear this: Thank you. 
 
You may often feel like the unsung and overlooked heroes in our public schools and community colleges.
 
But the work you’ve done and continue to do throughout the pandemic has a ripple effect and affects so many lives.
 
The difference you make for students today is what they’re going to remember decades from now. 
 
How bus drivers delivered meals and provided hotspots in communities where the internet wasn’t easy to reach. 
 
Determined not to lose a generation of learners—that librarians took their services on the road—mobile libraries kept students and families engaged in reading.
 
And where there was no infrastructure, CSEA members innovated it. 
 
IT staff loaded, sanitized and distributed chrome books to students. 
 
One IT team even put up a 20 foot tower for internet access. 
 
That is exactly what we want every person in this country to see. 
 
Our labor movement is bold, dynamic and we use our collective power—to lift up each other and the communities where we work.
 
And we want everyone to see and know the union difference. 
 
CSEA members bring perspectives from different backgrounds and generations. That diversity is a strength. 
 
And by working together—committing to union and volunteer work—side by side, members and staff are successfully raising worker voices for fair wages, retirement security, respect and progress for racial justice and gender equity. 
 
As an independent union, member voice and vote directly drives your priorities. 
 
And after decades of fighting for it, you won legislation that creates layoff parity. 
 
Your passion for your work and your union make life better for students, families, and every working person in this country. 
 
And you are part of a movement that is looking toward the future—keeping pace with change—and being bold to meet the moment. 
 
Together, with our 57 unions with 12.5 million people in the AFL-CIO, working in jobs all across the economy, we are the most powerful force for progress for all working people in this country. 
 
Keep fighting forward, CSEA—I can’t wait to see where we go from here. Thank you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
56,Shuler to IBEW: Unions are Transformational,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-ibew-unions-are-transformational,11-1-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks to the 2021 IBEW Membership Development Conference:Hello, IBEW! It’s so good to be back home, and see friends from all across the country.So thank you to everyone who is making this virtual conference possible, especially Ricky Oakland, who I know works his tail off to make this happen.Thank you Lonnie Stephenson and Kenny Cooper—IBEW is one of the strongest unions in North America thanks to their outstanding leadership. And to the Vice Presidents, IEC leadership and to the leaders and members, you are the heartbeat of our labor movement.And on a personal note, I want to thank both of you for your encouragement and support through this unexpected transition at the AFL-CIO. And to so many of you for your kind messages it’s kept us going, and been a personal comfort, knowing the IBEW is there.As a movement, we’ve weathered challenges and loss, the personal and economic toll of COVID.But we are rising to meet this moment, and organize for the future.Now is the time to be bold, take risks, and unlock union growth. We are going to build the most dynamic and inclusive labor movement yet—because if not now, then when? So many working people out there are hungry for change and it’s up to us to show them that unions are the path forward.Unions are transformational. Everyone here has a story about the union difference.For my family, it started when my dad returned home from fighting in Vietnam—he went to work for the local power company and a union lineman apprenticeship program put him on the path to a good job at Portland General Electric.And that job put our family on the path to the middle class.My father grew up in poverty, often didn’t have enough to eat—and in one generation, the union difference meant his kids didn’t have to worry about a stable roof over our head—or us having food to eat.Every working person in this country should have that life-changing power of a good, union job.But to get there, we have to be ready to meet the needs of a changing workforce. Be ready to experiment, take risks, and innovate.We have to anticipate, and keep at least one step ahead of changes in the economy.The organizing we do now is going to shape the power structures in this country.There’s a lot riding on what we do. Because the American middle class that we worked so hard to build has been hollowed out.In the same generation that my family found the American dream, we lost it—because Enron bought the power company and its fraud and corporate greed destroyed retirement security for my dad—and the entire community when it filed for bankruptcy.As a country, we’ve suffered skyrocketing corporate greed because of attacks on unions and our organizing rights.Bad policy enabled offshoring and outsourcing.Young workers are living a generational backslide.And now, we’re being put at risk and treated as expendable throughout this pandemic. Are we going to take it any more?No. We’re done. And the labor movement is driving a nationwide reckoning. We’re taking courageous action.Nearly 100,000 union members are either on strike or willing to go on strike across industries and all over the country. I’m walking the picket line with UAW members at John Deere in Moline IL. They reached a TA on Saturday, but they don’t vote until tomorrow, so today is literally one day longer, one day stronger. What’s so inspiring though, is the solidarity. And I’m seeing IBEW members walking the picket lines all across the country. Tom Townsend Local 704 has been out walking with me this morning!And the nation is watching. People are with us. Across party lines—nearly 75 percent of voters agree—working people can and should join together to win a fairer share of the gains we create.Our challenge—what I think about constantly—is how we turn this momentum into organizing breakthroughs.That’s why your work is critical.And look at the progress you’ve made:You welcomed nuclear security officers at the Tennessee Valley Authority.Storm Chasers with an outside construction contractor.And you’ve managed to hit another all time high in construction membership!To grow, we also need investments. We have a generational opportunity.With the bipartisan infrastructure bill and reconciliation, we’re on the brink of passing historic investments in working people and our communities.There’s a lot of talk about how this sausage is getting made in Washington—what’s in—what’s out.But no one is going to remember that in the end.What they're going to remember are the jobs it creates.And as a movement, we’re going to make sure those are good, union jobs.IBEW is especially leading the way for an equitable clean energy transition.Because the only way we can meet the urgency of the climate crisis is with a high-road strategy that creates good, union jobs.And IBEW members are showing that the clean energy future runs right through the labor movement—from coast to coast—IBEW members in Rhode Island built the first offshore wind farm—in California, they’re operating the largest floating solar farm.At the same time, we need to reclaim our organizing rights.We need to pass the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act.Imagine if corporations had to pay when they violate labor law.Well, when reconciliation passes, it looks like it will include this key piece of the PRO Act—financial penalties to hold employers accountable.That means if they break the law, there will be REAL consequences.That could be a game-changer for organizing.And when you organize—because a union card is the best way to close wage gaps and guarantee equal pay—you’re also organizing for racial justice and gender equity.I got my own start in the labor movement by mobilizing and organizing for equity.At that same electrical utility where my dad worked—the clerical workers, nearly all women, including my mom—weren’t treated with the same respect because they weren't in the union.So we organized.I remember the first house call I made. I tried to capture it all on paper.But the way the system worked, the richness of that conversation wasn’t captured.Until a few years ago, those days of clipboards and frantic sticky notes and paper everywhere really hadn’t evolved much.We were using software from before Y2K. But a tool called Action Builder has been a breakthrough. You’ll hear more about it later in the conference.But I want to highlight how we didn’t just invent a technology and say here, use this.The AFL-CIO brought organizers to the table, like Adrian Sauceda, international representative in the Membership Development Department.And we asked, what do you need? What should we build and how? And we built a tool that’s democratizing organizing—making it more accessible for everyone.Action builder is a case study in labor innovation. And union innovation impacts everyone.That’s part of our history. Innovations from the labor movement—like the weekend—challenged inhumane economic conditions in the past.History is repeating itself today: We’re again challenging economic conditions—and Action Builder is an innovation we’re using to organize the change working people are hungry for.It’s helping us reach millennials—the largest generation in the workforce—and the most interested generation in joining unions—more than 60%.Amazing potential is right there.So don’t hold back. Take risks. Reach.Over 12.5 million working people in 57 unions—we are the most powerful vehicle for progress in this country.Our time is now.I talked about the transformational change the IBEW had on my family’s life—the IBEW runs deep in my veins—and every single day of my life, the values I learned from this great union guide me at every turn.The work you all do as organizer makes lives better for workers and their familiesI am so proud to lead the AFL-CIO as your IBEW sister.And together, I can’t wait to see where we go from here. Thank you!

57,Redmond: Alliance of Health Care Unions Are United to Win,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-alliance-health-care-unions-are-united-win,10-30-2021,"Thank you, Brother Norberto (Gomez), for the kind introduction and for your leadership of this loud and proud Steelworker local.And thank you Hal (Ruddick), Kathleen (Theobald), Denise (Duncan) and the entire Alliance team for your grit and dedication.My brother, USW District 12 Director Galen Prescott. Brother Lee Saunders, President of AFSCME.I’m Fred Redmond, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, International Vice President and proud dues paying member of the United Steelworkers.I am so thrilled to be here with you today.I know I don’t need to say this, but know the entire labor movement is with you every step of the way in this fight for a fair contract!Look what’s happening across the country right now. Working people have had enough. We’re rising up! Workers are mobilizing and striking! We’re working for a better tomorrow for all working people!Not only are we fighting, we’re winning!Safer workplaces. Better pay and benefits. Dignity on the job.And you are going to win too.How do I know that? All I have to do is look at the resolve of members of the alliance.95 percent voted to authorize a strike. 95 percent!That tells me you’re all together. For one purpose. For one cause!And Kaiser knows that too.Now look, this company isn’t exactly hurting. It’s one of the largest, most profitable healthcare companies in the United States. In the second quarter of this year, it raked in 2 billion dollars. 2 billion in a single quarter!It sits on 44 billion in reserves. Billion with a B.This is not a company in financial distress.So why is Kaiser acting like one?It thrived during the pandemic.Because of you! Working people! Union people!You go in every day and take care of patients. You risk your health and safety to do your job.Without always having adequate staffing. Without always having the proper protective gear.You nurse patients back to health.You run tests. You feed them. You bathe them. You wash their linens. You clean and sanitize their rooms.And you hold their hands while they are dying.You are the comforting light in the darkness. You are heroic!And you should be treated like heroes. And you should be compensated and respected like heroes.What Kaiser proposed is a joke.All across the country health care professionals are overworked, under-respected, and struggling to continue in a profession they love.Half a million workers have left health care since the beginning of the pandemic.And I can understand why. They’re exhausted. Burned out. Underappreciated.6 out of 10 frontline healthcare workers say the pandemic had a negative effect on their mental health.And 1 in 3 nurses are considering leaving the bedside. Or have already left.The entire healthcare industry has recognized that—well everyone except Kaiser.  Most places are staffing up. Raising wages. And a lot of them are treating their workers like the valuable assets they are.Yet Kaiser is acting like you are a cost. A number against their bottom line.And this way of thinking not only hurts workers, it hurts the patients you serve.Poor staffing leads to poor health outcomes for patients.Let me say that again. Poor staffing leads to poor health outcomes for patients.When healthcare workers are overworked, patients suffer.That’s the horrible truth.Now look, for more than 30 years you have had a labor management partnership with Kaiser. And during that time, you worked together to solve problems. You came together and made decisions on staffing, on equity, on patient care that benefited the company, the workers and the patients. But I understand that Kaiser’s new leadership is no longer listening to your proposals.And I understand they rejected your recommendations that would solve problems related to systemic racism and social inequities throughout the organization.Kaiser likes to say they’re fighting racial injustice. They’ve pledged millions in grants for community programs to end systemic racism.But if they really cared—if they really want to make real change—they should look no further than their own workforce.Now, the labor movement has been fighting for equal pay for equal work since the beginning of time.Equal pay for equal work. It’s a fairly straight-forward concept.But for years Kaiser Permanente has paid different rates to workers doing the exact same job.Particularly in service jobs, a lot of them my fellow Steelworkers, that are overwhelmingly held by people of color.And not just a little less. Significantly less. As much as 39 percent less.This is not a regional wage difference. Some of these jobs are right next door, just a few miles away.It’s a racial wage difference.There is no justifiable reason for workers in one county in southern California to be paid significantly less than workers in the county next door. None.I heard about Kaiser’s 2-tier wage proposal.Well, brothers and sisters, they’ve picked the wrong fight with the wrong unions!!Is this what Kaiser wants?Well if it is, then we will give them a fight! Not just with workers in California, or healthcare workers, but with the entire labor movement!We won’t let them divide us!We won’t let them sell out our future!Because you deserve better!Your patients deserve better!And there’s nothing we can’t do when we stand together!Solidarity today!Solidarity tomorrow!Solidarity forever!© 2023 AFL-CIO.

58,Shuler: A Clean Energy Future Runs Through the Labor Movement,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-clean-energy-future-runs-through-labor-movement,10-26-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks to the Global Unions’ Committee on Workers’ Capital at the 2021 Workers’ Capital Virtual Conference:Hi everyone, I’m Liz Shuler, President of the AFL-CIO—we’re representing 57 unions with 12.5 million people working in jobs all across the economy in the U.S. and Canada.Thank you Sharan Burrow, our fearless leader, and I also want to recognize Tuur Elzinga and Paddy Crumlin, for leading the Committee for Workers Capital through the challenges of the worst ever global health crisis.It’s an honor to join you as co-chair and to be here to say a few words ahead of this fabulous panel. Thank you Aubrey and Lyon from our affiliate union LIUNA, for bringing the worker perspective from the U.S.—I know it will be a great discussion.And of course, thank you Hugues, Tamara and Shalini, for serving as the CWC’s secretariat staff throughout the year and for your hard work to make this conference possible—it’s a big lift because we’re virtual and we’re global.Since the CWC’s last conference, we’ve all weathered incredible loss, and we at the AFL-CIO are still grieving the passing of my friend and trade union brother, Richard Trumka.We miss him every day. We’re honoring his legacy by staying focused and moving forward—just like he’d want.This panel discussion is very timely.The question being asked—”Where do labor rights fit in as private market funds ramp up their net-zero commitments?”—is a good one. And my answer is simple: Labor rights should be front and center.As we speak, the working people I’m honored to represent are leading the response to the climate crisis—repairing, rescuing, designing and, of course, members of LIUNA are building it.The path to the clean energy future runs right through the labor movement.And we hear the phrase “just transition” used a lot. But it’s a meaningless phrase if the transition leaves any working person or community behind.We need support for workers in industries that are declining—wage replacement for those who are displaced, a bridge to pension and local job training programs.Policy, trade and investments should create jobs, use a racial justice and gender equity lens, and deliver place-based strategies.We need guaranteed labor rights, including the right to organize with our co-workers in unions, because unions are transformational.Unions are how we transform bad jobs into good jobs.Think back to the early days of the carbon-fuel economy, those energy jobs were dangerous and poorly paid.Industry by industry, nation by nation, through our unions, working people transformed low-wage, dangerous work into good jobs—careers with safety protections and retirement security.As we build the clean energy future, every working person should have access to the life-changing power of a good, union job.But as we know, that is not the case today. Renewable energy jobs in the U.S. are largely non-union—they pay a fraction of what existing energy jobs do and most don’t offer benefits or retirement security.For a sustainable, equitable clean energy future, we need to transform the renewable energy industries with a high-road, high-wage strategy.It can be done. The off-shore wind sector is a great example and a model to replicate.We worked out a top-down labor partnership with the developers—we decided together that we were going to work collaboratively to create a high road strategy.Union labor from the U.S. building trades will build multiple offshore wind projects up and down the East Coast of the United States.A robust and a pro-active labor strategy makes good investment sense.Renewable energy projects that take a best-value approach are more successful, and safer, than those using the lowest-cost contractor.Responsible contractor policies and project labor agreements help make sure projects are delivered on time and to specifications. And that they work.The success of any project depends on the training and experience of the workforce. Unions represent the highest skilled workforce.Our apprenticeship readiness and apprenticeship training programs are the gold standard. And they put people on the path to the middle class.And we are laser focused on diversity—recruiting women, people of color, veterans, and the formerly incarcerated.Wind is one sector, and I know you’ll be talking about solar.We applaud President Biden for banning the U.S. from importing solar cells manufactured with forced labor in the supply chain. We want to make sure every part of the global solar supply chain is built with high-road worker rights and environmental protections.In recent years we have seen a dramatic increase in renewable energy investment by private equity, real estate and infrastructure funds. But are these private funds addressing the need for an equitable transition for workers?Our pension plans are allocating capital to private funds that are investing in the clean energy economy. We have a choice to make—and with those choices, we have power.Do we take a high road to invest in labor partnerships and broad based prosperity? Or do we take the low road that will result in a race to the bottom?The labor movement will exercise our power to make prudent investments in private funds that stand with us.Especially because COVID-19 has exposed the precarious economic situation of workers around the globe.In these uncertain times, successful investment funds recognize that creating good jobs is the best way to achieve the financial returns that our pension plans need to pay promised retirement benefits.And with the climate crisis, it’s not an either-or-issue: either we protect the environment or keep and create good jobs. NO. Answering the climate crisis means doing both.So the discussion and decisions about private equity, real estate, infrastructure and technology investments should have a worker voice and perspective at the table.That’s exactly what we’re doing with this panel. Thank you.And with that, I will turn it over to Tamara to introduce our panel moderator, Catherine Bolger who is a trustee of State Super in Australia.

59,Shuler: Worker Voice Is Important in Technology Development,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-worker-voice-important-technology-development,10-26-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks to the L20 Summit in Rome:Thank you General Secretary Habbard, and our leader Sharan Burrow and the ITUC, our Italian colleagues, and global partners. I appreciate the opportunity to reflect on the panelists' comments.We are meeting at an incredible moment. But we didn’t reach this point overnight.Before COVID-19, we saw decades of attacks on union rights, under-investment in infrastructure and communities, and as a result union density has declined and inequality has skyrocketed. In the U.S., the American middle class we worked so hard to build has been hollowed out.Professor Mazzucato reminded us that while we responded to the Great Recession by bailing out the financial services industry, we left structural inequity and its underlying causes intact. And working people never truly recovered.To pay for the bailouts, austerity measures shrank governments. It hurt communities and public service workers—who are disproportionately women and people of color. And meanwhile, corporate power skyrocketed.But future generations will look at this moment and the decisions we make. As Professor Mazzucato said, it’s about choices. This is our chance to make the policy decisions to balance the scales.Governments seem ready to act at least on a global, minimum tax to reign in the excesses of global corporations, because we know they use their power to evade fair taxes.But more needs to be done. Working people have been pushed to their limits and they’re demanding better.Right now, as I speak, across industries and all over the U.S. 100,000 union workers are either on strike or have authorized a strike.That courageous action is how the labor movement challenged inhumane economic conditions in the past. And history is repeating itself today.As Director Ryder said, labor markets are flat and there is an unequal distribution of relief—we have to work together to build a better, more inclusive economy—with investments in infrastructure, including care. An equitable clean energy transition. And by reclaiming our rights to stand together in unions without fear.President Biden calls his agenda Build Back Better with Unions.We need to focus on the next frontiers of research and innovation. Who will build it? Who will benefit? Working people should be at the center of those policies and at the table in the science and engineering enterprise.For example, the former U.S. space program was funded entirely by tax dollars. It gave rise to new technologies and private sector companies. It supported families and local communities. It was built and run by union labor.Now we are seeing, private companies dedicated to space exploration have received billions in government aid. But working people aren’t getting a widely shared return of the profit.As we respond to our next moon-shots, challenges like the climate crisis, we need fair models of public investment. We want the gains from public investments to be shared and create good jobs.Worker perspective and voice should shape technology before, during, and as its developed.The financial crisis and COVID show how interconnected we are.Especially as we build the clean energy future, we want to make sure every part of the global supply chain is built with high-road worker rights and environmental protections. We applaud President Biden for banning the U.S. from importing solar cells manufactured with forced labor in the supply chain.The answer to a sustainable, global economic future is not unchecked automation and unregulated corporate greed. Governments need to do more than tax corporations. We need to level the playing field for working people.Ultimately, this discussion is not about more state or less state, but a different type of state, one that brings worker voice to the table. That’s part of a healthy democracy—a say in our economic future through our unions.That’s how we will build back better—with and for working people. Keyword better—than it is, or ever was.Thank you.

60,Shuler: UFCW Women Are on the Rise,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-ufcw-women-are-rise,10-26-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks to the UFCW Women's Network 14th Convention:Hello UFCW women’s network! I’m so excited to be with you today, even if it’s still by Zoom.I want to thank your international president Marc Perrone. Throughout this pandemic he’s been a tireless and constant force for working people, and a thought partner and source of strength as we chart a path forward for the federation.And big thank you to all my Canadian siblings, and UFCW Canada President Paul Meinema, for your leadership to make UFCW a powerhouse for working families across North America.A big thank you to Deliana for your hard work, dedication and drive. I loved hearing about the focus on mentorship and bringing up the next generation in the union! And to everyone at the UFCW Women’s Network, THANK YOU.This conference is an incubator for the organizing and activism that’s moving women to the center in our unions, at work and in the economy.I attended a Women’s network convention many moons ago, and I looked back and it was in San Diego in 2014. At that time, we were focused on getting more women elected to public office and into leadership roles in the labor movement.We still have a long way to go to get to gender equity, but just think for a minute about how far we’ve traveled in those 7 years.Women are upholding our democracy at the ballot box and in our workplaces.We have the highest number of women ever in Congress and a pro-worker majority.Vice President-elect Kamala Harris is the first woman and multiracial person to serve in the second highest office in the country. And she says the word “union” everywhere she goes.Today, more women are serving in leadership in UFCW local unions and the international union.And UFCW women are getting us through the pandemic. Working on the frontlines in grocery stores, in packing and processing plants, retail stores, pharmacies, healthcare centers and more.In the darkest, hardest part of the pandemic, you worked overtime to feed and care and provide for this country.In this incredible moment Women have been out in front, leading strikes and marching on picket lines—like UFCW distillery workers in Kentucky.Everyone is asking, “what’s happening?” Well you know what’s happening—the labor movement is driving a nationwide reckoning. We’re standing up and taking risks to fix what’s broken. And it’s capturing the national imagination.They’re calling it Striketober because 100,000 union members are either on strike or willing to go on strike across industries in places all over the country.We just got polling data—75 percent of voters agree: Working people can and should join together to win a better deal and a better life.It takes courage to go on strike. Women across the labor movement are standing up and showing solidarity on the picket lines with their fellow union members, to let them know that we have their back and we’re going to use the full power of our movement to help. them. WIN.We want to show all those workers out there, especially young workers not yet in unions, that it’s worth it. That the power of a union means when you walk out with your co-workers, you can return together with better wages, benefits and working conditions.In fact, just a few days ago those Heaven Hill distillery workers voted to end a 6 week strike. The tentative agreement:That’s thanks to the UFCW, the leading voice for Kentucky frontline workers.We want every working woman in this country to see and know that union difference. That when they stand together with their coworkers in unions they can win.That’s why women are also stepping up as organizers. Look at the organizing drive at Amazon in Bessemer, Alabama.Black women led, courageously organized, stood up and said we are not robots, we deserve to be treated with dignity.That campaign was about fundamental worker power, inequality, racial and gender justice.And we know that wasn’t the end, it was just the powerful beginning. Whatever the next step is, bring it on, the entire labor movement will be there every step of the way!I got my own start in the labor movement by mobilizing and organizing for equity. Clerical workers (nearly all women) at the electric utility where I worked weren’t treated with the same respect as the power linemen because they were in the union. So we organized. I realized pretty quickly that women sticking together is a pretty powerful thing.And I’ve reached this leadership point through a simple but important strategy: working with and standing on the shoulders of the women in our movement.I would not be here without that network of support. Women who lift each other up and help each other step into leadership roles.That’s one of the superpowers of the UFCW Women’s Network.Now is our time—women are on the rise. And I promise you this:We are building a bold and inclusive movement with women and people of color at the center.We are using an intersectional lens to challenge the roles we play and the stereotypes about how we define leadership.It doesn’t always have to be pounding a lectern or beating your chest or pointing a finger at an elected official. We can bring a different leadership style and it’s just as powerful.Women are leading out front, and women are also leading behind the scenes in workplaces all across the country.We’re using the power of our unions to make sure our voices are heard. We’re speaking up about issues that matter to us, our co-workers, families and communities.There’s one thing that keeps me awake at night, and it’s that we need to grow our movement—not for selfish reasons, but because we are the counterforce to skyrocketing inequality. Putting power on the side of working people through unions is how we balance the scales in our economy. And the most powerful way to do that is to pass the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act.A union contract is the best way to close pay gaps, guarantee equal pay and fight discrimination at work.We want good, sustainable union jobs. But to get them, women need to be able to stand together with coworkers in unions without the fear of getting fired.The PRO Act and Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act will eliminate those barriers by holding union-busting employers accountable with real penalties.Imagine the organizing potential we can unlock. In fact, the labor movement is already the largest organization of working women in the country. We’re 6.5 million strong. And growing.For the women on the frontlines—or those who’ve been sidelined—for the rising generation—and for the women who are worried about retirement—I want every working woman in every kind of job to see they have a place in our movement.Women are on track to be the majority of union members by 2025. We’re on track to see more women lead—thanks to the great work of the UFCW Women’s network.And with the bold, powerful and dynamic labor movement we’re building now, we’re going to make life better for every working woman in this country.I can’t wait to come back to this conference in the future and we will be talking about all the progress we’ve made from this point forward.I can’t wait to see where we go from here! Thank you and keep up the incredible work!

61,Shuler: Maine Is Organizing and Winning,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-maine-organizing-and-winning,10-26-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the Maine AFL-CIO Convention:Hello Maine, Labor!I’m honored to be with you—even by video.Thank you Cynthia, Doug, Patrick, all the officers—and of course Matt and the entire team for your hard work and dedication.Cynthia, my IBEW sister—you’re blazing a trail as the first woman to lead the Maine federation.And I know from experience how the IBEW prepares women to step into leadership roles, thank you for doing such an incredible job.And to all of you, thank you for your resilience.Our entire movement sees and feels the work Maine labor does.This pandemic has been devastating.It’s pushed us to a breaking point.I don't know about you, but it makes me angry to see corporations taking advantage of the sacrifices we’ve made.They’re relentlessly pursuing profits, expecting us to accept less, risk our lives—and we’re not going to take it.We’re not going to put up with unfair and unsafe working conditions.We’re done with downward pressure on wages and benefits.We’re not going to sell out the next generation.We were, are, and will always be essential. And we deserve to be treated like it.We deserve a fair share of the profits we create.And every working person in this country deserves the life-changing power of a good, union job.This is our moment.We have the highest approval rating among the public in over 50 years.Workers are standing up and taking risks. People are reclaiming their power through their unions.Maine is showing every working person in this country what’s possible when we stand together in solidarity.We saw it last summer when over 4,000 Machinists went on strike against Bath Iron Works. After 10 weeks on the picket line, they won a fair contract!The Maine AFL-CIO was there every step of the way. You gave the support and you helped build the groundswell that is inspiring workers across the country.I’m not sure we’ve ever been able to claim this before—but we’re trending on Twitter! Check out the hashtag: Striketober.100,000 union members are either on strike or have authorized a strike. Right now—this is across industries and all over the country.This is how we win progress. We build pressure and momentum, and grow our power as one united labor movement.And Maine is a perfect example. Last year Maine grew its union membership by 13,000 members! A three percent increase. That’s incredible! In an era where union membership keeps going down, we want to do what you’re doing so we can grow 3 percent across the entire country!You are reaching out to workers—some who have never had contact with a union before. You’re connecting with them. Educating. Earning their trust. And organizing.Drivers in Waterville. Transit workers in Southern Maine. Nurses in Portland.These organizing wins lead to more organizing wins—and legislative wins too.You worked to beat back a right to work bill.You pushed to reform the state’s unemployment system so working people have access to benefits and training.That didn’t just happen—you put the work in to win elections. And now we have a pro-worker congress and White House.We have a union member as the Secretary of Labor.And a union member as the President of the Maine Senate.How incredible was it that those two got together recently to discuss the challenges loggers and wood haulers face in Northern Maine?That’s the power of electing union members to public office.We need to keep our foot on the accelerator!Because we have a lot of enemies out there who want to stifle us. It’s still easier for a corporation to stop a union than it is for a worker to form one.Museum workers in Portland and our courageous nurses at Maine Medical know what I mean. You were bullied and harassed and forced to participate in captive audience meetings held by unvaccinated, union-busting consultants.To give workers more power and take away those barriers people face when they try to join a union, we need the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act.We also need investments in working people and our communities.That’s why we fully support both the reconciliation and the bipartisan infrastructure bills.These are the biggest investments in almost 100 years—in infrastructure—manufacturing—supply chains.Roads. Bridges. Waterways. Public transportation. Rural broadband.Job training and public education.AND paid family and medical leave, child care investments and universal pre-k—because care is also critical infrastructure. We are fighting to keep them in the bill, because we need those investments. People have been sidelined by caregiving responsibilities during the pandemic and can’t get back to work without them.And we need to make sure care jobs are GOOD jobs with family sustaining wages and benefits.You may have heard that the reconciliation bill also includes a key piece of the PRO Act. First-of-their-kind penalties for employers who violate our right to organize. So that if they break the law, there will be REAL consequences.This is the kind of bold plan that puts workers at the center of policy and will help us recover from the pandemic and decades of neglect and under-investment.This is our chance to create good, sustainable union jobs, now and for the next generation—revive American industries—and build back better in towns and local economies all over Maine. Game-changing opportunities are on the table.This is the inflection point. The moment we look back on 10, 20, 30 years from now, where we decided to grow our labor movement into the most dynamic, bold and inclusive labor movement we’ve ever seen.So are you ready to organize like never before?Workers out there are looking for hope and a better life.Let’s show them they can find it with the labor movement in Maine.So keep it going. Keep up the great work. Thank you and I can’t wait to see where we go from here.Have a great convention!

I’m thrilled to be here with Lee (Saunders) and this incredible group of union leaders and lawmakers today to talk about this important legislation.First, I want to say thank you to public service workers all across the country.We see you and the work you do to keep families healthy and safe in every single community... In the face of Janus and anti-worker state legislatures and of course, COVID-19.These are the working people in our schools and universities, working at all levels of education. The folks keeping our hospitals, libraries and museums running.They answer the call for help as first responders, pick up trash, make sure our parks are clean and our water is safe to drink and so much more.They work with the vulnerable and marginalized communities. They care for the elderly, our children, and the differently abled.And through the worst ever global public health crisis, public service workers continue to step up.Especially at the height of the pandemic, our members in the public sector have made incredible sacrifices to keep services moving and support our communities.They were, are, and will always be essential.Like all working people in this country, public service workers deserve the right to stand together with their coworkers in a union, to bargain together for safer and fairer working conditions.That’s why we need to pass the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act.Just like its private sector equivalent, the PRO Act, the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act is critical to building an economy that works for everyone.We know that millions of working people would join a union today if they could. But they are afraid they’ll lose their jobs. The Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act and the PRO Act would remove those barriers in the way—like the fear of getting fired.Passing the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act is also a racial justice and gender equity issue. The public sector is a key employer for women and people of color. A majority of public service workers are women. And one in three public service workers are African American, Latino, or Asian American and Pacific Islanders.Union contracts close wage gaps and guarantee equal pay.Union contracts provide women and people of color with protections and support to confront and address discrimination at work.And workers with a union are more likely to have access to benefits like paid family, medical and sick leave. Passing the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act will make it easier for millions of public service workers to benefit from the union difference.That’s exactly what we need to Build Back Better as we continue to navigate and work to recover from the pandemic.We’re having a moment in the country right now. #Striketober. Workers are not going to put up with poverty wages, little to no benefits and they’re not going to risk their lives when there’s a lack of safety protections on the job.Passing the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act will make sure working people in the public sector have good, sustainable jobs. That’s good for working people and the communities they serve.Thank you to Congressman Cartwright for being a steadfast labor champion and reintroducing this critical legislation.The 12.5 million members of the AFL-CIO will not rest until the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act is the law of the land. Thank you.

63,Shuler: Veterans Are Powerful Voices in Our Unions,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-veterans-are-powerful-voices-our-unions,10-25-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the Union Veterans Council:Hi everyone, I’m Liz Shuler. President of the AFL-CIO.Thank you so much for joining us.The AFL-CIO family is 57 unions with 12.5 million working people all across the country including more than 1 million veterans.Our Union Veterans Council is launching a campaign to engage, educate, and mobilize our veteran’s community.We’ll officially roll it out on Veterans Day, but we want to start telling the stories of resilience and success of our union veterans now.I’ll share mine. My dad was a member of IBEW Local 125 and a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps.He grew up poor, working in the orchards of Hood River Oregon where his family lived in a one room fruit picking shack. He and his four siblings often went hungry.To help make ends meet, started working at age 12, sandblasting tombstones.He signed up to join the Marine Corps right out of high school, and was deployed straight to Vietnam.When he returned, he faced the question most veterans do: now what?A union lineman apprenticeship program put him on the path to a good job at Portland General Electric.And that job put our family on the path to the middle class.Unions are transformational.In one generation, the union difference meant not having to worry about a stable roof over our head or having enough to eat.That’s what drives me every single day:Every working person in this country, especially our veterans and their families, should have the life-changing power of a good, union job.As a movement, we build economic power for working people. But more than that, we are a community.You’re seeing our solidarity on picket lines right now, all across the country.And when veterans have access to the solidarity and opportunities of the labor movement, they succeed.They help lead our entire movement forward.Look at Will Attig.When he returned from Iraq, he felt lost.But then he found Helmets to Hardhats—a program that connects transitioning active-duty military service members and veterans to training and career opportunities in the construction industry.And now, as the Executive Director of the Union Veterans Council, his leadership and dedication are taking our Veteran efforts to a new level.Thank you so much, Will.And here’s a little known fact we want everyone to know.After the U.S. military, the labor movement has the largest job training network in the country.Our apprenticeship programs are the gold standard and we are laser focused on recruiting veterans.Veterans like Rachel who, through the United Association’s Veterans In Piping Program, transitioned out of the military, obtained the 8 advanced UA welding certifications before leaving the military to become a journeyperson pipefitter .I was thrilled she joined me last August at the White House to share her experience.Once veterans become part of the labor movement, they engage it, they shape it.And we especially want to invest in the next generation as we build a bold, dynamic and inclusive movement.Veterans bring invaluable experience to the table.They’ve served our country and apply that same self-sacrifice and dedication to their unions and our movement: mobilizing to persuade other veterans to vote in 2020; on the picket lines raising their voices; and at the collective bargaining table demanding their fair share.The labor movement has always engaged and supported veterans, but never at scale, across the entire labor movement. Until now.We’re engaging our allies too, like Congressman Conor Lamb, a Marine Veteran and labor champion who serves on the powerful transportation and infrastructure committee, and the House Labor Caucus.He’s a proud sponsor of the PRO Act.That bill will remove the barriers people face when they try to join a union, like the fear of getting fired. We need to pass the PRO Act, and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act.We also need investments in working people and our communities.That’s why we fully support both the reconciliation and the bipartisan infrastructure bills.This is the biggest American jobs and job training opportunity in almost 100 years.And it includes a key piece of the PRO Act. First-of-their-kind penalties for employers who violate our right to organize.That’s going to help us make sure those jobs are good, union jobs and grow opportunities for veterans.To all our veterans watching and listening: thank you for your service to our country and for being such an important part of the labor movement.Next, we’re going to cover how the labor movement can engage our union veteran members.Here’s the ask for those involved in the AFL-CIO state federations and central labor councils: Create Veteran’s Day events to lift up your veteran members. Let’s see these in every state!Veteran voices in our unions are so powerful, persuasive and unifying.Let’s start highlighting our veteran union members now.I can’t wait to hear stories of veterans succeeding from all across the labor movement.Thank you!

64,Redmond Celebrates Black Men in Unions,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-celebrates-black-men-unions,10-22-2021,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks as prepared to the Celebrating Black Men in Unions Conference:Thank you for that warm welcome.Good morning. I’m Fred Redmond, Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO. Before I begin I’d like to thank Charlie Flemming of the Georgia AFL-CIO, and James Williams and Sandra Williams of the Atlanta-North Georgia Labor Council for your leadership.I’d also like to thank UAW President Ray Curry for continuing to support this series of important discussions and panels. To Morehouse College for hosting this year’s conference and especially to Dr. (David) Thomas and Dr. (Cynthia) Hewitt for making me feel at home.And thank you to the conference organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak with you today.Today, I stand here as the highest ranking African American in the history of America’s labor movement.But I do not stand here alone. I am standing on the shoulders of giants.A. Philip Randolph. Bayard Rustin. Bill Lucy.And so many others who worked to advance racial and economic justice in a movement where the Black man wasn’t always welcomed. Nor his ideas. Where he had to scratch and claw to rise through the ranks.I want to talk about the history of the civil rights and labor movements. Where we came from. And where we go from here.The civil rights and labor movements are forever fused in our nation’s history.Dr. King was assassinated in Memphis while there in support of a sanitation workers strike.Five years before that, he delivered his most famous address on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Jobs and Freedom. Economic justice. Racial justice. Linked there together.And Dr. King said the labor-hater and the race-baiter is a twin-headed creature, spewing anti-Negro epithets from one mouth and anti-labor propaganda from the other mouth.He saw labor and civil rights as natural allies.But not everybody in the labor movement did.We are products of our society. Unions are no different.When the AFL and CIO merged in 1955, African Americans were largely shut out of craft unions. The skilled trades. Some of the unions had Caucasian clauses in their constitutions excluding non-whites. Some locals were segregated.But two Black men were seated on the executive council. Their appointments were hailed as “evidence” that labor intends to back up its “pledges” against segregation and discrimination in employment.Willard S. Townsend was one. He died of a heart attack two years later.And A. Philip Randolph was the other. He had been an outspoken force for black workers and civil rights for some 20 years.And he was the key figure who was able to align the civil rights and labor movements.It wasn’t easy navigating the internal politics within a mostly white institution. He had to battle against discrimination and segregation within the labor movement itself.But he was stubborn and tough. Unrelenting. And his persistence made the labor movement, and our country, better.In 1959, Randolph wanted the federation to take concrete action against segregated locals. Discriminatory seniority provisions. Exclusionist practices. The systematic barring of Blacks in leadership positions.He publicly called on President George Meany, and after a heated exchange, Meany pounded the lectern and roared: “Who the hell appointed you the guardian of all the Negroes in America?”Randolph was undeterred. He laid out recommendations on ways to eliminate segregation and discrimination within unions.These were rejected. Not only that but Meany pinned the blame on Randolph for the “gap that has developed between organized labor and the Negro community.”Two years later, Randolph along with Walter Reuther, the progressive president of the UAW, tricked Meany into inviting Dr. King to address the delegates at the 1961 convention.Dr. King delivered a speech titled “If the Negro Wins, Labor Wins.” It was well-received. King criticized the AFL–CIO for its tolerance of unions that excluded black workers. And he hoped for a coalition between civil rights and labor that would improve the situation for the entire working class by ending racial discrimination.Randolph was a key figure to build that coalition. And in 1963, he brought together civil rights, labor, and religious groups to organize the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.But when Dr. King called George Meany to ask for AFL-CIO’s financial and public support for the march, Meany denied the request. And demeaned and disrespected Dr. King in the process.Randolph ripped the AFL-CIO Executive Council’s failure to officially endorse the march. The march went on without our support of course. And tens of thousands of trade unionists present at the March on Washington heard the now iconic “I Have a Dream” speech delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.That demonstration for “Jobs and Freedom” called not only for desegregation and civil rights, but for economic policies designed to ensure the economic health of Black Americans.Some of those policies—like non-discrimination laws—existed but weren’t being enforced.Five months after the Jobs and Freedom march on Washington, the AFL-CIO Building Trades Department met in New York City.And they were met with picketers. Walking in the rain. Their signs read “Full integration of the Building Trades Unions” and “Job Equality for All.”On the surface, building trades unions appeared to be making progress with anti-discrimination clauses. Integrated locals. Apprenticeships for non-whites. But much of it was token. And New York politicians were reluctant to take on the building trades unions in their hiring practices.Unemployment in black communities—Harlem, Bed-Stuy—was double that in the rest of the city.The president of the building trades department was outraged. He likened these demonstrations as blackmail. He told the delegates “we won’t stand for blackmail—we had it from the gangsters and Communists in the 1930s and we fought it—and if we have to fight integration by blackmail today, fine, we’ll fight it.”He criticized the demonstrators and the civil rights movement. He said: “We’re not going to have people outside dictate to us, when half of them don’t know how to run their own affairs.”This is not meant to be critical of the labor movement or its leaders. George Meany’s thinking about racial and economic justice evolved.It’s meant to be illustrative. Back then the labor movement was more insular. Discriminatory. Top-down. It didn’t always include the people it served. It dictated.Fast forward to the 2017 convention in St. Louis.America again is in the midst of a public and intense reckoning on racial justice.Outside the convention hall we were met by a state senator and members of the Black community. They wanted justice. Racial AND economic. They used our convention as the picketers did in 1963 in New York. As a public way to voice their discontent.Instead of shutting them out we brought them in. Instead of denouncing. We listened.The late, great Richard Trumka said the American labor movement must be the tip of the spear in the fight against racism.And we have had tough conversations with local labor leaders around racial and economic disparities. Institutional biases. Ways to become more inclusive.Some of these conversations have moved the needle.But we need to do more than move the needle. We need to break the gauge.It was clear after the murder of George Floyd and the widespread demonstrations across the country, we’re still not listening hard enough. We’re still not speaking forcefully enough.The AFL-CIO headquarters was vandalized. A fire set in the lobby. We know there are people who seize the opportunity for anarchy. We don’t know who or their intentions. But what was clear is that the black community does not see us as an ally. The black community does not identify with the labor movement.We have to ask ourselves why? What role does labor play in solving mass incarceration and criminal justice reform?How can the labor movement help the black community ravaged by inequities in policing and the criminal justice system when some of our unions represent law enforcement officers?There was a public call for us to kick out police and law enforcement officers from our unions. I can understand why. The thinking is this: how can we be a progressive force for the oppressed while serving those who are doing the oppressing?I don’t have to tell you this is a complex and thorny issue. And the easy way out is to run away from it. It would be far easier to sweep it under the rug, dust our hands and walk away and say police reform is not our concern.But law enforcement officers are workers. And they, as workers, have rights to collectively bargain, to have a voice at work, whistleblower protections, as all workers should.But the problem is law enforcement is a broken profession.And the labor movement has a responsibility to fix the profession. And that is something we can’t do from the outside looking in.Last year, we created a task force on racial justice, which I chaired. And earlier this year, we developed a list of recommendations state and local governments and law enforcement agencies can take to fix the profession.We also created a program for law enforcement officers called ULEADS.This is something over which we have more control as a labor movement.This program is developed, owned and instituted by the union. It’s about weeding out wrong-doers from union membership and holding them accountable when they violate their professional oath, or abuse their power.The labor movement is uniquely positioned to tackle this issue and forge real change in our communities. To break down the blue wall of silence where it exists. And fix a broken profession for those who serve with honor every day.These are challenging times for our country and our labor movement. And we cannot afford to be silent.I’ve spent my entire life fighting for racial justice in the workplace and throughout our communities.At the aluminum mill in Chicago where I worked right out of high school and became shop steward and then as grievance chair. At the local where I became active in the fight for racial and economic justice and later elected as its president.At the United Steelworkers where I fought inequality and inequities in the field and at the bargaining table.And I will continue the fight at the AFL-CIO.A. Philip Randolph saw the labor movement as the vehicle to fight racism and poverty.And I see it the same way.We don’t have to battle against racial discrimination and segregation within the labor movement itself.But we do need to do battle—to make sure the work of the labor movement overcomes the efforts of those who want to divide us. And we do that by bringing people together.The author Isabel Wilkerson writes that the price of privilege is the moral duty to act when one sees another person treated unfairly.It is my privilege to serve America’s working people. And it is my moral duty to act in the face of injustice.And that is exactly what I aim to do.But I cannot do it alone.The labor movement is only as good as its people.We need your help.Our democracy is at stake.Help us beat back attacks on voting rights.Help us advance legislation like the PRO Act that will give everyone a chance at a good, union job. And close the economic gap for people of color.Help us build a broad, progressive coalition.Get involved in your union.Get involved with the labor movement.Together, we can save our democracy.Our children and grandchildren will hold us accountable for this moment in history.And if we’re courageous and persistent, we will be on the right side of it.Thank you.

65,Shuler Welcomes National Writers Union,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-welcomes-national-writers-union,10-21-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the National Writers Union Delegate Assembly:Hello, National Writers Union!I’m Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO. I’m honored to be with you, even if it is by video.Thank you to Larry, the NWU Executive Board and delegates for an incredible job leading this dynamic union forward.On behalf of our 57 unions and 12.5 million people working in every sector of our economy, we are so excited to have the NWU in our AFL-CIO family as a directly affiliated local union.Our job is to make sure you have the resources and solidarity you need to support your members, and connect your fights to the broader struggles working people are facing—because we are stronger together!The National Writers Union has provided a voice and power to writers for nearly 40 years.You educate freelance writers, journalists and creative professionals on fair contracts.You provide access to healthcare and benefits.And you make sure copyright and intellectual property rights for your members aren’t abused.The publishing industry is one of the toughest industries to break into.Freelance work often is an entry point for people pursuing a career in journalism. And it can be mystifying.Making pitches. Dealing with rejection. Winning a contract and then figuring out if it’s good or bad. Knowing the value of your work.All while navigating the ways technology continues to change the publishing landscape.You help writers and journalists navigate a difficult and demanding career path.If I had known about NWU after I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in journalism all those years ago, my career might have taken a different shape.Instead, I got involved in an organizing campaign to help clerical workers get the wages and benefits they deserved.And it has been my passion ever since. It’s why I get up every morning. To make sure working people get a fair deal. To fight corruption and misinformation. To help turn bad jobs into good jobs.There was a lot of misinformation about the PRO Act when it was introduced in Congress, especially around freelancing.Corporate interests led that misinformation campaign. It was intentional. They tried to muddy the waters. They tried to divide us.But you didn’t let them get away with it. You built a broad coalition with other unions, community organizations and worker groups. And you set the record straight.You communicated how the PRO Act would not prevent freelance journalists or creative professionals from doing freelance work.You put the spotlight on how the PRO Act will protect freelancers’ rights to organize and collectively bargain.How it will help you set and raise industry standards. Fair contracts. And consistent and equitable rates.And how it will empower segments of workers previously shut out from having a collective voice the opportunity to have one.That includes on-demand platform gig workers. Independent contractors. Freelancers.All workers should be able to organize without intimidation or fear of getting fired.Everyone should have access to the life-changing power of a good, union job.We’re going to pass the infrastructure and build back better jobs bills in Congress to unleash massive investment in working people and build our country’s future.We’re going to keep pushing to update labor laws for this century. And with your help we will. We’re going to pass the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act.We’re building a bold, dynamic and inclusive movement to meet this moment. A movement that dreams big and takes risks and isn’t afraid to fail.We’re going to keep pace with changes in the economy and changes in our workplaces, especially as new technology is evolving and shaping our work.Let’s show the nation why the labor movement is the single most powerful force for progress in this country.Congratulations. Keep going. Keep up the great work. Our time is now.Thank you.

66,Shuler: Michigan Labor Is Showing the Union Difference,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-michigan-labor-showing-union-difference,10-20-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the Michigan AFL-CIO Convention:Hello Michigan!I am honored to be with you—even by video.Ron, I’m grateful for your dedication—thank you, to you, Daryl and the team for doing an incredible job leading the Michigan federation.And to all of you, thank you for your resilience.Our entire movement sees and feels the work Michigan labor does.This pandemic has been devastating.It’s pushed us to a breaking point.We’ve endured through uncertainty and made incredible sacrifices.I don’t know about you, but it makes me angry to see how corporations are taking advantage of our sacrifice, relentlessly pursuing profits, and we’re not going to take it anymore.We’re not going to tolerate unfair and unsafe working conditions.We are done with shrinking wages and benefits.We were, are, and will always be essential.And we deserve to be treated like it.We deserve a fair share of the profits we create.And every working person in this country deserves the life-changing power of a union.This is our moment.Workers are standing up and taking risks. People are reclaiming their power through their unions.Like the BCTGM Local 3-G members in Battle Creek, who are on strike against Kellogg.The Michigan AFL-CIO is providing organizing, communications, and monetary support.And the entire labor movement has your back.We are fighting back against outsourcing.We’re standing strong for the American middle class.We’re not letting corporations divide us.We will not accept a two-tier system that hangs the next generation out to dry.Tens of thousands of union members are taking action—there are 30 strikes happening in all parts of the country and across industries, right now.Together, we are showing every working person in this country what’s possible.As one united labor movement we are building pressure, growing power, and we are winning progress for working people.Like the Michigan AFL-CIO’s Fair Maps Project, to make sure we have a fair redistricting process.Just this month, UAW organized 350 new members at a ZF Plant in Marysville.The Michigan Nurses Association recently organized technicians at UP Health System-Marquette, with 92% voting yes.Because working people are looking at us and seeing the union difference.That’s how we build a bold, dynamic and inclusive labor movement to meet this moment.We are the counterforce to skyrocketing inequality.To remove the barriers people face when they try to join a union—like the fear of getting fired—we need the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act.We also need investments in working people and our communities.That’s why we fully support both the reconciliation and the bipartisan infrastructure bills.These are the biggest investments in almost 100 years—in infrastructure—manufacturing—supply chains.And it includes a key piece of the PRO Act: first-of-their-kind penalties for employers who violate our right to organize.This is the kind of bold plan that puts workers at the center of policy and will help us recover from the pandemic and decades of neglect and under-investment.Roads and bridges, airports and broadband, public transportation, railways and a modern electric grid.Plus paid family and medical leave, child care investments and universal pre-k—because care is also critical infrastructure.We need it for those sidelined by caregiving responsibilities during the pandemic.And we need it to make sure care jobs are jobs with good benefits and wages.This is our opportunity to create good, sustainable union jobs, revive American industries, and build back better in towns and local economies all over Michigan.This is our moment.There are game-changing opportunities on the table.So are you ready to organize like never before, to reach out and grab it?Workers out there are looking for hope and a better life.Let’s show them they can find it with the labor movement in Michigan.So keep it going.Keep up the great work. Thank you and I can’t wait to see where we go from here.Have a great convention!

67,Shuler: Georgia Labor Made the Difference in 2020,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-georgia-labor-made-difference-2020,10-18-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the Georgia AFL-CIO Convention:Hello Georgia, I’m Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO.I am so honored to be with you—even if it’s by video.Thank you Charlie (Fanning) and Yvonne (Brooks) and the entire team for doing a tremendous job leading the Georgia federation. I’m grateful for your dedication and for keeping the labor movement focused on delivering for working people.And to all of the leaders, delegates and activists: thank you for your resilience, your courage, and your perseverance.It was on full display during the 2020 elections right here in Georgia. I know you might get sick of us talking about it, but I’m going to talk about it again—because you organized, you mobilized. And working with our partners and allies, we got out the vote. And we delivered! People waited for hours in the middle of a pandemic to vote and we elected the most pro-worker president and vice president in history and a pro-worker majority in the U.S. House.But we weren’t done. We had to work overtime to flip the Senate.The Georgia AFL-CIO mobilized at lightning speed and led a broad coalition on the ground. Lit drops. Postcard writing. Phone banking. Text banking. You knocked on more than a million doors. Your work made an impact on Georgia’s voters and made the difference in the election.We defied the odds, elected two champions of working people in Senators Ossoff and Warnock, and tipped the balance in the United States Senate!And because of our hard work, we now have everything lined up.A pro-worker congress and White House.We have the highest approval rating among the public in over half a century.Workers are standing up and taking risks, in the workplace and in our communities.And Georgia is showing every working person in this country what’s possible when we stand together in solidarity.Through heat and torrential downpours BCTGM union members in Norcross stood on that picket line day in and day out—and won!You fought back against outsourcing—and spoke out for fairness and the future of the American middle class—and the entire labor movement and our allies were with you every step of the way.And look at the ripple effect—working people are taking collective action across the country:Kellogg workers striking for better pay and benefits and health insurance.60,000 film and television production workers bargaining for adequate sleep, meal breaks and living wages. It’s as if they’re fighting for the weekend all over again.And the members of our newest affiliate—the National Women’s Soccer League Players Association—are speaking out against harassment and abuse on the job, and mobilizing for a fair contract.This is how we win progress. We build pressure and momentum, and grow our power as one united labor movement.We need to keep our foot on the gas pedal. We are on the brink of historic investments with President Biden’s jobs bills.We’re talking trillions of dollars of investment in working people and our families.In infrastructure. Roads. Bridges. Waterways. Public transportation. Rural broadband.Job training and public education.Paid family and medical leave, childcare investments and universal pre-k—because care is also critical infrastructure.We need it for those who were sidelined by caregiving responsibilities during the pandemic.And we have to make sure care jobs are good jobs with family-supporting wages and benefits, because people caring for our children and older people should be able to do the work they love and support themselves at the same time.Everyone should have access to the life-changing power of a good, union job.So we are going to keep pushing to update labor laws for this century. We’re going to pass the PRO Act, and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act—because most public employees in Georgia right now are denied their right to collectively bargain for a better life.And right along with labor rights—we’re going to protect and expand our voting rights.Because both are fundamental to our democracy.Corporations attack workers’ rights to deny our voice in the workplace. Extremist lawmakers attack our voting rights to deny our voice at the ballot box.It’s not a coincidence. Where there are attacks on unions, there are attacks on the right to vote. And those attacks are targeted especially to hurt and disenfranchise people of color. We know why our enemies are trying to silence us, because unions and voting rights give us power.Georgia, you know this all too well.S.B. 202 was a targeted assault on the right to vote of Georgia’s working people of color.But we won’t let racist efforts deny us our rights—our freedom—or our power.We are building a bold, dynamic and inclusive labor movement to meet his moment. A movement that dreams big and takes risks and isn’t afraid to fail.A movement that takes a new approach to the enduring values of fairness, dignity and shared prosperity—where racial justice and gender equity guides everything we do.A movement that leverages our power to bring women and people of color from the margins to the center—at work, in our unions and in our economy.Georgia, in 2020 you showed the nation what we can do when we’re united.Now let’s show the nation why the labor movement is the single most powerful force for progress in this country.Keep going.

68,Redmond: Tennessee Labor Is Building a Better Society,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-tennessee-labor-building-better-society,10-18-2021,"Good morning. Thank you, Brother Dan (Flippo) for that warm welcome and your strong leadership of Steelworkers Region 9.President Vonda McDaniel of the Nashville and Middle Tennessee CLC—thank you for your hard work building the council’s capacity this year. And for your friendship and fellowship on the AFL-CIO Executive Council, and for your important work on the Racial Justice Task Force.Secretary-Treasurer (A.J.) Starling and the entire Executive Board, thank you for your leadership, activism and advocacy across Tennessee.And of course, I want to thank another fellow Steelworker, Brother Billy (Dycus). The labor movement is better off in this beautiful state of yours—thanks in large part to your vision and fierce determination.It is great to be here today.I’m blessed to be in this room with each and every one of you. Your dedication to improving the lives of working people is an inspiration. The work you do every day is the foundation for working people in Tennessee to build a meaningful life.And our work has never been so meaningful.200 miles down the road in Memphis, BCTGM members at the Kellogg’s cereal production plant are standing on a picket line—in all kinds of weather—standing together for better working conditions.These are the same courageous workers who worked long, hard hours, day in and day out—throughout the pandemic—to produce Kellogg’s products for American families.How did Kellogg thank them? By slashing holiday and vacation pay. Retirement benefits. Quality health care. By taking away the very things we need now more than ever.For some of those workers, this isn’t new. Kellogg pulled a similar stunt 7 years ago. They tried to cut pay and benefits back then and when they didn’t get their way, they locked out workers—illegally—for 10 months.The Tennessee AFL-CIO stood in solidarity with those Kellogg workers in 2014, and you’re standing with them again today.You’re showing the nation a united labor movement will never break!You’re showing the nation—despite some of the most anti-worker and anti-union laws in the country—we will not be denied our right to build a better society.A society where work pays. And workers are safe. Where healthcare is a right. And retirement security is a given.A society where unions are strong and free. And racism is rooted out once and for all.Our late, great leader and friend, Richard Trumka, said the American labor movement must be the tip of the spear in the fight against racism.He was absolutely right. There is no institution in America better situated to lead the charge.And President Shuler is putting racial justice front and center.We know how racial justice and economic justice are intertwined.And we know better than anyone how racism is used to divide working people.Dr. King said that labor and civil rights are the two greatest movements for change. The labor movement built the Black middle class. In auto factories and steel plants. We turned bad jobs into good careers.The civil rights movement protected the right to vote—a right being trampled on in states across the American South as we speak.Dr. King said the labor-hater and the race-baiter is a twin-headed creature, spewing anti-Negro epithets from one mouth and anti-labor propaganda from the other mouth.More than half a century later, that creature is still alive and well.And here in Tennessee that creature has one ugly head wanting to enshrine “right to work” in the state constitution. And the other ugly head banning schools from discussing the very concept of racism and bias in our nation’s history.These attacks are meant to silence us. Working people. People of color.Right to work is a direct descendant of Jim Crow. It is anti-democratic and has no place in our society, much less our constitution.And I have no doubt you will mobilize Tennessee’s working people and beat it back next fall.And knock out Governor Bill Lee and all the politicians who serve corporate interests.America’s labor movement will not be silenced!Look what’s happening across the country right now. We’re rising. We’re striking. We’re working for a better tomorrow.Working people have had enough.Coal miners in Alabama.Nurses in Massachusetts.Steelworkers and Machinists in West Virginia.Distillery workers in Kentucky.Hospital workers in upstate New York.Ironworkers in Pennsylvania.10,000 John Deere workers in Iowa and Illinois.Working people are seeing the power of standing together.600 metal trades workers at Arnold Air Force Base went on strike in July and won a fair contract. Better pay, health care, disability benefits and dignity in the workplace.Right here in Nashville—following mass layoffs due to the pandemic—the Nashville Musicians Association came back and won a strong contract for orchestra musicians.And just this morning—the solidarity of more than 60,000 I.A.T.S.E. members brought some of the biggest Hollywood production companies back to the bargaining table and they won a fair contract! The film and television workers were negotiating for basic human needs. Like adequate sleep, meal breaks and living wages.You know when union members authorize a strike for the first time in its 128-year history, working people are fed up.America is taking notice of our collective action. And it is an education. Working people are waking up to the value and importance of labor unions.Brothers and sisters, a union job can be the difference. I know from experience.My three brothers and I grew up poor in Chicago. But then my dad took a job at an aluminum mill. It was a good, union job. And it changed everything.We had more security—opportunity—prosperity. We were on our way to a solid middle-class life.I followed my dad into the mill right out of high school. Got involved with the local. Attended meetings. Ran for shop steward. Then grievance chair. And ultimately I became president of the local.That good, union job made all of the difference for me too. It was my path forward. And it provided me with the opportunity to help improve the lives of working people.I suspect most of you here today carved a similar path. And for the same reason.We know the transformative power of a union job. It is life changing.More working people want that kind of change.Sixty-eight percent of Americans support unions. Nearly half of nonunion workers would join a union today if they could.But that chance to join one—to have that security and opportunity—protection from discrimination—equal pay for equal work—is being pushed out of reachby corporations who want to keep all the profits and power for themselves.They want to deny us a voice on the job.All so business can make another buck. They get a dollar. And we lose a dream.It has to stop.Everyone should have access to the life-changing power of a good, union job.So we are going to keep pushing to update labor laws for this century. That starts with the PRO Act. It is the key to our future and America’s future and the greater good.And right along with it, we’re going to pass the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act. Because most public employees in Tennessee are denied their right to collectively bargain for a better life.And right along with worker empowerment legislation, we’re going to protect and expand our voting rights.Both are fundamental to our democracy.We can make sure our elected leaders hear us and listen to us.Right now there are two important pieces of voting rights legislation in Congress. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and the Freedom to Vote Act. I understand Senator Schumer intends to bring the Freedom to Vote Act to a vote this week.This legislation would end racial discrimination in voting and will be a major step in restoring the balance of power to working people and our democracy.And that’s what we’re fighting for.Democracy for all.That’s what we voted for in the 2020 elections.That’s what workers are standing together for in 2021.And that’s what we’ll keep striving for today, tomorrow and every day.That is why we are here in Nashville. To strengthen America’s labor movement. To strengthen our democracy. And ensure every worker has a chance at a better life.Tennessee, you make America stronger.Thank you. Have a great convention and God bless.I’m going to stick around if you have any questions.

69,Shuler: SAG-AFTRA's Work Inspires Societal Change,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-sag-aftras-work-inspires-societal-change,10-16-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the SAG-AFTRA convention:Hello, SAG-AFTRA!I’m so thrilled to be with you at your convention. I’m beaming in from Newark, NJ, where we just did a big get-out-the-vote event with over 400 union members knocking on doors to make sure everyone votes. So I’m in a union hall—how perfect to have this knight over my shoulder?!We are grateful to be compatriots with you in this labor movement—to be there to support each other and learn from each other. SAG-AFTRA is such a leader and an innovator. It’s an honor to fight alongside you.Congratulations to President Fran Drescher; Executive Vice President Ben Whitehair; Secretary-Treasurer Joely Fisher; National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland; and all the newly elected national and local officers.This team, your dedicated staff, local leaders and member-activists are just incredible. And to Gabrielle Carteris, thank you for your many years of service and the bold voice you brought to our AFL-CIO table.Okay SAG-AFTRA members, if you only hear one thing today, I hope it’s this: THANK YOU.In the darkest days of the pandemic, through fear and uncertainty and isolation, you were, and continue to be, the voices and faces that bring us reassurance and hope.You keep us informed; you cheer us up; you entertain and inspire us; and you keep us connected.You’ve been such a lifeline for so many as we’ve endured, through uncertainty and loss.We’ve weathered extraordinary challenges since COVID hit.And SAG-AFTRA has been there, stepping up relentlessly for its members.You set the standard for how to get people back to work safely.Your collaboration with other unions and industry partners, you pioneered cutting-edge and common sense safety protocols that became best practices for others to follow.The initial Return to Work Agreement you brokered was historic.Those testing protocols, paid sick leave policies, and PPE requirements worked.SAG-AFTRA covered over 77,000 more jobs in the first four months of 2021 than in 2020, representing a growth of over $140 million in member earnings.And your latest Return-to-Work Agreement includes heightened safety and flexibility to adjust for the Delta variant.You’re constantly adapting to meet the unique needs of your members. I think about the Intimacy Coordinators who are safeguarding performers while also changing workplace culture. You’re always looking around the corner at the next innovation for your members.The union has become the center of gravity to grow connections among members, build and share the best practices and inspire action.That’s so important, especially for this unique moment we’re in. COVID has pushed us to a tipping point. Working people are fed up. They’re tired of being called essential one minute and then being disrespected and treated as disposable the next. There’s a nation-wide reckoning happening RIGHT NOW, and people are starting to see unions as a solution more than ever before.I’m sure you saw the latest Gallup poll on the public support of unions: 68 percent of people approve of unions—including 77 percent of young people.Why is that? We’re rising up and fighting back. And when one public radio station talks to another, when SAG-AFTRA union members go on Twitter and talk about the ways they’re standing up and winning, others see that and think, wow, I want to be a part of that—I need a union.And that’s why, since your 2019 convention, you’ve had so many public media organizing wins: WHYY in Philadelphia. WBGO in Newark. WAMU in D.C.Marketplace at the national level and so many more.Action inspires action. Solidarity grows solidarity. Workers are finding courage and taking risks.RIGHT NOW, over 100,000 union members are either on strike or about to go on strike across the country in all kinds of industries.And it’s amazing to see the solidarity of SAG-AFTRA members supporting their union siblings in all kinds of ways: walking picket lines, using their social media platforms to bring attention to bakery workers at Nabisco and Kelloggs in five states, auto workers at John Deere, distillery workers in Kentucky, hospital workers at Kaiser Permanente and of course I.A.T.S.E. which has authorized a strike with over a 90 percent turn out.That unity and solidarity—public support and activism—is fueling BIG momentum.The president of the United States is actually encouraging union organizing, using the bully pulpit and saying the “u-word”—union—everywhere he goes.And thanks to SAG-AFTRA’s tireless work, you won the critical relief for your members in the American Rescue Plan, that made sure your members weren’t short-changed on unemployment benefits.And right now, we are on the brink of passing long overdue, game-changing investments in working people and our communities with the reconciliation and the bipartisan infrastructure bills in Congress.These bills would be the biggest investments in American jobs EVER.Infrastructure is everything that connects us and enables us to go to work.Roads and bridges, airports and broadband, public transportation, railways and a modern electric grid.Plus paid family and medical leave, child care investments and universal pre-k.And as Fran taught us in her unforgettable role in The Nanny, care is also critical infrastructure—because care work makes all other work possible.We saw what happened during the pandemic when working people—mostly women—had to shoulder care responsibilities.1.8 million women were sidelined and without access to quality, affordable care. It’s taking women longer to return to the workforce because of it.And those who do the work in the care economy, overwhelmingly women of color, have been overlooked and underpaid.Care jobs should be good jobs with decent wages and benefits.The Build Back Better bill also includes a key piece of our labor law reform bill called the PRO Act. We were able to squeeze in first-of-their-kind penalties for employers who violate our right to organize. So when corporate union busters break the law and intimidate and harass workers who are forming a union, there will be real financial consequences!So this is it.We have so much opportunity ahead of us—it’s up to us to reach out and grab it.This is our moment to grow a bolder, more dynamic and inclusive labor movement.A movement that leverages our power to bring women and people of color from the margins to the center—at work, in our unions and in our economy.A movement that fights for the policies and changes that will make a tangible difference in people’s lives. Like you did with the new National Public Radio contract that includes pay raises, 20 weeks of paid parental leave, and tangible diversity, equity, and inclusion commitments.The contracts you negotiate and the work you do has such a powerful impact—the content people see on TV, what we hear on our podcasts and audiobooks—that inspires societal change.What we see and hear should be authentic—it should reflect the full diversity of this country and be inclusive.Racial and gender justice are critical for an equitable future—and for defining the future of work. Our economy is changing so fast, and we have to be nimble and adapt to meet the needs of the emerging workforce. Technology is being used to exploit workers in low-wage, on-demand platform work.The majority are women and people of color. And corporations are abusing loopholes in the law to misclassify workers and deny them basic rights.We can’t let new technology whittle away our wages, benefits, opportunities and safety. We want to be on the forefront of technological change and make it work for working people. To make sure our tax dollars that are underwriting scientific discoveries and tech breakthroughs are actually creating good paying jobs. We want a worker perspective and voice at every single stage of the innovation process and a seat at the table before, during, and as technology evolves and shapes our work.That way, we can actually co-create with it.We can get there through policy, training and bargaining—especially by bargaining ahead of tech, not just after the fact.Unions have always been innovators. We innovated the weekend. And we’re going to continue to innovate.Just look at Safe Place, the reporting platform available through the SAG-AFTRA app that makes it easier for members or anyone who has worked under a SAG-AFTRA contract to discreetly and securely report sexual harassment.That is exactly the type of innovation we want to see within our unions.And we want to innovate writ-large so we can organize and grow an even bigger, bolder movement.In fact, you probably heard we just added a new affiliate. The National Women’s Soccer League Players Association—our labor family is now 57 unions strong. They see the power of joining together with the broader labor movement as they fight back against harassment and abuse in their workplace, the soccer field.We are 12.5 million working people in jobs all across the economy. The labor movement is the most powerful vehicle for progress in this country.We want every working person to have a place in our movement.Together, we are a uniting and uplifting force for good.This is our moment.So keep it going, SAG-AFTRA.You are vital. You are visionary. And this has been an outstanding virtual convention.Keep up the great work.I can’t wait to see where we go from here.

70,Shuler Discusses Strike Wave with Business Writers and Editors,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-discusses-strike-wave-business-writers-and-editors,10-14-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared at the Society for Advancing Business Editing and Writing (SABEW) Future of Work Conference:Thank you, Dean (Murphy), for organizing this session, and Julia (Love), for that very kind introduction. I appreciate the opportunity to join you at this future of work conference. It’s a critically important topic and I’m looking forward to the conversation.Many of you have written about the labor market in recent months. And there’s a lot for assignment editors to explore: the pandemic, a change in administrations, our evolving relationship with the office, the Great Resignation, inflation.But while all these topics have raised new questions and challenges, what working people want remains fundamentally the same: Justice. Fairness. The right to organize, bargain and have our voices heard.So the title for today’s session is fitting. Workers are demanding more to rejoin the economy.As we are meeting right now, thousands of workers are on strike for a better deal and a better life.Coal miners in Alabama.Nurses and theatre techs in Massachusetts.Steelworkers and Machinists in West Virginia.Distillery workers in Kentucky.Hospital workers in upstate New York.Ironworkers in Pennsylvania.Kellogg’s workers in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Nebraska, riding the momentum of their compatriots at Nabisco, who recently went on strike in five cities and won better pay and more job security.Our newest affiliate, the National Women's Soccer League Players Association, is speaking out against harassment and abuse on the job, and mobilizing for a fair contract.35,000 workers at Kaiser in California have authorized a strike.And you may have heard just yesterday, the 60,000 film and television workers who make our favorite shows and movies announced they would walk off the job this coming Monday unless a fair contract is reached that guarantees adequate sleep, meal breaks and living wages.And early this morning, 10,000 UAW members at John Deere went on strike for dignity and security.Some have called this Striketober. I call it Exhibit A for why we need to rebalance the scales and put workers back in the center of our economy.The pandemic laid bare the inequities of our system. Working people refuse to return to crappy jobs that put their health at risk. Essential workers are tired of being thanked one moment and treated as expendable the next.Working people feel a new sense of power and leverage. They’re looking at work in a different way.Employers are starting to take notice. Some are raising pay and offering signing bonuses. Others are embracing justice issues to attract talent, focusing on environmental, social and governance, or ESG. You may remember a few years back when the Business Roundtable redefined the purpose of corporation, with a focus on stakeholders, not just shareholders.But too many businesses remain stubbornly focused on cutting labor costs, even after all that workers have done through this pandemic. And this focus on profits above all else comes at the expense of our economy, our democracy and ironically, their own bottom line and long-term sustainability.Right now, the United Mine Workers of America are going into their seventh month of strike at Warrior Met Coal in Alabama, and there still hasn’t been significant movement at the bargaining table. Those workers took pay cuts to get the company Walter Energy out from under bankruptcy five years ago—then, a consortium of private equity firms took over and their contract proposal back to the workers today doesn’t even get the pay back to level from five years ago.As the world economy emerges from the pandemic, Met Coal prices are skyrocketing. Warrior Met stands to make untold millions more in the next several years. It can easily afford a fair contract with its workforce.Even though Warrior Met stock is up since the beginning of the strike, it is weak compared to its competitors. Warrior Met stock is a bad investment, while the strike continues.Ending the strike is a win-win. It would help the investors, the workers and the community.And that’s the headline here. We don’t have a shortage of workers. The real scarcity story is a shortage of safe, good-paying, sustainable jobs.What are America's employers willing to do about it?Because workers are organizing for change. Unions are how Americans have always turned bad jobs into good jobs.My commitment as president of the AFL-CIO is to build a modern labor movement that can meet this moment. A movement that dreams big and takes risks and isn’t afraid to fail.A movement that is alive and well in Silicon Valley, the American South and all the places workers are trying to claim their share of the American Dream.A movement that takes a new approach to the enduring values of fairness, dignity and shared prosperity.A movement that leverages our power to bring women and people of color from the margins to the center—at work, in our unions and in our economy.And a movement that is ready to get to the negotiating table with employers and work out a fair deal that benefits everyone. Business. Labor. Our communities.This vision guides everything we do, whether it’s giving workers a voice at Amazon or co-creating technology to empower working people—whether it’s enshrining labor laws for this century by passing the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, or whether it’s pushing our elected officials to get President Biden’s Build Back Better jobs bills across the finish line.We have everything lined up. A pro-worker administration and Congress. 68 percent support for unions—including 77 percent among young people—the highest marks since 1965. And workers all across the country standing up, speaking out and taking risks.So this is our moment. We have a window. A historic opportunity. And we cannot and will not let it pass us by.Thank you. I look forward to your questions.

71,Shuler to Metal Trades: We Need Worker Voice in Innovation Process,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-metal-trades-we-need-worker-voice-innovation-process,10-13-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the Metal Trades Department 71st Convention:Thank you so much, Jimmy, for your leadership and thank you to the Metal Trades Executive Council. It’s great to be with you, even if it’s in a hybrid meeting. It’s been a real study in how we change with the dynamics around us.The MTD knows a little bit about evolving and changing—when you look over the 100 year history, you’ve confronted so many challenges and some incredible breakthroughs.I was looking at the agenda, you have quite a docket of fantastic speakers. What an honor to have Vice Admiral Galinis speaking at this 71st convention.It’s a testament to how the metal trades have always been vital to national defense.And with actor Steve Schrippa—and Heisman Trophy winner Gino Torretta—you can see the strength of our solidarity.That’s part of the reason this is such a remarkable moment.We’ve been weathering decades of offshoring and outsourcing.Under-investments starving our communities.Corporate greed has chipped away at workers rights.Technology is evolving and changing our work and the economy.And the only reason we’re getting through the worst ever public health crisis is because working people have stepped up. Your members have stepped up.So we are at a tipping point.This is our moment.This is our chance to put power on the side of working people by building a bold, dynamic and inclusive labor movement.To make progress for racial justice, gender equity, for working families and our communities through the economic power of good, union jobs.That’s why people are looking to us, the labor movement, for solutions and to find hope.68 percent of people support unions—including 77 percent of young people.And all across the country, people are speaking up and taking risks to reclaim their power through unions.That includes thousands of working people on strike.They’re fighting for the future of the American middle class, for fair contracts with better wages, benefits, and working conditions—and to keep jobs in the United States.Coal miners in Alabama.Nurses in Massachusetts.Steelworkers and Machinists in West Virginia.Distillery workers in Kentucky.Ironworkers in Pennsylvania.And 60,000 IATSE members, the working people who make our favorite television and movies, have been bargaining, took a strike authorization vote last week, and just announced today that they are prepared to go on strike on Monday.At the same time, we have a pro-union administration actually encouraging organizing.And thanks to the pro-union leadership of Majority Leader Schumer, we’re on the brink of passing historic jobs bills.These are game-changing investments that are going to create millions of jobs—including more than half a million manufacturing jobs.They’re going to update our infrastructure. We need infrastructure passed now—our roads and bridges, water systems, electricity grid, public transportation and education have been waiting too long.In every conversation I have, I point out that infrastructure jobs are absolutely jobs for women.And our training investments provide pathways into high quality jobs across sectors including manufacturing.Through our apprenticeship programs, the labor movement is the bridge to those high-growth, high-demand jobs.And we are laser focused on recruiting women, people of color, veterans, and the formerly incarcerated.This is our opportunity to grow.Everyone included. No community left behind. American-made industries—American supply-chains.High labor standards on every tax dollar invested in construction with PLAs and Davis Bacon protections.And as new technology is evolving and shaping our work—worker perspective and voice in every step of the innovation process—from discovery and development to application.About 100 years ago, the Taylor System was an idea of scientific management that took all the thinking and expertise away from workers.But the Metal Trades Department pushed back and the Taylor system was abandoned in gun factories and shipyards.Similarly, today, we don’t want technology built without worker voices, we don’t want it to be used to replace or exploit us.We want to co-create with technology and we want the power to bargain about how it’s used in our workplaces.And we want the benefits of our investments in science and technology to be widely shared.So we are going to keep pushing to update labor laws for this century.Everyone should have access to the life-changing power of a good, union job.That means removing barriers like the fear of getting fired when we stand together in unions.That means passing the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act right alongside it.And we are going to protect and expand our voting rights.We are going to put an end to wage theft, the shadow economy, and the practice of misclassifying us as contractors to deny us our rights.The path to citizenship is long overdue.A worker-centered democracy depends on our rights at the ballot box and in our workplaces for everyone who lives and works here.As one united labor movement, we are such a powerful force for good.We fight for every single working person in this country.We are THE engine that will move our country to a secure and equitable future.So thank you Metal Trades Department!Congratulations on your 71st Convention!Keep it going. Keep up the great work.I’m so excited to see where we go from here.

Kennedy Family and Hines for investing in and developing high-road projects like this one. This partnership makes our communities healthier and stronger.And, most importantly, I want to thank you, my brothers and sisters, for sharing your lunch break with us. The work you do every day is a testament to the quality and value of union construction, and will be for generations to come.It’s good to be back home. In one of America’s great labor cities.I grew up not far from here. My parents moved up to Chicago from the Mississippi Delta to build a better life. But it wasn’t easy. They worked hard. Long hours. They had an unbreakable work ethic, but still we were poor. We went to the free clinic. We lived on food stamps.Then my dad got a job at the Reynolds aluminum mill in McCook. It was a good union job and it changed everything. We had more security—opportunity—prosperity. No more trips to the free clinic. No more food stamps.Every worker should have the chance at a good union job. That’s why the work of the Building Investment Trust is so important.It is an investment vehicle for pension plans that creates quality union construction jobs. Working people investing in working people. All while offering the more than 250 pension funds invested in the BIT a strong return on investment, spurring economic development in cities like Chicago.Investments in projects like this one at Wolf Point doesn’t just transform skylines. It transforms communities. It transforms lives.In Chicago alone, construction investments made by the BIT has:In all, these investments have supported nearly $4 billion of total economic benefit.This is the power of connecting labor’s capital to the broader community.When labor and community work hand in hand, we create more security. More opportunity. More prosperity.And we forge the kinds of partnerships that will pay dividends for years to come. For America’s working families, our communities, and for the greatest of cities.Thank you.

Thank you, Lisa (Matthews), for that very kind introduction. I also want to thank the Headliners Committee for organizing this event and Jamie Horwitz for all of your support.To the journalists who make the Press Club a national institution, keep our country informed and strengthen our democracy: thank you. I have great respect for each of you.And I especially want to recognize the union members who have traveled to be here today.Corey Upchurch of AFSCME Local 1959, who makes sure special needs students get to school safely here in the District.Rochelle Ramsey Walker of the International Union of Painters and Verlissa Taylor of the Laborers, who remind us of the importance of investing in infrastructure, and that women build this nation.McCall Zerboni, a union member and professional soccer player, who I will say more about in a moment.And Keith Bragg and Darlene Carpenter of Bakery Workers Local 358 in Richmond, Virginia, who took on Nabisco and won.In recent weeks, more than 1,000 workers went on strike at Nabisco’s bakeries and distribution centers.Nabisco and its parent company Mondelez had threatened to ship good union jobs to Mexico if the workers did not agree to major concessions, despite record corporate profits. These are the workers who made the snacks that got us through lockdown during the pandemic—the Ritz crackers, the Oreos. Let’s admit it—they were double stuffed.I had the privilege of walking the picket line with Keith, Darlene and the other union members in Richmond. The company tried to pit workers against each other by offering a two-tiered health care system that weakened coverage for new hires.The answer from the union was a resounding no. To quote Keith and Darlene: “We don’t sell out our young workers. We are fighting for the next generation.”WE DON’T SELL OUT.Many of you have written about the labor market in recent months. There’s a lot for assignment editors to explore: the pandemic, a change in administrations, the return to office debate, the Great Resignation, inflation.But while these forces may present new questions and challenges, the stakes remain fundamentally the same: Justice. Fairness. The right to organize, bargain and have our voices heard.One of the most persistent questions reporters have been asking is: Are people refusing to work? An NBC headline in June put it this way: Is it a sluggish labor market—or workers positioning themselves for better opportunities?The answer to that question can be found in workplaces and communities across America. As we gather here today, thousands of workers are on strike for a better deal and a better life.Coal miners in Alabama (UMWA).Nurses in Massachusetts (MNA).Steelworkers and Machinists in West Virginia.Distillery workers in Kentucky (UFCW).Hospital workers in upstate New York (CWA).Ironworkers in Pennsylvania.Kellogg’s workers in four states, riding the momentum of their compatriots at Nabisco (BCTGM).And at this moment, the 60,000 film and television workers (IATSE) who make our favorite shows and movies are bargaining for adequate sleep, meal breaks and living wages. They’re ready to strike if necessary. 35,000 workers at Kaiser in California (UNAC/AFSCME, OFNHP, USW, UNITE HERE) have made the same declaration.Some are calling this Striketober. I call it Exhibit A for why we need to rebalance the playing field and put workers back in the center of our economy.The headlines reporting a shortage of workers are missing the point.The pandemic laid bare the inequities of our system, and as we try to get beyond COVID, working people are refusing to return to crappy jobs with low pay. Essential workers are tired of being thanked one moment and treated as expendable the next.The real headline isn’t that there’s a shortage of people willing to return to work. The real scarcity story is the shortage of safe, good-paying, sustainable jobs.And the good news is that workers feel a new sense of power and leverage and aren’t willing to settle anymore. And the solution, once again, can be found in the labor movement.Unions are how Americans have always turned bad jobs into good jobs.My focus as president of the AFL-CIO is building a modern labor movement that can meet this moment. A movement that dreams big and takes risks and isn’t afraid to fail.A movement that is alive and well from Silicon Valley to the American South to all the places workers are trying to claim their share of the American Dream.And a movement that leverages our power to bring women and people of color from the margins to the center—at work, in our unions and in our economy.Our newest affiliate, the National Women’s Soccer League Players Association, is showing us what a modern labor movement looks like. They are using their platform to speak out against harassment and abuse on the job.Kaiya McCullough recently wrote about her experience playing for the Washington Spirit, where she was bullied, intimidated and emotionally abused by management. There were racist and degrading nicknames. And so she cut her rookie season short. She didn’t feel safe. Playing the sport she loved at the highest level was no match for the league’s toxic culture. Across the NWSL, outrage built, and the players said no more and refused to play until the league was held accountable. This is just the beginning of these phenomenal women exercising their power.McCall Zerboni, a midfielder for the New Jersey/New York Gotham, is one of those women. Thank you for joining us today, McCall. The AFL-CIO is committed to building a professional sports world with more leaders like you and less people like Jon Gruden.This solidarity guides everything we do, whether it’s taking on Amazon or co-creating technology to empower workers—whether it’s enshrining labor laws for this century by passing the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act—or whether it’s pushing our elected officials to get President Biden’s jobs bills across the finish line.We have everything lined up. A pro-worker administration and Congress. 68 percent support for unions—including 77 percent among young people—the highest marks since 1965. And workers all across the country standing up, speaking out and taking risks. They see unions as the answer.So this is our chance. We have a window. A historic opportunity. And we cannot and will not let it pass us by. Thank you. I look forward to your questions.

74,Shuler: CLUW Is Standing Up for Democracy,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-cluw-standing-democracy,10-7-2021,"AFL-CIO President delivered the following remarks as prepared at the CLUW Biennial Convention.Thank you so much, Tarn, for that wonderful introduction, my IBEW sister. It has been a joy working alongside you and watching your leadership in the IBEW! Elise, thank you and CLUW national officers.Good afternoon everyone! It is such a thrill to be with you and feel the power of the working women in our movement. The labor movement is the largest organization of working women in the country—6.5 million strong! And the work CLUW has done to grow that activism and leadership is inspiring.I am so excited to be joining you today, with such a powerhouse lineup of leaders—too many to mention but a phenomenal group of women (and men) who are relentless champions for women and working people. Fighting for gender equity and building power in the workplace.When we come together at these conventions, we network with each other, share our stories, and see examples of leadership that motivate the next generation of leaders—in the workplace, or even at the highest levels of our government.This is a critical moment for women—and for our labor movement—to stand up for democracy and fight for the values we share and the country we love—as you did at last weekend’s Women’s March.We are going to show up, stand up, and claim our power. We did in 2020—that was a year like no other for working women. We had a vision and we showed up.Women of every age and color and faith voted in record numbers to oust the most anti-worker and misogynistic president in American history—and elected the most pro-worker president in our history—and the first woman vice president ever.“First woman” has a nice ring, doesn’t it?We worked overtime to deliver a pro-worker majority in the U.S. Senate.And we voted in a pro-worker majority in the U.S. House—which includes a record number of women.One in four members of Congress are women, including 40 percent of Democrats. Thirty years ago when Representative DeLauro first took office, women made up only six percent of Congress.When women run for office and win—when union women run for office and win—when our voices are in the halls of power—we create the change we need.And we have a generational opportunity right now to do exactly that.There is so much opportunity in front of us.We’re mobilizing to pass the full Build Back Better agenda—infrastructure AND reconciliation—which together represent one of the greatest investments in working people AND working women in American history.So we can rebuild our roads and bridges. Make the investments we need in public transportation and clean energy and job training. And access to good, union jobs and middle class opportunities.And that includes paid family and medical leave, child care investments and universal Pre-K. Because just like roads and bridges, child care and elder care are critical infrastructure.1.8 million women were sidelined from the workforce during the pandemic to shoulder care responsibilities.Women lost almost a million more jobs than men—with Black and Latina women taking the greatest hit.Many women remain on the sidelines.But we all know this is nothing new.For far too long, women have been underpaid, undervalued, and expected to take on most of the unpaid work at home.But this isn’t just a women’s issue—it’s a fundamental economic issue impacting all working people.Building Back Better will put gender equity where it belongs: at the center of our economic recovery.Because a strong care infrastructure makes other jobs possible.And women who do the work in the care economy, overwhelmingly women of color, have long been overlooked and underpaid. Care jobs should be good jobs with livable wages and benefits.And we know the best way to raise wages, close wage gaps and fight discrimination on the job is with a union card.It’s still true. A woman’s place is in her union. And in her union’s leadership. And in elected office. At all tables of power—everywhere decisions are made.In America—long before women had the right to vote—women organized unions.Many were young, immigrants, poor, discriminated against.More than twenty-thousand joined the “Bread and Roses” strike in 1912—coming together for their rights as workers—and for their right to dignity on the job, as women.Generation after generation, women have organized for better lives.But our right to organize has been obliterated over decades of attacks by the wealthy and powerful.That’s why we need to pass the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act so the millions of women who want to join a union can, without fear, without retaliation. Without having to risk getting fired.I’d like to take a moment and tell you the story of our incredible union sister with ATU, Latonya Robinson.Latonya is a proud bus operator for DASH in Alexandria, Virginia.In 2018, DASH was the last non-union transportation system in the D.C. area.At the time, two of every three DASH operators were working overtime to pay the bills. And one in every three had to work a second job to get by.Despite these tough conditions, management threatened to cut the end-of-the-year bonus–a bonus working families relied on for the holiday season.Latonya and her co-workers were done. Fed up. Fired up. And they were going to do something about it.So they organized—and voted 97-13 to join ATU Local 689.Latonya was on the front edge of leadership during the organizing drive. coordinating the collection of the union cards, observing the vote and providing the support and strength the members needed.Two weeks later—guess what happened: She was fired—for a phony, made-up infraction.She told me she felt blindsided. Embarrassed. And that she wouldn’t wish the feeling on anyone.But the whole time, the union had her back. They formed a petition, found her a temporary job, and filed an unfair labor practice complaint.There’s a happy ending, and I’ll tell it to you in her words.To quote Latonya:“They did not forget me. They did not give up. And they got me my job back.”And when we pass the PRO Act, employers like DASH will be fined for the very first time. If you break the law, it is time for you to pay the price.No one—no one—should ever have to risk losing their job for sticking up for safe working conditions. For better pay. For a collective voice on the job.Latonya told me—during the organizing drive, and throughout the relentless union-busting and intimidation—she kept her favorite phrase close to her: “If you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything.”I don’t think there’s a better phrase to describe her bravery, and the bravery of all of us in CLUW.Union siblings—working women—around the country are Making. The. Difference.This week, the members of IATSE, the film and television production workers who make Hollywood happen, authorized a nationwide strike for the first time in its 128-year history.And the vote was nearly unanimous: Nearly 99 percent of members voted Yes—99 percent!This is what solidarity looks like. This is the power of collective voice.IATSE members—including its countless barrier-breaking union women—are speaking loud and clear: Enough is enough. The long and unpredictable hours, the insufficient pay, the toxic culture has got to go.Whether at the bargaining table or on the picket line, we’ve got their backs. No contract, no shows.And if collective voice is not enough to yield a fair contract, we need to stand together in collective action.Last month we felt the power of withholding our labor. BCTGM members—at Nabisco factories and warehouses across the country—stood together on the picket line for a fair contract—and WON!And this week, 1,400 courageous BCTGM members at Kellogg’s cereal production plants walked off the job for better working conditions.These are workers who—for more than a year throughout the pandemic—worked long, hard hours, day in and day out—to produce Kellogg’s products for American families.How did Kellogg respond? By slashing holiday and vacation pay, retirement benefits, quality health care—and threatening to gut communities by moving production and jobs overseas. All while raking in record profits.Working people are saying: Enough. Is. Enough.We’re seeing such an incredible wave of collective action, we should call this month Striketober.People are fed up. This is our time.Because there is power in uplifting wins for union women. I also have to share: Last week, National Public Radio’s union with SAG-AFTRA, called “We Make NPR,” announced an agreement on a new nationwide contract.Thanks to relentless collective action, 521 journalists, editors, producers, designers and more, won twenty weeks of fully paid parental leave—and 26 weeks of job protection for leave taken for the birth, adoption, foster or other placement of a child.And speaking of collective action, in September we welcomed a new affiliate to the AFL-CIO: The National Women’s Soccer League Players Association.I can’t begin to tell you how incredible these players are.Last weekend, they said no more—and refused to play games until the league assured them that those who perpetuated systemic abuse, harassment and assault were held accountable.And last night, I witnessed the power of collective voice first hand when I was there with the Portland Thorns players as they stopped play at the sixth minute during their game. They played on their terms, returning to the field after the complicit CEOs, commissioners and coaches resigned or were fired.Real change. It’s just the beginning of fixing a broken system that abused workers. And we will be with them every step of the way on this historic endeavor.This is how we build a bold, dynamic and inclusive labor movement—and CLUW will lead the way.So every working woman—from all corners of our diverse, incredibly talented workforce—can know the life-changing power of a union, and that collective voice, both at the workplace and the ballot box.We can do it, sisters. We have the vision. We will cast the votes. And it’s on to victory—to keep breaking barriers and glass ceilings.Thank you so much everyone. Let's have a wonderful convention!

75,Shuler: Ironworkers Are Setting the Standard,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-ironworkers-are-setting-standard,10-2-2021,"AFL-CIO President delivered the following remarks as prepared at the Ironworkers Women's Caucus:Thank you so much Eric—for being such an inspiration, and for being a change maker—you’re leading and we’re following. And I want to acknowledge the District Council of Southern Ohio and Vicinity, Local 22 and the other Locals that are having viewing parties. If we can’t be together, this is the next best thing. Vicky O’Leary, my shero—thank you for your incredible work you, Kristi and others have done to pivot since the situation in New Orleans changed our plans.To all the Ironworker Women tuning in virtually: thank you!This caucus is an incubator for the organizing and activism that’s moving women from the margins to the center in our unions, at work and in the economy.All across this country women are leading in so many ways.They’re out in front leading strikes and picket lines. And women are leading behind the scenes in workplaces all across the country.And we’re being recognized. All the courageous women who received meritorious service awards—congratulations Marty Brock!—and all the tradeswomen heroes award recipients. Such an honor to be here with you and lift up your success!Since the AFL-CIO is the largest organization of working women in the country—6.5 million and growing—it’s so inspiring to see women claiming their power through our unions.One of our superpowers is how we connect with each other.Vicki O'Leary has done some amazing work to launch the Lean In Circles community to help women succeed in the trades.It’s effective because it enables women to come together (even virtually via Zoom) to share strategies, improve their experiences at work and give them the tools to thrive on the job.That’s the type of innovation mindset we need.I see networking and building connections as the real power of this caucus.5 years ago, Ironworkers made history as the first building trades union to establish paid maternity leave. You set the standard and the example for other trades to follow.And less than one year ago we elected the most pro-worker administration—perhaps in history—thanks to your early and consistent support of President Biden and Vice President Harris.And now we’re on the brink of historic investments with the Build Back Better Agenda.Investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, supply chains and job training.Roads. Bridges. Waterways. Public transportation. Rural development. Public education.We want to make sure there are high labor standards on every tax dollar invested in construction with PLAs and Davis Bacon protections; worker perspective and voice in every step of the innovation process as new technology is evolving and shaping our work; and we need labor law reform, called the PRO Act in Congress, to make it easier to organize, so that jobs now—and jobs on the horizon in new industries—will be good, union jobs.Because we know, unions are the best way to close wage gaps and fight discimination on the job.There was a study done recently by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, and it shows that women covered by union contracts lost fewer jobs between 2019 and 2020 and the wages of Black women union members increased during that time.We need the PRO Act to remove barriers—like the fear of getting fired when we stand together with our co-workers and try to organize a union.The Build Back Better agenda moving through Congress includes a critical piece of the PRO Act—real penalties for employers who violate our rights to organize.In the past, men filled 9 out of 10 “traditional” infrastructure jobs.Not this time. Those infrastructure jobs we’re going to create—they are absolutely jobs for women.As Vice President Harris put it, “Hard hats are unisex.”That is important for a gender equitable recovery.So are investments in care—we need to treat it for what it is. Critical infrastructure that makes other jobs possible.1.8 million women were sidelined from the workforce during the pandemic to shoulder care responsibilities.This is a women’s issue, and it’s a fundamental economic issue impacting all working people.Many women remain on the sidelines of the job market.Others are turning to the gig-economy because, without child care, it’s one of the few accessible options. And corporations know this and exploit “flexibility” to push this unreliable and low-paid work.And women who do the work in the care economy, overwhelmingly women of color, have long been overlooked and underpaid.Right now, care workers are quitting, as one worker said recently because “The pay is absolute crap.” No one should have to sacrifice their health in this pandemic for a low wage crappy job that has no pathway to a better future.Care jobs should be good jobs with livable wages and benefits.To help women who’ve been sidelined—who want to get out of low-paid gig-work—the labor movement is the gold standard.Our apprenticeship programs are the bridge to high-growth, high-demand jobs. We put people on the path to the middle class.And we are laser focused on recruiting women and people of color.And you’re showing the country that unions are power for women at work—on the frontline—or those who’ve been sidelined—for the rising generation—and for the women who are worried about retirement.I want every working woman in every kind of job to see they can have a place in our movement.We are building a bold, innovative and inclusive movement.We are intersectional and one of the most powerful forces in this country—for racial justice, gender equity, democracy at the ballot box and in our workplaces—by connecting with each other.Ironworker women: thank you for leading the way. I can’t wait to see where we go from here!

76,Shuler: CSEA Makes Our Communities Stronger,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-csea-makes-our-communities-stronger,10-1-2021,"AFL-CIO President delivered the following remarks as prepared at the CSEA Virtual 111th Annual Delegates Meeting:Thank you Mary for your incredible leadership, and to Denise, Rich, Nicole and Ron, the region presidents and to all the delegates and activists. I’m so honored to be with you after you’ve had such an action packed week.After watching that opening video, I just have to thank you CSEA for your resilience and sacrifice throughout this pandemic.Your members have given so much. You’ve risked your lives. You’ve kept vital services running.We see the signs in people’s yards and windows, but I have to say you were, are, and will always be essential.And you continue to serve and strengthen communities all across the Empire State.Because CSEA leadership stepped up for CSEA members, other working people are starting to see the value of joining a union, too.They see that having a voice on the job means you can speak up for safety equipment and protections without fear of getting fired—and that by sticking together, we can make life better and safer for working people and our communities where we work.So the question is, what happens next?We are going to take advantage of this moment, and build a bold, dynamic and inclusive labor movement for the future.A movement that is transparent and accessible and welcoming of young working people.A movement that keeps pace with changes in the economy—like the she-session—the unequal impact of the pandemic on women.1.8 million women were sidelined from the workforce during the pandemic to shoulder care responsibilities. Many are still on the sidelines.Others are struggling in the gig-economy because, without child care, it’s one of the few options available with their schedules—and the companies take advantage and use “flexibility” as a way to push this kind of unreliable, low-paid work.And women who do the work in the care economy—yes it’s overwhelmingly women, specifically women of color and immigrant women—have long been undervalued and underpaid.Right now, care workers are quitting, as one worker said recently: “The pay is absolute crap.”No one should have to sacrifice their health in this pandemic for a low wage crappy job that has no pathway to a better future.Finally, and most importantly, we are building a movement that puts women and people of color at the center.Because of the work we did in 2020, we are making progress on our Workers First Agenda.The American Rescue Plan was a big win. Under the leadership of AFSCME President Lee Saunders, we made funding for public services a centerpiece of our pandemic relief efforts.$350 billion for state and local governments. $12 billion for New York State alone. We are so powerful when we work together.We look forward to introduction of the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act. We’re going to use the full force of the labor movement to get that bill passed. And if that means getting rid of the filibuster, so be it.I believe we can accomplish anything when we work together. You showed that in the lead up to the Janus Supreme Court case, and in the days and months that followed.You are AFSCME strong. And your example will help guide and inspire as I take on the challenge of leading the AFL-CIO.This is a moment of incredible promise.Support for unions is the highest it’s been in more than half a century—68 percent, including 77 percent of young people.And along with the most pro-union administration actually encouraging organizing, and removing barriers to public sector unions, workers are speaking up and taking risks to reclaim their power together.You know why there’s a labor shortage? Because we are refusing to settle for less than our fair share.And like always, public service workers have been invaluable to our movement’s activism.You helped pass the New York Heroes Act—to create a new Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Standard to protect working people.And as we speak, we are doing everything in our power to get the Build Back Better agenda through Congress.It’s trillions of dollars of investments in our families and our communities.Roads, bridges and waterways. Rural broadband. Public transportation.Plus paid family and medical leave, child care investments and universal Pre-K—that is absolutely critical infrastructure.And for the first time, it will hold employers who try to bust our unions accountable, with real penalties. Not just a slap on the wrist, but real fines for breaking the law.Everyone should have access to the life-changing power of a good, union job.So we are going to keep pushing.We are going to keep organizing.We are going to keep thinking big and being bold and taking risks.To organize the unorganized. To win voting rights and immigration reform. To bring labor laws into this century.To build back better with unions.It’s there for us.We just need to reach out and grab it.Keep going CSEA members! Thank you and congratulations on your 111th Delegates meeting!

77,Shuler: Women Are Transforming the Labor Movement,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-women-are-transforming-labor-movement,10-1-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to WILL Empower:Thank you Sheri Davis, Lane Windham, Joe McCartin and Marilyn Sneiderman.It’s an honor to be here.I want to start by talking about what is owed Black women, Indigenous women and women of color whose stolen time and labor carried this country since before it was a country.In 2020, women of color were again the most reliable pro-worker voters and are stepping up as pro-worker candidates.Women are the majority of front-line workers risking their lives to get us through this pandemic.So much more is owed than just saying thank you.We need to dismantle systemic racism and inequality.Essential jobs are paying poverty wages, a shadow economy is exploiting immigrants, and missing social infrastructure is denying women equal pay and generational wealth.That’s why women are speaking truth to corporate power and protesting in the streets.Women are catalyzing transformation through the labor movement.I knew I wanted to be part of our movement when I saw how my mom and the women we worked with—clerical workers at Portland General Electric—how the women were treated differently. They didn’t get the same respect as the power linemen who worked in the field. The difference? The men—and they were all men—they had a union.That’s how I got my start: by mobilizing and organizing for equity.And I’ve reached this leadership point through a simple but important strategy: working with and standing on the shoulders of the women in our movement.I would not be here without that network of support. Women who lift each other up and help each other step into leadership roles.That’s one of the powerful ideas behind WILL Empower.And I promise you this: We are building a bold and inclusive labor movement with women of color at the center.Because we owe women, especially women of color, power and leadership in all its forms—out in front, leading strikes and marching on picket lines—and demanding change behind the scenes in workplaces all across the country.And leadership development work is THE critical foundation to opening the floodgates to the change we are all hungry for. We at the AFL-CIO are excited to be partnering with WILL Empower, and use an intersectional lens to our leadership development work and explore issues of race, gender, and other identities to help further our thinking around what inclusion looks like.We want to discuss roles and traditions and how we define leadership and change the definition of what leadership looks like that has kept women and people of color on the sidelines. Pounding a lectern or pounding your chest or pointing a finger at an elected official. We want a more expansive model of leadership.WILL Empower is building pipelines and support structures, part of the infrastructure to grow an inclusive, bold, and transformative labor movement.Infrastructure is everything that connects us. It’s what makes going to work possible.Just like roads and bridges, child care and elder care are critical infrastructure.My sister April Sims will say more about it.But 1.8 million women were sidelined from the workforce during the pandemic to shoulder care responsibilities.This is a women’s issue, and it’s a fundamental economic issue impacting all working people.Many women remain on the sidelines.Others are struggling in a gig-economy because, without child care, it’s one of the few accessible options.Corporations know this and exploit “flexibility” to push this unreliable and low-paid work.The solution to the child care crisis is not new: During World War 2 the U.S. funded universal child care so mothers could fill factory vacancies. In 1971 Congress passed universal child care legislation that was vetoed by President Nixon. We can fix this—and the labor movement will be the force behind solving it.And it’s unacceptable that women who do the work in the care economy, overwhelmingly women of color, have been overlooked and underpaid. Care jobs should be good jobs with livable wages and benefits.The more women lead, the more we organize, the more leverage we have to win progress.In fact, the labor movement is the largest organization of working women in the country.We’re 6.5 million strong. And growing. Women are on track to be the majority of union members by 2025.I want every woman in every type of job to see they have a place in our movement. Women covered by union contracts lost fewer jobs between 2019 and 2020 and the wages of Black women union members went up.We are growing our power as one of the most powerful forces—for racial justice, gender equity, democracy at the ballot box and in our workplaces—by connecting with each other.I’ll leave you with this—if you’re watching, and you’re thinking about stepping up into leadership—or you’re not, because you’re saying, I’m not “qualified” enough yet—I want to encourage you to think again. Because while you’re talking yourself out of it, there’s a guy right next to you, who is less qualified, saying, “Yeah, I can do that!” Take that next step even if it might make you uncomfortable—the labor movement needs you.Thank you, WILL Empower. I can’t wait to see how far we go from here. Thank you!

78,Shuler to RWDSU: Amazon Election Was Just the Beginning,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-rwdsu-amazon-election-was-just-beginning,9-29-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to the executive board of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU-UFCW):Hello everyone. I wish I could be with you in person. But I’m proud we’ve been nimble, we’ve adapted and expanded the ways we connect throughout the pandemic—so I’m thrilled to join you, even if it is by video. RWDSU is such a leader in innovating and this board, your dedicated staff, local leaders and member-activists are just incredible.Stuart [Appelbaum], you’ve been a champion for working people throughout this pandemic and a source of strength and a thought partner as we chart a path forward at the federation.And Jack [Wurm], thank you for your trusted leadership, and your dedication, Joseph [Dorismond].RWDSU has been there through it all. Through attacks on our democracy, a global pandemic with no leadership from the last administration, the trauma of structural racism and sky-high inequality, RWDSU leadership and members stepped up.And they are still stocking, feeding, processing, distributing, nursing, caring, supplying, serving and in so many ways, lifting up our communities. Because of it, the working people who for so long have been overlooked are now being recognized as heroes. RWDSU members were, are, and will always be essential. But now the rest of the country knows it too. And people in other industries are starting to see the value of joining a union. They see that having a union means a stronger voice on the job, that you can speak up without fear to get the safety equipment and protections you need in the workplace during a pandemic, and that you can make change by sticking together. And that’s why support for unions is the highest it’s been in half a century—68 percent, including 77 percent of young people.And along with the most pro-union administration actually encouraging organizing, people are speaking up and taking risks to reclaim their power through unions.And the pandemic has made the union difference crystal clear. Better pay, benefits and working conditions. During COVID, it’s been life-saving. We’re also connecting the dots that unions are one of the most powerful ways to fight discrimination at work and guarantee equal pay. RWDSU has been lifting up the vital work your members are doing and introducing a new generation to the power of organizing. You captured the nation’s imagination with an organizing drive in the Deep South, where the racist strategy of dividing Black and white workers is alive and well with right to work laws.The campaign at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, is having a ripple effect. Thank you Randy [Hadley] and the mid-south council and the entire RWDSU organizing team. I had the opportunity to meet some of the courageous workers who stood up and captured the world’s attention.And that campaign was about so much more than one company. It was about fundamental power, inequality and racial justice.About a labor movement that's innovating and organizing to take on issues like data collection, and making progress in the long march for civil rights.It wasn’t the end, it was a powerful beginning.And when Data for Progress polled folks about it, they found something surprising. As expected, voters have an unfavorable view of Amazon because of its union-busting tactics. Voters are on the side of workers who want to form a union. And voters support the PRO Act.  But here’s the surprising part: The majority of voters even said they’re now less likely to give Amazon their business.And no doubt, this fight isn’t finished. In August, the NLRB hearing officer recommended a new election at Amazon in Bessemer. Wherever the path ahead may lead, the entire labor movement has your back.We know progress doesn’t happen overnight. And the workers at Housing Works in New York know a little bit about that. The case workers, social workers, healthcare and retail employees, and maintenance and legal staffers walked off of the job, marched to the Brooklyn Borough Hall and raised their voices about low pay, poor health coverage and high caseloads. And more than a year later, thanks to the steadfast support of RWDSU, those employees voted to stand together in a union. An overwhelming 88 percent voted to join, and now they’re part of the RWDSU family.  We’re celebrating that major victory and cheering you on as you make your way through the first contract negotiations.There was another major win for working people in the Empire State with the passage of the New York Heroes Act. You fought for that—to create a new Airborne Infectious Disease Exposure Prevention Standard to protect working people.That’s such a good example of how we organize and advance policy at the same time. Because it’s not one or the other; to build power, it’s both.It’s how we grow a bold, dynamic and inclusive labor movement into the future.A movement that is transparent and accessible and welcoming of young working people.A movement that innovates to keep pace with a changing economy, like the Great Resignation where a record number of people are quitting jobs.A movement in every sector and every community, with women and people of color at the center.It sounds a little corny or cliché, but we are truly in  a unique moment—some people call it an inflection point—between our time-honored traditions and our cutting-edge future. And if you think about the institutions in this country, we are the single most powerful vehicle for progress in the United States.To grow that power, we have to organize at every level. And RWDSU is not afraid to take on those challenges and innovate organizing breakthroughs, try new things and keep learning from workers.And speaking of organizing and innovation, I want to shine a spotlight on Action Builder—I know many of you are familiar with it and you used it in the field during the Amazon campaign—it’s a digital organizing tool.How we developed it is groundbreaking. We didn’t just purchase a tool and say here, use this. We brought unlikely people with different skills and approaches to one table.The AFL-CIO partnered with affiliated unions including RWDSU. We listened to your needs. And now we have a tool that’s democratizing organizing, making it more accessible for people historically on the margins—women, people of color, young people and people who have never organized before.That sort of organizing power coupled with opportunities we have through investments are how we reach a whole new level.The Build Back Better investment agenda moving through Congress as a reconciliation bill will be game-changing.It has a key part of the PRO Act—penalties for employers who violate our right to organize. And you know first hand how that will make a difference.This package of investments is going to create good, union jobs and the infrastructure we rely on to go to work, including critical care infrastructure. These investments have been decades in the making. And this is just the beginning. Because everyone should have access to the life-changing power of a good, union job. So we are going to keep pushing to update labor laws for this century.We are going to protect and expand our voting rights. We are going to put an end to wage theft, the shadow economy and the practice of misclassifying us as contractors to deny us our rights. The path to citizenship is long overdue. There is no economic justice when the people who build, serve and feed this country are disenfranchised.A worker-centered democracy depends on our rights at the ballot box and in our workplaces.As one united labor movement, we build pressure and we grow power. Together, we are an uplifting force for good. And the progress we make makes things better for every single working person in this country.So keep it going. Keep up the great work. I can’t wait to see where we go from here. Thank you.

79,Shuler: Colorado Labor Is a Powerful Force for Good ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-colorado-labor-powerful-force-good,9-24-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks by video to the Colorado AFL-CIO Convention:Hello Colorado—I am honored to be with you—even by video. Josette [Jaramillo], my sister—I’m grateful for your dedication, you, Mike [Williams], Dennis [Dougherty] and the team are doing a tremendous job leading the Colorado federation. And to all of you, thank you for your resilience. Through rain and heat BCTGM union members in Aurora stood on that picket line day in and day out and won!You fought back against outsourcing and spoke out for fairness and the future of the American middle class and the entire labor movement and our allies were with you every step of the way. Together, we showed every working person in this country what’s possible when we stand together in solidarity. Thank you for your courage and perseverance. As one united labor movement we build pressure, grow power and we win progress. And now the Colorado AFL-CIO is leading within a broad labor coalition to claim organizing rights for more than a quarter million working people. Right now, most public employees in Colorado are denied the right to bargain for a better life. But you’re building on legislative successes for state workers, firefighters and agricultural workers. And teachers, social workers, sanitation technicians, health care workers in public hospitals, parks and recreation staff, librarians and so many more working people will benefit. Keep going. We are with you every step of the way. Together, we are such a powerful and uniting force for good, all across this country. And we are building a bold, dynamic and inclusive labor movement to meet this extraordinary moment. 
 
We’re already reaching into new industries and sectors. And I am so thrilled to say we recently added a new affiliate. With the National Women’s Soccer League Players Association...our labor family is now 57 unions strong.Every working person in every kind of job can have a place in our movement.  
 
And when I say we’re building a dynamic movement I mean we’re going to keep pace with changes in the economy—like the she-session—the unequal impact of the pandemic on women. And the Great Resignation—month after month, people are quitting jobs. And changes in our workplaces, especially as new technology is evolving and shaping our work. The pandemic sped up rapid changes that companies had already been planning. HelloFresh, a tech startup from Germany, is now the largest meal-kit delivery service in the U.S. During the pandemic, they doubled revenue and their executives profited. But employees struggled to make ends meet and stay safe at work. A pallet recently fell on workers in Aurora, two were sent to the hospital with serious injuries. That’s why more than 1,000 HelloFresh kitchen factory workers in Colorado and California are organizing with UNITE HERE.But the union-busting consultants the company hired are already holding mandatory anti-union meetings. One of these firms is known for spreading conspiracy theories. Most workers at HelloFresh in Colorado and California are people of color, so this organizing drive is also about racial justice. As a movement, racial justice and gender equity are guiding everything we do, including organizing.  Unions are one of the best ways to close pay gaps and fight discrimination on the job. And to remove the barriers—like those union-busting consultants—we need the PRO Act, and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act. Right along with labor rights, we are prioritizing expanding and protecting voting rights.Because both are fundamental to our democracy. There is no economic justice when the people who build, serve and feed this country are disenfranchised at the ballot box and at our workplaces.That’s why we need a path to citizenship! And we’re fighting to keep that in the budget reconciliation package being debated right now in Congress. 
 
And also in that package is President Biden’s Build Back Better agenda, trillions of dollars of investment in working people and our families. With roads, bridges, public transportation and education. High labor standards on every tax dollar invested in construction with PLAs and Davis-Bacon protections. Paid leave and investments in the care economy, because care is also critical infrastructure. We need it for those sidelined by caregiving responsibilities during the pandemic. And we need it to make sure care jobs are jobs with good benefits and wages.Care workers are quitting, as one worker said recently because “The pay is absolute crap.” No one should have to sacrifice their health in this pandemic for a low wage crappy job that has no pathway to a better future. We also want to grow our pre-apprentice and apprenticeship programs, because we know, our training programs are the gold standard and pathway to high-growth, middle class careers.Congress is considering Build Back Better right now. But anti-worker special interests are trying to chip away at these critical investments. We won’t let them succeed. We won the election and we voted for this agenda. This is it. This is our moment. We have everything lined up right now. We have the highest approval rating in over half a century. Workers are standing up and taking risks, in the workplace and in our communities. And we have the most pro-union administration in history. I know you. I know our federation. And I am so hopeful for the future. Just imagine what it’s going to be like when we empower every working person in this country with a good, union job.  Getting there depends on all of you. And what you do in these next days and weeks. So keep it going. Keep up the pressure and hard work.Thank you Colorado labor!  And have a great convention!

80,"Shuler: The Labor Movement Is the Engine Toward an Equitable, Clean Energy Future",https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-labor-movement-engine-toward-equitable-clean-energy-future,9-21-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared to close the Climate Jobs National Resource Center's second annual virtual Climate Jobs Summit:Thank you so much, Vinny [Alvarez], you have shown incredible leadership and such a source of inspiration. And thank you to our friends at the Cornell Worker Institute. And what an honor to follow Secretary Walsh. I am so proud that you are our Labor Secretary—a card-carrying union member leading the Department of Labor!  As was said, I’m Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO. We are now 57 unions and 12.5 million working people in jobs all across the country.What’s clear from the incredible conversation today is this: we can respond to the climate crisis and preserve and create high-quality, union jobs at the same time. I will say it loud and clear: the path to a clean energy future runs right through the labor movement. We’re building an energetic, resilient and inclusive movement in every ZIP code, in every state—with women, Black, brown and Indigenous folks, and LGBTQ individuals at the center. 
 
We heard speakers discuss a wide range of exciting, critical policies and technological advances. And the common thread running through each possibility is working people and our communities.That is exactly the framework we need for an equitable clean energy future: Working people at the center of the discussion and driving action on climate change, all while reversing deep-rooted inequities.Working people are already stepping up in the face of climate change: Fixing our grids, protecting forests, maintaining buildings and roads, building carbon-free healthy schools, evacuating subway stations, providing care relief and more. All working people are affected by the climate crisis. And the labor movement is responding, as we heard today, from Connecticut, Texas, Rhode Island, Maine, Illinois, and of course, New York! We’ve seen what happens when worker voices and perspectives are excluded—we get bad policy and legislative decisions. But we have the chance right now to do things with a better approach, to enact climate and energy policies that prioritize workers, uphold labor standards like Davis-Bacon, encourage apprenticeship utilization and prioritize domestic manufacturing. Our former President Rich Trumka and I talked about this all the time.As most of you know, we lost Rich unexpectedly in early August.One of the last speeches he gave was at a workshop through the Labor Energy Partnership—a joint effort of the AFL-CIO and the Energy Futures Initiative.The workshop focused on keeping and creating good, union jobs in the Ohio River Valley—the region where Rich was born and raised, a third generation coal miner.It’s where his roots with the Mineworkers started. He always talked about the bosses at the mines who thought they could deny workers our rights and about the inequities in those rural communities. Rich used the union to put power behind workers’ voices. He wanted every working person, on every job, to have that power of a union too. And I believe his very last speech was a message of solidarity to striking miners down in Alabama. I mention this because even in his last moments of leadership, Rich was standing alongside workers in coal communities who will be on the frontline of this transition, and he was standing with workers who are designing the clean energy future already. That’s what our movement will continue to do.A successful transition depends on support for workers in industries that are changing—like guaranteeing wage replacement for those who are displaced.It depends on creating jobs and opportunities within communities impacted by the clean energy transition and environmental degradation.That means identifying local job-creating investments before existing jobs are lost and lifting up policies that push investments to fossil communities and underserved communities.And it means organizing the renewable sectors. As John Doherty spoke so eloquently about, workers need the power to come together and bargain. But right now, it’s easier for a corporation to stop a union than it is for a worker to join one. So most renewable energy jobs are not organized, pay a fraction of what existing energy jobs pay, and don’t offer benefits or retirement security.That’s why we need the PRO Act—renamed the Richard L. Trumka PRO Act—because it will remove barriers to organizing. We also need more job training opportunities that actually lead to careers and build a new, inclusive middle class. Our apprenticeship programs in the labor movement are the gold standard—they are the bridge to high-growth, high-demand job and we are laser-focused on recruiting women, people of color, veterans and the formerly incarcerated.
 
A number of communities in New York have booming pre-apprenticeship programs, like Opportunities Long Island, which has a strong record of placing women and people of color in the Building Trades.Last Friday, I heard of an Opportunities Long Island graduate, Claude Malloy of Ornamental IronWorkers Local 580, who said: ""The day I was accepted is the day my life changed. The program gave me hope again.”We want anyone looking for that kind of hope to be able to find it through our movement.And with 68 percent of all Americans supporting unions, and 77 percent of young people, unions are the place where workers from one sector can shift to another without leaving their community or losing good wages and benefits. Where leaders turn for American, union-made supply chains to support green infrastructure and manufacturing. Where we revitalize manufacturing as we grow the renewable sector, and amplify worker voice and perspective so we benefit from investments paid with our tax dollars. And where responding to the climate crisis means addressing systemic discrimination and economic inequality.We have the unique network to do it—the AFL-CIO can mobilize working people in every state and every city in the country, across party lines and lived experiences. Because of it, the labor movement can be the engine that propels us to an equitable, clean energy future.Thank you to all of today’s participants, especially our labor leaders Becky Pringle and Randi Weingarten; the Worker Institute at Cornell University ILR School; Michael Fishman, Climate Jobs NY and the Climate Jobs National Resource Center; Chris Shelton, John Doherty, John Podesta, Vinny Alvarez, Kyle Bragg and Secretary Walsh, and so many others.  And thanks to all of you out there watching! The AFL-CIO is thrilled to help lead this urgent and hopeful movement.

81,Shuler: We Need a Path to Citizenship,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-we-need-path-citizenship,9-21-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks as prepared at a citizenship rally and march in Washington, D.C.:I’m Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO.  We are 57 unions with 12.5 million working people in jobs all across the economy and we come from countries all around the world. Together, we can defeat the forces trying to keep us divided and poor.We have an economic system that treats immigrants as an exploitable subclass. It lets employers use immigration status as a tool to keep workers from organizing. That hurts every working person in this country. But it doesn’t have to be that way.Our immigration system should lift up standards, wages and rights for all working people. That’s why we need a path to citizenship. We are all connected through work, and since COVID hit, our connections are stronger, deeper and crystal clear: There will be no recovery when millions of workers are forced into the shadow economy. There is no economic justice when the people who build, serve and feed this country are disenfranchised at the ballot box and at our workplaces. Every working person in the U.S. should have access to the life-changing power and protection of a good job and the status to stand up freely for their rights at work. Immigrants and refugees were, are, and will always be a vital part of our workforce, our movement and our democracy. So we’re putting Congress on notice: no excuses. Get citizenship done so we can truly build back better for all!And now, frontline hero and member of UNITE HERE, my union brother, Aschalew Asabie.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

82,Shuler: Good Union Jobs Are Key to a Clean Energy Future,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-good-union-jobs-are-key-clean-energy-future,9-17-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks virtually at the Long Island Offshore Wind Supply Chain Conference:Thank you so much for that wonderful introduction, Congressman [Tom] Suozzi. Thank you for your strong voice for working families in your district but for all working families, and for chairing the House labor caucus.Good morning to all of you! Even though I’m Zooming in, I’m so happy to be joining you today—sounds like you have a great crowd in person and online. Hello to my labor friends—John Durso, Roger Clayman. I heard Chris Erickson is there and everyone from all walks of life who care about our climate.I got fired up hearing your intro Congressman. I’m inspired because I see the future: that win-win-win is right there for us to grab it, and a modern, resilient and inclusive labor movement is what will help us meet the challenges of the climate crisis.New York, I don’t need to tell you that working people are seeing and feeling the impacts of climate change. Ida recently flooded the New York transit systems and parts of Long Island saw record rainfall. It’s happening all across the country. Wildfires. Heat waves. Climate change is already here, happening in every community and every ZIP code. From your local news reports to the recent IPCC report, you’re hearing the alarm: we have to transition to a clean energy future. The question is how? The answer: with good, union jobs. It’s why we are building a labor movement that will meet the moment.Just look at how our movement, government, industry leaders and environmental groups have worked together to bring offshore wind to the Atlantic Coast. Our progress working together shows that the way to respond and adapt to the climate crisis is through a high-road strategy with good, union jobs. That’s the only way we can meet the urgency in front of us. Because our response to the climate crisis also needs to address the unacceptable inequality in our society and it has to contribute to racial equity, and be conscious of the people and places that are affected by these changes. And unions are the most powerful vehicle to deliver that progress across the board. When you look back at the early days of energy jobs, unions transformed low-wage, dangerous work in the carbon economy, industry by industry. We challenged the inhumane conditions and the relentless pace of production and made those jobs into good careers—with wages and benefits to support a family. That’s how unions built America’s middle class. So now the question is who will build and benefit from this next transition—the clean energy transition? It can’t be like it was in the past when working people suffered and were left stranded.The opportunities of the clean energy transition are opportunities to create good, union jobs that will benefit local communities here in the U.S. for generations to come.That’s what we mean when we say that the energy transition depends on a high-road and high-wage strategy. The emerging offshore wind industry in the U.S. is a major frontier for clean infrastructure and for growing domestic supply chains, too. From raw materials to offshore wind turbines and the components of those turbines we can make those here in the U.S., and as offshore wind continues to scale up, we have to make sure that the jobs scale up with it and we are creating union jobs in the United States.Offshore turbine manufacturing can create a lot of jobs, but it’s not just the nacelles, the generators, blades, foundations, substations, cable and vessels. Offshore wind turbines are so massive, that the bill of materials is incredible—imagine if we made those materials here! It takes hundreds of tons of steel and copper and specialty metals to build a single offshore wind farm. That is why reshoring and growing the American supply chain can be such an engine for economic growth.The number of small parts that goes into each component is very large. That is a huge opportunity for small manufacturers on Long Island and across the region. You think about the companies with sophisticated processes that have been in the fabricated metals space, aerospace, specialty electronics and other sectors, they are great candidates to supply the offshore wind sector. This is an historic strength of your economy.We see the potential and are already leading in the offshore wind sector, of course here in New York and in New Jersey, but also Massachusetts, Virginia, Rhode Island, Connecticut and more. And Maine and the West Coast will be next with floating wind in deep water.Just this month, construction began at the New Jersey Wind Port, the first facility purpose-built for staging, assembling and manufacturing related to offshore wind projects on the Atlantic Coast. That project has the potential to create hundreds of union construction jobs in the area and the groundbreaking ceremony included the signing of a project labor agreement between AECOM Tishman and the United Building Trades Council of Southern New Jersey, AFL-CIO. It’s so exciting to see so many of these projects already underway. The work is being done. We’re beyond the call to action. It’s all in motion and labor is not only at the table, we’re leading the way. The Long Island Federation of Labor alone has been building local movements and coalitions to support offshore wind for over a decade!In Rhode Island, workers in the building trades unions built Block Island Wind Farm, the first successful offshore wind farm in the U.S. We did it with a high-road strategy alongside the developers. I know many of you here were involved in that project. In Virginia, a high-road, high-wage partnership between offshore wind developers and labor is on track to be a model to replicate in other renewable industries and in other regions across the country.And here in New York, we’re seeing so many signs of progress and it is inspiring, we can do this. Building the state coalitions with stakeholders—labor, business, community and environmental groups to boost investment. Building support for the industry through the lease and permit process. Lifting up the Opportunities Long Island pre-apprenticeship program to make sure economic development provides long lasting careers and grows the middle class in local communities. This is so important for our economic recovery, especially for a gender equitable recovery. Because women lost almost a million more jobs than men due to the pandemic, with Black and Latina women suffering the greatest job losses.Our apprenticeship programs are the bridge to high-growth, high-demand jobs. And we are laser focused on recruiting women and people of color. And highly-skilled union labor is the best way to ensure clean-energy projects are safe and successful.  I know you’re also planning a National Offshore Wind Training Center so working people can earn a Global Wind Organization certification This is a perfect example of partnership, bringing together the Long Island Federation of Labor; the Building and Construction Trades Council of Nassau and Suffolk Counties; IBEW; Utility Workers Local 1-2; Suffolk Community College; the BlueGreen Alliance; and Ørsted and Eversource.And working with unionized manufacturing firms, academic institutions, the state federations and local representatives from key energy-related affiliates, we will make real progress around building a domestic, union-made supply chain.This is how the labor movement will continue leading the response to climate change through high-road economic development because we know what it means to build and reimagine the future. The foundation of our movement is solidarity. The threat of a changing climate will impact all of us, brothers, sisters and siblings. No community is safe from this existential threat of climate change, until every single community is safe. And putting racial justice and gender equity front and center.Today, I am thinking of Long Island’s own Tony Mazocchi, a labor leader who spearheaded a renewed call to action both for environmental justice and for occupational safety. He spoke out about the health problems workers faced from handling harsh chemicals and connected the dots and knew the environment would be damaged by them, too. He was one of the first to talk about solidarity between the labor and environmental movements; he saw that they had a shared root problem of big corporations putting profits above the health of workers and communities. In Tony’s words, we are here to struggle together for the “best aspirations of working people.” To me, that encompasses what a union-built clean energy future means. We know what solidarity looks like, the power it can hold to change entire systems for the better. This is the moment to grow and leverage our solidarity. The path to a clean energy future runs right through our labor movement. Thank you all for laying the foundation for offshore wind projects and with them a growing middle class on the Atlantic Coast. Not only will your work have ripple effects in this region and in the offshore wind industry, but it will be a blueprint for other parts of our country and other renewable energy sectors, too.I am with you in solidarity for the long-run. Thank you!

83,Shuler: Minnesota Labor Is Committed to Racial and Economic Justice,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-minnesota-labor-committed-racial-and-economic-justice,9-16-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks by video to the Minnesota AFL-CIO Convention:Hello Minnesota—I am honored to be with you—even by video.
 
Thank you for your leadership, Bill [McCarthy] and Brad [Lehto].
 
The theme of today’s convention is Solidarity. That’s so important. Because solidarity is our power as a movement. Solidarity is how we won the weekend—a labor innovation that makes life better for everyone. And solidarity is how we are going to build a bold, modern, inclusive labor movement.
 
This is the tipping point. Extremist lawmakers are attacking voting rights. Corporations are denying workers’ rights to join a union. Inequality is at a record-high. CEOs are making 299 times what the average worker does. There is one organization that can mobilize in every state, catalyze change and balance the scales.   It’s us. Our labor family of 56 unions, 12.5 million working people in jobs all across the economy.The progress you’re making in Minnesota is part of the progress we are making, together, as one united movement. And our innovation and progress makes life better for every working person in this country. So we need to put the age-old tactic of division behind us. A century ago, we let racism divide us. That's how right to work laws were created. Racism hurts all of us. Not just workers of color.And immigrants pushed into the shadow economy; women paid less for equal work; people of color forced by systemic racism into unreliable, low-wage jobs. These are economic conditions that hurt all working people. The way we reverse these inequities is through the solidarity of the labor movement. We are women, people of color, immigrants, the differently abled, veterans, the LGBTQ.We are the only organization that represents and speaks to people across all party lines and lived experiences.That’s why the Minnesota AFL-CIO is recommitting to racial equity and putting racial and economic justice at the core of your 2021 legislative priorities.
 
Racial justice means George Floyd and Daunte Wright would still be alive. 
 
We need reforms to our systems of justice and politics, workplaces and economies. 
 
We took an important step with our national blueprint on policing. We are empowering officers to break the blue wall of silence, call out bad behavior of fellow officers and hold them accountable. 
 
But that’s one small step in the fight to end systemic racism—we have a lot more to do.
 
We’re going to continue to confront racial oppression, extremism, bigotry and disinformation that threatens democracy.
 
We are going to bring women and people of color and immigrants from the margins to the center at work, in our unions and in our economy. 
 
And we will use our collective voices, actions and bargaining power for racial justice, gender equity, a path to citizenship, voting rights and to make sure every working person in this country has access to the life-changing power of a good, union job. 
 
This is our chance. The public is with us. An overwhelming majority—68 percent of Americans and 77 percent of young people—support labor unions. Workers are standing up and taking risks, in the workplace and in our communities.The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation is organizing the beverage sector. With UNITE HERE Local 17 organizing campaigns at breweries and distilleries.And we have the most pro-union administration in history. We can empower millions of people who want to join a union by passing the Richard Trumka PRO Act and a national public sector PRO Act.  
 
Look at the good we’ve already done: Minnesota labor reached each corner of the state by driving actions for the PRO Act. While Teamsters were locked out, you coordinated solidarity pickets, boycotts, held food relief events for striking families, and pushed city and state governments to help get a fair deal. The Hospitality and Event Workers Relief Fund was a lifeline for displaced workers. The Saint Paul Regional Labor Federation conducted an absolutely massive food delivery operation.

I am so hopeful for the future. Keep going. Keep up the great work. Our time is now.Together, as one united labor movement, we are the single most powerful force for progress in the United States. In solidarity! Thank you Minnesota labor!

84,Shuler: Nebraska Labor Has a Culture of Activism,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-nebraska-labor-has-culture-activism,9-16-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks by video to the Nebraska State AFL-CIO Convention:Hello Nebraska—I  am honored to be with you—even by video.Sue [Martin], my sister—I’m grateful for your dedication, you’re wearing so many hats and doing an outstanding job leading the state federation. And to all of you, thank you for your resilience. Our entire movement sees and feels the work Nebraska labor does.This pandemic has been devastating.And the anti-worker governor and legislature in Nebraska has made it so much worse for working people, our families and communities who are still on the frontlines fighting this virus. At first, the governor wouldn’t even designate us as essential. That meant no hazard pay. No paid time off to take care of ourselves or our families. No guaranteed safety measures like contact tracing. They even stopped publicly reporting case numbers.Nurses worked without PPE. Teachers worked overtime adapting to hybrid teaching. And meatpacking workers faced deadly conditions in COVID hotspots.Companies handed out hair nets and cookies instead of setting up sanitizing stations. Workers were forced to breathe through dirty, blood-soaked masks. And the state legislature still voted down coronovarius protections for meatpacking workers for the rest of the year.Through all of this—because of this—you were not resigned. You organized into action. You brought powerful worker testimony to the State Capitol from meat processing professionals.You showed up in the rain for UFCW Local 293 to pressure Smithfield Foods, a company that refused to negotiate COVID protections.You shared worker stories on Facebook and delivered letters to the offices of Senators Sasse and Fischer urging them to pass the Richard L. Trumka PRO Act. We need the PRO Act and a national public sector PRO Act right alongside it. Because today, it’s easier for corporations to stop a union than it is for a worker to form one.But we know unions are the best way to win safety protections, guarantee equal pay and fight discrimination at work. With the PRO Act, more women can close pay gaps and win benefits like paid family leave through a union contract. With the PRO Act, workers who’ve been disenfranchised can reclaim power, win better working conditions and protections, and those workers as we know are mostly women of color, immigrants and refugees. Many are undocumented. In January, the governor actually said undocumented workers would not be eligible for the COVID vaccine. All workers lose when any of us are treated as a disenfranchised subclass. We cannot recover as long as frontline workers are forced into a dangerous shadow economy. We need a path to citizenship.We need to keep going to win our Workers First Agenda. That includes every working person in this country. No one left behind. We know you’ve been building a culture of activism and organizing. You’ve been working to foster a coalition of unions, worker centers and community groups. And by showing up—raising our voices—you are strengthening our entire movement.We’re building on our proud traditions and the progress made by local legends and leaders like Albert {Bauer], Jody [Monahan] and John [Kretzschmer]. They’ve earned their places in the Labor Hall of Fame. And we’re going to support the next generation of labor leaders.We are building a bold, modern and inclusive labor movement to meet his moment. Every working person in this country should have access to the life-changing power of a good, union job. This is our chance to make it a reality. We have everything lined up. The public is with us. An overwhelming majority—68 percent of Americans and 77 percent of young people—support labor unions. The highest approval ratings in over half a century.Workers are standing up and taking risks, in the workplace and in our communities. And we have the most pro union administration in history. We can create good, sustainable union jobs. We can revive manufacturing, grow new industries, adapt to climate change with resilient infrastructure and build back better with unions in towns and local economies all over Nebraska.We need infrastructure investments, worker voice and high labor standards on every tax dollar invested in construction with PLAs and Davis Bacon protections.Women lost almost a million more jobs than men, with women of color suffering the greatest job losses. So many were sidelined to take on the burden of care.A real recovery means gender equity. So those infrastructure jobs are absolutely jobs for women.We need to invest in care infrastructure. Just like roads and bridges, affordable and accessible child care and elder care enable us to go to work. 
 
And finally, we need to protect democracy in our workplaces and at the ballot box. That means expanding voting rights. Because this isn’t just about unions. It’s about fairness, it’s about the fundamental economic power of working people in the United States.Every time you ask your elected politicians to support the PRO Act and other priorities in our Workers First Agenda, you’re standing up for all working people and you’re sending a message.Working people made this country. Working people are carrying this country. And working people belong at the center of the national conversations and policies that keep our country running. I know you. I know our federation. And I am so hopeful for the future. The labor movement is the single most powerful force for progress in this country.Keep going. Keep up the great work. Our time is now.Thank you Nebraska labor and have a great convention!

85,Shuler: Transport Workers Are Leading the Way,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-transport-workers-are-leading-way,9-13-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler's remarks as prepared to the Transportation Workers Union 24th International Convention:Thank you so much for that thoughtful introduction, Alex [Garcia]. Thank you to everyone putting in the work to make this convention possible. John [Samuelsen], Jerome [Lafragola], Curtis [Tate], Mike [Mayes] and Alex, thank you for your dedication and leadership. And to members of the Transport Workers Union, thank you for your resilience.Our entire labor family of 56 unions, 12.5 million working people in jobs all across the economy, see, feel and benefit from the work TWU does. And I want you to know we will never, ever forget those who've died on the frontlines.
 
As a movement, in such a short period, we’ve experienced so much loss. President John Sweeney, Larry Willis—many more union siblings, community members and loved ones. And my friend and partner, President Richard Trumka.You know that Rich was absolutely laser focused on the PRO Act. That’s why it’s so fitting that our friends in Congress are going to rename the PRO Act in Rich’s honor. We are going to pass the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act. We’re going to keep moving and the memory of all those we’ve lost will be there, with every step forward.  Please, join me now in a moment of silence in their honor.[A moment of silence is observed.] Thank you.The Transport Workers Union was born in the Great Depression in response to corporate greed—being underpaid, overworked, and mistreated in unreliable jobs. And in your 87 year history, you’ve met so many challenges and made just as many breakthroughs.During the Civil Rights movement, TWU members marched with Dr. King in Selma, Alabama. Local 556, representing Southwest Airlines flight attendants, won a four-month maternity leave for female employees and put an end to “hotpants.” Local 234 won breakthrough contract language against harassment.We just observed the 20th anniversary of 9/11—the loss and sacrifice of cabin crews, passengers and first responders—and how transit workers answered the call in the aftermath. And after decades of under-investment in our transportation systems, through the worst public health crisis in a century and no leadership from the last administration, you stepped up.You’re doing the frontline work that makes other frontline jobs possible. With dwindling revenue, public transit and Amtrak workers have kept our transit and passenger rail systems running.Every day, at least one transit worker is assaulted during their shift, yet bus operators and flight attendants continue to help people connect to their destinations.Pilots and flight attendants recently aided humanitarian efforts to transport Afghan refugees to the U.S.Through climate disasters, like Hurricane Ida that flooded the New York subway, TWU workers stayed up all night to escort passengers out of stations to safety.You were, are, and always will be essential. And now it’s time to shape our future.We are building a bold, modern labor movement. A movement that is transparent and inclusive and welcoming of young working people. A movement that keeps pace with a changing economy, the “She-session” and the Great Resignation. A movement in every sector and every community, with women and people of color at the center, where every working person has the right to a good, sustainable, union job.TWU is leading, with its commitment to equality in the workplace and investments in the next generation through the Future Leaders Organizing Committee. And thanks to John’s innovation as a leader, TWU has a culture of activism and organizing we want to see throughout the entire labor movement.Together, we will leverage our power for transformations.When CEOs are taking 299 times what the average worker earns as frontline workers are making poverty wages. And when people are working two and three jobs to make ends meet, when one job should be enough. The labor movement is the counterforce to that inequality. We will balance the economy.And we are the single most powerful vehicle for progress in the United States.If the question is how do we propel more people into middle-class union jobs, strong unions are the answer. The progress we make, as one united movement lifts up every working person in this country.We have everything lined up right now. This is our moment. The public is with us. An overwhelming majority—68 percent of Americans and 77 percent of young people—support labor unions. That’s the highest approval ratings in over half a century.People who have never thought about it before are starting to see that they’re working people, too. Working people are standing up and taking risks, in the workplace and in our communities. We have the most pro union administration in history. And with Rep. [Mark] Pocan leading our pro-union champions in Congress, this is our opportunity to invest in working people and the critical infrastructure we rely on to go to work.We need to invest in our transit and rail systems, airports, highways, bridges and tunnels, and our care systems, too.We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reverse decades of neglect, cut emissions, build climate resilience and create safer working conditions.We can build an Amtrak for this century and future ones. And by investing in our transit systems, we will create thousands of good paying, union jobs.Work connects all of us and these union jobs will empower other working people and their communities connected to the economic lifeline of safe and reliable transit.We want high labor standards, worker safety and to make sure we benefit from our taxpayer investments.We must end the dangerous foreign outsourcing of aircraft maintenance and more than that, let’s return foreign aircraft maintenance to the U.S.We have the most skilled aircraft mechanics in the world—this union built the gold standard for safe air travel—it is time to end the perverse policies that invite offshoring of these jobs and jeopardize the safety of the flying public.We need the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act. These bills will remove barriers like the fear of getting fired when we stand together with our co-workers and try to organize a union.Just look at bikeshare systems: TWU is doing outstanding work to organize this emerging sector. But despite taking public funding, management treats bikeshare workers as temporary, replaceable and non-essential, and they want to stop organizing efforts.The PRO Act would also put an end to the employee misclassification that platform companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have used to build their exploitive models. These companies spent $200 million to mislead California voters about misclassification. It’s part of a coordinated effort to undermine democracy at the ballot box and in our workplace. Thankfully, a judge just ruled Prop 22 unconstitutional.But we have to be proactive to prevent job-killing tech, from companies using technology to replace or exploit us. We have to ensure public funding isn’t undermining labor rights for public transportation workers and that we have a say in how technology is used. It’s a public safety issue—the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration just added the twelfth crash to its investigation of Tesla’s autopilot system.That’s why TWU is leading a groundbreaking campaign focused on the future of work. Your effort is on the cutting edge—you are doing what needs to be done to prepare for the future, to secure a voice at the bargaining table about how and when new technology is used in your transit and other workplaces.Change doesn’t come easy, but with a plan you can shape it. As new technology is evolving we want to get ahead of it as a movement. We don’t want technology to replace jobs or have Big Tech make all the decisions.We want to put worker perspective and voice in every step of the innovation process. We want technology to complement and support human beings who are doing the work. I think of this as collective creation—we can co-create with technology.I also want to applaud your efforts, working together with TTD, to build a strong, unified labor coalition around the future of both autonomous and electric vehicles, focused on good policies that address the entire supply chain, from workers in manufacturing to operations and maintenance.TWU is making it loud and clear—workers want progress but we want to shape our future. And we will work hard, dig deep and leverage the full might of our movement for our Workers First Agenda. Because this isn’t just about unions. It’s about fairness, it’s about the fundamental economic power of working people in the United States. And you are moving the American economy forward, keeping the travelers safe and putting power behind worker voice.I am so hopeful for our future. Our movement can build an America where every working person has access to the life-changing power of a good, sustainable, union job.Keep going. Keep up the great work. We’re just getting started. I am so excited to see where we go from here. Thank you, Transport Workers Union!

86,Shuler: BCTGM Strikers Are Heroic,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-bctgm-strikers-are-heroic,9-8-2021,"The following are AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler's prepared remarks to striking BCTGM members at Nabisco:

BCTGM! This is worker power. Right here. On this picket line. And in Chicago, Illinois! In Portland, Oregon! In Norcross, Georgia! In Aurora, Colorado! A thousand Nabisco workers. Standing up for what you deserve! And 56 unions,12.5 million people in jobs all across the country have your back! This is the labor movement!Are we going to let corporate greed take all the profit we helped create? NO!Are we going to let them upend our schedules and cut our pay? NO!Are we going to let them send more good, union jobs to Mexico? NO!Throughout the pandemic, you’ve stepped up. I know I’ve found comfort in the snacks you make. You were, are, and always will be essential. And for being here now, standing together against outsourcing—you are heroic. No one wants to go on strike. But you’re here for fairness. And the future of the American middle class. You deserve a fair contract with better wages, benefits, and working conditions! And to keep your jobs in the U.S.!For every working person in this country who wants a good, union job. For all the working people in other countries who are hoping for better. This is where pressure builds. This is where power grows. This is how progress is won.From the Warrior Met miners on strike in Alabama, to researchers organizing at the University of California and on Twitter, with celebrities like Danny Devito, we are with you in solidarity! The power we have when we move as one is unbeatable. So say it with me: No contract. No snacks. No contract. No snacks. No contract. No snacks! Thank you BCTGM, one day longer, one day stronger, the entire labor movement is with you every step of the way!

87,Shuler: Global Economy Must Work for Working People,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-global-economy-must-work-working-people,9-8-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks at the OECD 2021 60th Anniversary Ministerial Council Meeting:Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this important consultation ahead of the OECD ministerial. Secretary General [Mathias] Cormann, Undersecretary [Jose] Fernandez, TUAC and BIAC colleagues—thank you for your condolences. We are still grieving the loss of Rich Trumka and I know how much he loved participating in these meetings but the best way to honor him is to keep working together to build a robust OECD worker-centered policy agenda and strengthen working peoples’ bargaining power and working conditions around the world.The global labor movement knows trade is a vital part of a modern global economy. We also know the global economy must work for working people. The question is not whether trade and economic globalization are inherently “good” or “bad.” The question is: Will we craft trade policies that protect our environment and ensure working people receive a fair share of the gains from trade? Or will we continue the path of globalization policies that drive a race to the bottom in wages and working conditions, and exacerbate economic inequalities?Over the past 40 years, a harmful neoliberal “free trade” agenda was built on a false premise—that by protecting investors’ rights, expanding rules of law for business owners and lowering tariffs and expanding trade, that workers would benefit. We now know the reality was the opposite—under these neoliberal policies, workers suffered lower wages, reduced job and social security, and eroded rights. Current trade policies resulted in workers becoming poorer and weaker in relation to their employers. And workers’ rights and environmental protection were cast aside, branded as “non-trade” issues. This model has led to skyrocketing inequality, a backlash to globalization and increasing distrust in democratic institutions.We cannot downplay job losses or income losses or collapse of communities by saying “oh, people just don’t understand the true benefits of globalization.” What they understand is that job precariousness and economic uncertainty are their reality. To counteract it, respect for human rights and labor standards should be a precondition for any trade and investment agreement, and in a manner that makes them enforceable. Monitoring, complaint and sanction mechanisms involving social partners should become part of all trade and investment agreements. The USMCA free trade agreement recently helped protect freedom of association and collective bargaining rights in Mexico. This is an example of the policies we need. It’s time for a new model that promotes good jobs, high wages and sustainable economic growth, protects our environment, and respects human dignity world-wide.Workers need to be at the table at every stage of trade negotiations to shape these policies. We need to build on the USMCA free trade agreement that uses an enforceable labor mechanism to protect freedom of association and collective bargaining rights. The AFL-CIO and my colleagues at TUAC look forward to working with you to ensure a worker-centered trade agenda is more than a goal, but a set of real, transformative policies for working people.

88,Shuler Marks Labor Day at the White House,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-marks-labor-day-white-house,9-8-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks at a White House Labor Day celebration:Thank you so much, President Biden and Vice President Harris. You are leading the most pro-worker administration in U.S. history. And our labor movement is the single most powerful force for progress in the United States.In the past two centuries, industry by industry, in factories, mines and mills, we challenged inhumane conditions. We created safety standards. We transformed grim, dangerous work into good, sustainable union jobs. This administration gets it—that’s how unions built the American middle class.It’s what we celebrate on Labor Day. Along with working people who, through so many challenges, are still delivering, feeding, teaching, caregiving, cleaning, building, rescuing, serving and in so many ways, lifting up our communities.We were—are—and always will be essential. Labor Day was brought to you by the labor movement. Our innovations, like the weekend, make life better for everyone. And to meet this extraordinary moment we’re building a modern, inclusive labor movement.A movement in every sector and every community, with women and people of color moving from the margins, to the center. Unions are the best way to guarantee equal pay, close wage gaps and fight discrimination at work. We create pathways to the middle class for veterans, for those who’ve been sidelined, for everyone. The power of a good, sustainable union job is life-changing.That’s why an overwhelming majority—you probably heard this last week in the Gallup poll—68 percent of Americans and 77 percent of young people support labor unions. The highest approval ratings in over half a century.From tech to transportation to sanitation and more, working people are choosing to stand together in unions.Everything is lined up—we’ve got the public on our side, workers standing up and taking risks and the most pro union administration in history. This is our moment! And shame on us if we don’t take advantage of it. But with labor laws written in 1935 and the corporate attacks that have chipped them away over time, today it’s actually easier to stop a union than it is to form one.That’s why we need to pass the PRO Act—now named in Rich’s memory and called the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act—and we need the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act right alongside it.The PRO Act is the foundation of our Workers First Agenda. This is the worker-centered change we voted for in the last election and that this administration is delivering with the Build Back Better plan. So we’re putting everything we have into passing it. Every working person and every family in every state would benefit in some way. Child care tax credits, the first ever federal paid family and medical leave benefit. A long overdue path to citizenship. Infrastructure investments and apprenticeship programs. American-made industries, American supply-chains made with good, union jobs. That’s the Biden-Harris vision for America’s future.COVID-19, the climate crisis and technology have radically changed our lives and work. We are not going back to how it was before. I hear from working people all across the country: We won’t risk our lives in this pandemic for an unreliable, low-wage Job. Our system of care is broken and it should be seen as critical infrastructure. And we shouldn’t have to work two or three jobs to make it—one job should be enough.And it’s the labor movement that will lead the transformation. We are innovating and fighting for what will be the next weekend. And with the game-changing leadership of the Biden-Harris administration, we will build back better with unions. To win an America where every working person has the right to a good, sustainable, union job. And with it, access to an expansive, new American middle class.The labor movement is open for business. And we’re just getting started.Thank you.WATCH: President @LizShuler joined @SecMartyWalsh and @POTUS for a #LaborDay celebration at the White House this morning #1u >> pic.twitter.com/G3iBorcblY

89,Shuler to Virginia AFL-CIO Labor Day Breakfast: Voting Is Our Superpower,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-virginia-afl-cio-labor-day-breakfast-voting-our-superpower,9-6-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks to the Virginia AFL-CIO Labor Day Breakfast:Hello everyone, happy Labor Day! I’m zooming in from the road, talking to workers and heading to a canvass kickoff in a few minutesThank you for that wonderful introduction, Doris [Crouse-Mays]! My sister—who is a she-ro to me and so many. I’m grateful for your dedication and resilience, and you and Lorne [Seay] are doing a tremendous job leading the Virginia federation.Thank you for being here Senator Tim Kaine. As a co-sponsor and with your help, we are going to pass the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act.Governor [Ralph] Northam and Lieutenant Governor [Justin] Fairfax, we appreciate your partnership and leadership and signing all that progressive legislation and Lieutenant Governor Fairfax for breaking those tie votes.A big shout out to Chairman Bobby Scott who is a tireless champion for our Workers First Agenda. I constantly see and hear him lifting up working people in the U.S. House.Thank you Gayleen [Kanoyton] and the Hampton Democratic Committee for organizing the 12th year of this wonderful event. Jim [Avery], thank you. And Thomas Calhoun and the Eastern Virginia Labor Federation for your partnership. Here’s to 12 more!Your theme is exactly right: Voting is our superpower. We made that loud and clear in 2020. Union members and our partners and allies organized, we mobilized. We elected the most pro-worker president and vice president in history, a pro-worker majority in the U.S. House, and because we knocked on more than one million doors in Georgia, we won a pro-worker majority in the U.S. Senate! And we need to use that superpower again—right now—to elect our slate of pro-worker champions in Virginia. Terry McAuliffe as Virginia’s next governor. Hala Ayala as lieutenant governor. Mark Herring as attorney general. And two of our union family—Elizabeth Guzman (AFSCME) and Jeion Ward (AFT) for House of Delegates.All 100 Virginia House of Delegates seats are up for election this year. We don’t just want to protect the gains we’ve made—we want to go even further. This is a moment to think and act from a spirit of innovation and growth, and build back better. Everyone included. No community left behind. On a national level, we need the PRO Act and a national public sector PRO Act right alongside it to make sure jobs now, and jobs on the horizon in new industries, will be good, union jobs. We are one vote away in the Senate. We are counting on Senator Warner to join Senator Kaine and come through for us. Because we need the PRO Act to remove barriers like the fear of getting fired when we stand together with our co-workers and try to organize a union. We need the PRO Act to make sure the clean energy future and American innovation are union-made. And to lift up worker voice and perspective so that we benefit from our taxpayer investments. We need the PRO Act because the way we can absolutely build back better—keyword: better—is with good, sustainable union jobs.Just this morning, I was out at sunrise visiting union members working at Dulles Airport. Did you know workers from more than 44 local unions work at Dulles? Baggage handlers, pilots, cabin cleaners, ramp workers, check-point screeners, fuelers, flight attendants, food court workers, security officers and so many more. All dedicated to the safety of millions of travelers who arrive and depart through one of America’s busiest airports. I heard a lot about the issues on their minds—fair wages, benefits, and workplace safety protections—how that union difference is changing and saving lives.  That’s what we want for everyone: the uplifting power of a good, sustainable union job. That’s the goal we’re working toward as we build a bold, modern inclusive labor movement—bringing women and people of color from the margins to the center. Together we are the most powerful force for progress in this country. And unions are the counterforce to skyrocketing inequality. We balance the economy. And every working person in every type of job should have a place in our movement. The 2021 election is so important for the labor movement in Virginia and working people everywhere. Over the past two years, thanks to a pro-worker majority in the statehouse, Virginia’s lawmakers have been changemakers. Delegate Ward mentioned the Oxfam America report. They rank states on which is the best to work in and the results for 2020 just came in. Virginia jumped up dramatically 29 spots higher in the last year because of you—communities and workers organizing for policy changes that are centered on working people. In the past two sessions you’ve made so many pro-worker policy gains: Protections for domestic workers. You raised the minimum wage. You passed legislation to fight misclassification. Historic expansion of voting rights. That’s what we’re celebrating this Labor Day: generations of working peoples’ contributions to American prosperity to building the middle class, and this year, to our recovery.This election is about all of that and it’s a test for the 2022 midterms. And as you all know, one vote is all it takes. Everyone remembers 2018, when the outcome of the entire Virginia House of Delegates was decided by one vote—picked out of a hat! We can’t leave anything to chance.When working people vote, we all win. We win policies and investments and opportunities that create good, sustainable union jobs. Thank you so much and Happy Labor Day.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

90,Redmond on PRO Act: We Are In This Campaign to Win It,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-pro-act-we-are-campaign-win-it,9-6-2021,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks at a Labor Day PRO Act rally:Thank you, Fred [Yamashita]! Thank you, Juan [Padilla]! Thank you, Arizona! It is great to be at IUPAT! A powerful union. Happy Labor Day, everybody! Labor. Allies. Elected officials. Our friends in business. We are here today to celebrate workers. And that means passing the PRO Act. I said that means passing the PRO Act. Sixty-five percent of likely voters in Arizona support the PRO Act. Are you one of them? Do you support the PRO Act? Do you support the PRO Act?Our opponents got together for a press conference last week. Did you see it? It was full of fear. And lies. And propaganda. You know what that told me? They are scared. Sixty-eight percent of Americans support unions. That’s the highest mark since 1965! Our opponents know we have the momentum. We have the power. And we have the people! They want to keep all the profits and power for themselves. They want to deny us a voice on the job. They are counting on us to lose hope and walk away.Well I have a message for our opponents. AFL-CIO President [Liz] Shuler was here last week. I am here now. And we are going to keep showing up. We are going to keep stepping up. We are going to keep speaking out. We are going to set up shop in Arizona until the PRO Act is the law of the land! I don’t care how hot it gets. I don’t care how long it takes. We are in this campaign to win it! Did you hear that, Senator Sinema?Did you hear that, Senator Kelly?We gotta pass the PRO Act. For higher wages. And better benefits. For safe workplaces. Retirement. Protection from discrimination. Equal pay for equal work! And no more fear of deportation for immigrant workers.I know what it means to have a union. My parents were the children of sharecroppers. They were born in the Mississippi Delta and made the great migration up to Chicago in 1958. They came with very few belongings but a very strong desire to build a better life. My three brothers and I grew up poor. We lived on food stamps. My mother shopped at Goodwill. While we had little money, my parents were rich in love. In hope. In faith. In an unbreakable work ethic. My father took every kind of job he could find. He pumped gas, he was a janitor and he stocked shelves at the supermarket. My mother was a domestic worker. She woke up every day at the crack of dawn and took three buses to the far suburbs of Chicago to clean folks’ houses and cook their food. Every night she would sit at the foot of her bed and soak her feet and read her Bible. No complaints. No excuses.Then something big happened. Something that changed everything. That something was a union job. My dad started working at an aluminum mill outside of Chicago called Reynolds. He had that union job, and so we had more security, opportunity, prosperity. We stopped going to the free clinic. We got off of food stamps. We still went to our local Goodwill—only now, it was to donate clothes. This is personal to me. I want every worker to have that chance. I want every family to feel that joy. The PRO Act is how we do it!Let’s be real. Arizona passed right to work in 1946. It was passed to keep people who look like me out of the union. How can workers organize in 2021 under laws conceived in segregation? Right to work. Jim Crow. The filibuster. Immigrants working in the shadows. These are all tools designed to hold us down. And we must dismantle them piece by piece. Starting right here. Right now. No more captive audience meetings! No more firing workers for speaking out! No more companies refusing to bargain a first contract! The right to organize! The right to strike! The right to build a better life for ourselves and our families! Just like my parents did.Brothers and sisters, hear me loud and hear me clear: We are going to pass the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act!  Are you with me? Are you with me?Thank you! Happy Labor Day!

91,Shuler: Labor and Faith a Powerful Force for Progress,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-labor-and-faith-powerful-force-progress,9-5-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks at Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church:Thank you so much Reverend, Dr. Donaldson. I deeply appreciate that warm welcome and I’m grateful to you and First Lady [Kimberly] Donaldson. Congratulations on your fifth year of pastoring here at Mount Pleasant. And congratulations on 155 years of service and social engagement through the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church family—what a milestone.I am so excited to be here. I’m Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO. We are 56 unions with 12.5 million people working in jobs all across our economy, from nurses to bus drivers, plumbers and professional football players, and some of those union members may even be among us today.I’m here, the day before Labor Day, to talk about a shared commitment to justice for working people. Through the worst public health crisis in a century, the worst economy since the Great Depression—attacks on voting rights and democracy—working people stepped up. We are still delivering, feeding, teaching, care-giving, cleaning, building, rescuing, serving and in so many ways, lifting up our communities. And every working person should have access to the life-changing power of a good, sustainable union job.We want decision-makers and leaders to learn from the Baptist social teaching on the role of trade unions—that workers have the right to organize by a free and democratic process. Working people all across our country are choosing to stand together in unions to improve workplaces and working conditions because we care about each other, about the work we do and the people we serve.To quote scripture, from First Thessalonians, “Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.” That’s what a union does. And together, the labor movement and our faith partners are the most powerful forces for progress in the United States—not just for union members—for everyone. Industry by industry, sector by sector, in factories, mines and mills, we challenged the inhumane pace of production. We created safety standards. We transformed grim, dangerous work into good, sustainable union jobs. The pay, benefits and security of a good, union job are life-changing. And the best way to close wage gaps and fight discrimination at work is with a union card.That’s what we celebrate on Labor Day: The contributions of working people to American prosperity. And the innovations from the labor movement—like the 8-hour workday and the weekend and Labor Day itself—that raise the standards for everyone. Because this isn’t just about unions. It’s about fairness, it’s about the fundamental economic power of working people in the United States. It’s about the fundamental human right that all people are treated with dignity and respect in the workplace. It’s about progress like raising the federal minimum wage from the pathetic, current $7.25 to $15. If we did, it would be a raise for 40% of Black women. It’s about the entire community—work connects all of us—and good, union jobs means support for local schools, businesses and opportunities.Together, we leverage the power of our movement to raise standards for all.  And right now the middle has been hollowed-out. Inequality is record high. Wages are stagnant. CEOs are earning 299 times the average worker. People are working two, three jobs when one job should be enough. We are building a modern labor movement that is the counterforce to skyrocketing inequality to transform low-wage, unreliable jobs into good, sustainable union jobs.But with the labor laws broken like they are, today in America, it’s easier for a corporation to stop a union than it is for a worker to form one. That’s why we need the PRO Act, a bill in Congress that will remove barriers like the fear of getting fired when we stand together with our co-workers and try to organize a union. We are building on the foundation of our movement’s history toward a bold, inclusive future—to take on issues like fairness, social and economic justice and income inequality. The voices of people of faith were, are, and will always be critical in the ongoing march for progress. Labor Day calls us to recommit ourselves to working together in partnership.Thank you so much and Happy Labor Day.

92,Redmond: A Union Job Changed Everything,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-union-job-changed-everything,9-5-2021,"AFL-CIO Secretary Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks at the First Institutional Baptist Church:
 Good morning. Thank you, Pastor [Warren] Stewart, for welcoming me to your church. It is great to be here today. Every morning when my feet hit the floor I am grateful. I thank God for this opportunity. To work. To serve. To live a meaningful life.St. Augustine instructed us to pray as though everything depends on God. And to work as though everything depends on us. So today we pray. For peace and prosperity. For every worker, every family and every community. But we also must work. With every ounce of energy God gives us. To build a better society. A society where work pays. And workers are safe. Where health care is a right. And retirement security is a given. A society where unions are strong and free. And racism is rooted out once and for all.Brothers and sisters, a union job can be the difference. I know from experience. I am the son of Curtis and Odessa Redmond. They were the children of sharecroppers. They were born in the Mississippi Delta and made the great migration up to Chicago in 1958. They came with very few belongings but a very strong desire to build a better life. My three brothers and I grew up poor. We lived on food stamps. My mother shopped at Goodwill. While we had little money, my parents were rich in love. In hope. In faith. In an unbreakable work ethic. My father took every kind of job he could find. He pumped gas, was a janitor, and stocked shelves at the supermarket. My mother was a domestic worker. She woke up every day at the crack of dawn and took three buses to the far suburbs of Chicago to clean folks’ houses and cook their food. Every night, after taking three busses back, she would sit at the foot of her bed and soak her feet and read her Bible. No complaints. No excuses. Then something big happened. Something that changed everything. That something was a union job. My dad started working at an aluminum mill outside of Chicago called Reynolds. He had that union job, and so we had more security, opportunity, prosperity. We stopped going to the free clinic. We got off of food stamps. We still went to our local Goodwill—only now it was to donate clothes. More families are waiting for that kind of change. But it’s being held back from them— stolen from too many. Too many Black families. Too many immigrant families. Too many Native American families. Too many young families. All so business can make another buck. They get a dollar. And we lose a dream. It has to stop. Dr. King said that labor and civil rights are the two greatest movements for change. The labor movement built the Black middle class. In auto factories and steel plants. We turned bad jobs into good careers. The civil rights movement protected the right to vote—a right being trampled on here in Arizona as we speak. Dr. King said the labor-hater and the race-baiter is a twin-headed creature, spewing anti-Negro epithets from one mouth and anti-labor propaganda from the other mouth.More than half a century later, that creature is still alive and well. It reared its ugly head on January 6. It is showing its face in Arizona’s sham election audit. And it is given new life every time a corporation tries to stop workers from coming together on the job.But we can overcome. We can rise above. The good people of this nation—all colors, all creeds, young and old—believe in an America of liberty and justice for all. We can pass voting rights and worker empowerment legislation like the PRO Act. We can make sure our elected leaders hear us and listen to us. We can organize for change, just as Dr. King did, while not giving in to fear or hate or division.Labor Day is a celebration of the worker. Workers like my parents and the quiet heroes in each of our families. Workers who are serving America through a pandemic, teaching our children, building our roads and caring for the sick. So let’s give honor to God, the head of our life. And let’s honor the workers who are carrying out His will every single day.Thank you and God bless you.

93,Shuler: Solidarity Is Needed to Combat Climate Change,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-solidarity-needed-combat-climate-change,9-2-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler's remarks as prepared for The Third Vatican Dialogue on Combating Climate Change: Just Transition in Our Common Home.Hello everyone, I’m Liz Shuler, President of the AFL-CIO, representing 56 unions and over 12 million workers and their families in the United States. I am deeply honored to be with all of you at the third Vatican Dialogue on combating climate change. Thank you Cardinal Turkson and the Dicastery, President Jenkins and Dr. Woo of Notre Dame for all you’ve done to make today possible. 
 
In response to Pope Francis’ call to ""care for our common home,"" I want to emphasize one simple, critical point. Scientists tell us we have to take immediate, drastic action to answer climate change. There is only one way to create durable social and political support for that action. It’s through solidarity. Because the only politically viable transition to a low-carbon global economy is a just transition, and the only way to have a just transition is through solidarity.
 
What do I mean by solidarity?
 
First, solidarity means that all workers must have an effective voice in our workplaces and in the political processes where change happens. This requires democratic workers’ organizations. Those organizations belong at the tables where climate policy is made. 
 
In fact, it is only because workers were at those tables that the Paris Agreement itself calls for a just transition and the creation of decent work and the International Labor Organization Just Transition Guidelines make clear the need for social dialogue.
 
Policymakers need to learn from Catholic social teaching on the role of trade unions and apply it to the challenge of fighting climate change for a just transition. Because justice exists in this transition only where workers make it exist through our labor movement—country by country and sector by sector.
 
Second, solidarity means that both the costs and wealth that change will create are shared fairly. The transition to a low-carbon global economy cannot be an excuse to replace good jobs with precarious work and economic security with poverty.
 
And finally, solidarity must be global—embedded in the rules that govern the global trading system. Motivating the multilateral organizations at the center of global climate policy—the UN, the IMF, OECD, and the G20. We have an opportunity—a duty—to heal deep wounds of racism and sexism, the legacies of colonialism and exclusion as we address climate change. As a global community, let’s seize this moment.
 
As a global community, we should draw upon the experiences of working people. Our values should inform our policy making. And solidarity is at the heart of our lived experience.
 
As we are meeting right now, the working people I’m honored to represent are living with and responding to the changing climate—fighting forest fires in California, restoring electric power in Louisiana after Hurricane Ida, cleaning up flood-devastated communities in Tennessee.
 
Worldwide, wherever you see the destructive effects of climate change—in flooded subways of China’s cities, devastated Rhineland valleys or smoldering Turkish orchards—you also see working people putting their lives and health at risk to help others.
 
Working people know from our collective experience that solidarity can drive change. In the early days of the carbon-fuel economy, energy jobs were dangerous and poorly paid. Industry by industry, nation by nation, working people, through our unions, transformed low-wage, dangerous work in the carbon economy to high wage, safer work—and we must do it again in the clean energy economy.
 
But it can only happen if we build it together—all of us—governments, employers, communities and people of faith working together with working people to fill our workplaces with dignity and hope. 
 
Because solidarity is about community. It requires ""place-based strategies,"" creating jobs and opportunities within communities affected by the energy transition and environmental damage before existing jobs are lost. 
 
A coal miner recently told me, ""no one wants to see the planet get ruined, and if I have to pivot into a new industry, then I will, but it can’t just be all on me."" Solidarity means standing as a global community with coal miners and precarious workers in the green economy—it means we help each other.
 
Recently, Pope Francis said his message on climate change was both a social message and an environmental message. So I would like to close by returning to his words: ""where injustices abound and growing numbers of people are deprived of basic human rights and considered expendable, the principle of the common good immediately becomes, logically and inevitably, a summons to solidarity and preferential option for the poorest of our brothers and sisters."" 
 
My friends, acting on Pope Francis’ call to solidarity is not only the best path, it is the only path toward safeguarding our common home. Thank you.

94,Shuler: We Will Meet This Moment With a Modern Labor Movement,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-we-will-meet-moment-modern-labor-movement,8-31-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks at the Christian Science Monitor Labor Day Breakfast:Thank you, Linda [Feldmann], for that kind introduction. This event has become a Labor Day tradition for the AFL-CIO. I know how much you all enjoyed interacting with Rich Trumka. He did the Monitor breakfast 12 times, and enjoyed sparring with you each and every year. We miss him dearly. I am humbled and honored to be the president of the AFL-CIO. We are the largest organization of working women in the country. Other than the U.S. military, we run the largest job training network in America. And we are leading long-overdue structural transformation.I believe in my bones that the labor movement is the single most powerful force for progress. And I’m not talking about institutions. I’m talking about workers coming together to make change in our workplaces and our society. That’s what we do. Through the worst public health crisis in a century, the worst economy since the Great Depression, working people stepped up. We carried communities through the pandemic. We’re responding to Ida. We’re helping evacuation efforts in Afghanistan. We were, are, and always will be essential.This is a moment of tremendous opportunity. From tech to transportation, working people are speaking up and taking risks to create real change. Public approval of unions is at a nearly 50-year high—65 percent and rising, including 71 percent of young people—as more Americans see unions as the solution to our broken economic rules. And because of the labor movement’s efforts, we have the most pro-worker administration in history and a working majority in Congress.We must meet this moment by building a modern labor movement.
 
A movement that is open and accessible and diverse. A movement that keeps pace with a changing economy—the “She-session” and Great Resignation. A movement in every sector and every community, with women and people of color at the center, where every worker has the right to a good, sustainable, union job.
 
All of that depends on putting working people where we belong: at the center of policy and the national conversation.We are the counterforce to skyrocketing inequality. We balance the economy. Working people want to join us—60 million workers would form a union today, according to MIT, including half of the tech workforce.So if 60 million workers want in, why isn’t the labor movement growing? Because the rules are broken. Today in America, it’s easier for a corporation to stop a union than it is for a worker to form one.That’s why we need the Richard Trumka PRO Act and the public sector PRO Act right alongside it.The PRO Act is the centerpiece of our Workers First Agenda. These are the policies we voted for in the 2020 election.We’re putting the full might of our movement into voting rights, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the For the People Act. We’re championing the budget resolution with child care tax credits, and the first ever federal paid family and medical leave benefit.It also includes a long overdue path to citizenship for immigrant workers. And a major provision of the PRO Act: real penalties against employers who interfere with our right to form a union.These would all represent major progress. And progress is what I am focused on as AFL-CIO president.To meet this moment, we’re going to be bold and inclusive. Every working person in every kind of job can have a place in our movement.Our doors are wide open—we invite people to join us as we take on issues like fairness, racial justice and gender equity—all part of a modern labor movement.And we are going to innovate because just focusing on protecting what we have is far more dangerous than taking risks.For example, technology is especially changing how we work. We don’t want it to replace or exploit us. We want technology to complement and support the human beings on the job.That’s why I was proud to work with unions in every sector to launch the AFL-CIO Technology Institute in partnership with MIT, Stanford, and Carnegie Mellon. It’s a center of gravity for co-creating, incubating new ideas and innovating growth. I also had the privilege to launch Next Up, a program focused on bringing more young workers into our movement, a goal that will guide my presidency every single day. A modern labor movement can build an America where every working person has access to the life-changing power of a good, sustainable, union job.No exceptions. No one left behind. That’s my number one priority. That’s my vision. That’s my promise to America’s workers.  And with that, I’ll take your questions.

95,Shuler: Democracy Puts Power Behind Our Voices ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-democracy-puts-power-behind-our-voices,8-28-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks at the ""March On for Voting Rights"":I’m Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO. We are the House of Labor, 56 unions with 12.5 million people working in all kinds of jobs across our economy. Thank you Fred Yamashita for building up the House of Labor here in Arizona. If you don’t know what a union is, it’s the official way to stand together with your co-workers to have more power to improve your workplace.What does that have to do with democracy and voting rights?To explain, I want to tell you a story from Congressman John Lewis, the great civil rights leader who was part of the historic March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 58 years ago today. Congressman Lewis used to talk about weathering a storm in his tin-roof house in Troy, Alabama. He was with family and through this storm it felt like the house would uproot and blow away. But wherever the house lifted from its foundation, one corner, another corner, everyone in the house would stand together running from side to side to hold it down. And John Lewis said the wind may blow, the thunder may roll, the lightning may flash but never, ever, leave the house. He said we live in the same house. Black, white, all ages, faiths, genders. We are one people, one family, one house. Well, in our house, the House of Labor, voting rights and workers rights are one. Every worker in every job can find a place they belong. And together, we are standing against the storm that is trying to uproot our rights, our freedoms, our very democracy. We’re facing a fundamental assault by extremist lawmakers on our voting rights at the ballot box. And at the same time, corporations are using everything they can think of to deny our rights to vote in our workplaces to stand together in unions. It’s not a coincidence. Where there are attacks on unions, there are attacks on voting rights. Because unions are democracy in the workplace, and voting rights are democracy at the ballot box, and both put power behind our voices. Like Congressman John Lewis said, in a democracy, the vote is the most powerful non-violent tool we have...and we must use it. And in 2020, we did. We elected the most pro-worker president and vice president in history. We elected a pro-worker majority in the U.S. House, and thanks to efforts like UNITE HERE Local 11 and CASE Action knocking on a million doors in Arizona and then helping get out the vote in Georgia, in the U.S. Senate. Now we’re leveraging our power to build back better. Keyword: better.The House just passed the John Lewis Voting Rights Act plus major investments in working families. Including a path to citizenship and a solid foundation for care infrastructure with credits for child care and the first ever federal benefit for paid family and medical leave. Care is critical infrastructure just like roads and bridges, we depend on care to go to work. And care jobs should be good, union jobs with decent wages because one job should be enough. But Arizona legislators are trying to take all of that progress away from us. They’re undermining the democratic process with a sham audit. They’re trying to overturn our votes while costing taxpayers millions of dollars. And in Washington, a handful of anti-worker senators are using the filibuster to prevent the change we voted for. They’re using it to stop progress for voting rights with the For the People Act and worker empowerment with the Richard Trumka PRO Act. So there’s a clear choice: we’re not going to sideline the hopes, aspirations and representation of the American people. Instead, it’s time to sideline the filibuster. This is about our voices. Attacks on voting and worker rights are targeted to silence and disenfranchise people of color. We will not let racist attacks deny us our rights, freedom or power. We’re raising our voices today and every day moving forward to protect our voting rights, to defend democracy in the workplace and democracy at the ballot box. We’re calling on both of Arizona’s senators, who we helped elect, to do the right thing. Sideline the filibuster. Pass the For the People Act, the Richard Trumka PRO Act. That’s how through this storm we will protect our House and what it stands for: Workers’ rights. Voting Rights. Economic equality. Racial justice. We will continue the ongoing march for jobs and justice that those who came before us, like John Lewis, took so very far. Every working person has the right to a good, union job. And every American has the right to vote! Thank you Arizona!

96,Shuler: Trade Must Lift Up Working People,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-trade-must-lift-working-people,8-25-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations Labor Roundtable with U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai:Hello, everyone. Welcome, fellow trade union leaders. Thank you, Shoya Yoshida, I’m honored to co-host this discussion with you and the ITUC. Thank you to our esteemed guest and steadfast champion for working people, United States Trade Representative Ambassador Katherine Tai.This discussion, ahead of her meeting with counterparts at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), is important. But, first, we are all still grieving Richard Trumka’s unexpected passing on August 5th. Thank you for the outpouring of support, for sharing memories and tributes. We received messages all over the world, from the global trade union movement. We will be planning a public memorial service in the coming months, and because of the pandemic, we also never had the chance to honor the late John Sweeney. So we are in consultation with both of their families to honor them in the most thoughtful way. You cannot talk about Rich Trumka’s legacy without talking about trade. He was relentless in pursuit of a fairer model. And there was no one on this continent more central to the USMCA than Rich. He always said global trade policy was at the heart of building an economy that works for all. And now, we have a template for global trade that puts workers first. So every deal we negotiate from here forward will be on a foundation that Rich helped build. Please join me now in a moment of silence for Rich Trumka. [A moment of silence is observed.] Thank you. As the newly-elected president of the AFL-CIO, I want to say that I believe the global labor movement is the single most powerful force in the world for progress, toward a fairer economic model that prioritizes gender equity, racial justice, the environment and working people. This is a moment for us to lead, to leverage our power, build an equitable future and put workers’ rights at the center of our global economy, policies and trade because everyone deserves to have a decent, sustainable job. And as part of that vision, global trade union leaders belong at every table where policy is made. Our voices belong in every step of the decision-making process. That’s how we create worker-centered trade policies. For decades, we’ve been excluded—or included only as an afterthought. Trade deals have prioritized the interests of global capital and large corporations. And as a result it has devastated working families, the environment and social stability worldwide. But with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the U.S. has begun the shift to a trade model with workers at the center. Less than a year after it went into effect, with Ambassador Tai’s leadership, the U.S. is already using the USMCA’s labor enforcement tools. In May, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative directed Mexico to investigate if workers at a GM facility in Silao were denied their rights during a contract ratification. This was the first time the U.S. government used the new rapid response tool and it was the first time in history that the U.S. proactively initiated labor enforcement in a trade agreement.And just last week we got results—those GM workers voted to reject the exploitative company-friendly contract, a major step forward for North American auto workers. The USMCA also contains strong labor and environmental commitments that are enforceable against both governments and corporations. And USMCA requires all three countries to implement an effective ban on importing goods made with forced labor. We want to scale similar models and progress everywhere in the world. That’s why we’re working with Sharan [Burrow] and the ITUC to bring enforceable labor standards into the World Trade Organization. No more race to the bottom—we want to create a social floor, a new foundation for the global economy that lifts up all working people. That’s the point of our discussion today: ASEAN’s approach to trade policy is outdated, it’s stuck in the 1990s.  ASEAN has never had a formal mechanism to include voices and perspectives from trade unions in its member states. It has a mechanism to hear from 15 separate business organizations but zero from organized labor. We belong at the table. Without us ASEAN’s latest trade deal, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), has no commitments to internationally recognized labor rights and environmental standards. At this critical moment to move forward on trade policy RCEP is driving in the wrong direction, in the race to the bottom. And by doubling down on the failed neoliberal trade model, it’s fueling economic inequality.There is a lot of work ahead of us to help APEC reverse course and into alignment with our vision of a “worker-centered” trade policy. But I know what the leaders on this call are capable of and together, we will rise to meet this moment. Ambassador Tai recently spoke directly to working people. She said, “really listening and working with workers, the labor movement and a broad range of stakeholders—leads to more pro-worker, more meaningful and more popular policy.”That is worker-centered leadership in action. It’s the vision we need and it’s how we’re going to drive progress toward worker-centered trade policy, together. I’ll stop here so we can hear from Shoya Yoshida and then Ambassador Katherine Tai.

I was hoping to be there in person with you all—I know Stuart Appelbaum is there with you—but unfortunately I’m on Zoom instead.Even remotely, it’s good to be with you. And just let me say thank you all for keeping our national AFL-CIO in your thoughts. And for all the supportive messages and love you’ve shared.We are all still grieving the loss of Rich Trumka. I take comfort in the fact his final days were spent with the people he loved the most, fishing and enjoying the outdoors, in his beloved home state of Pennsylvania. We will be planning a public memorial service in the coming months and because of the pandemic, we also never had the chance to honor the late John Sweeney so we are in consultation with both of their families to honor them in the most thoughtful and safe way.You know that Rich was absolutely laser focused on the PRO Act because he wanted every working person, on every job, to have the power and support of a union. So it’s a fitting tribute that our friends in Congress are going to rename it the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act.  Iowa labor, we’re going to build on the amazing work you did over the last few months when you engaged state legislators and showed up at Senator Ernst’s offices and Senator Grassley’s offices in the Quad Cities, in Western Iowa, and in Des Moines. We’re going to keep going, we are going to pass it and Rich’s memory will be there with every step forward. Please, join me now in a moment of silence for Rich.[A moment of silence is observed.]Thank you.I don’t need to tell you, the entire country focuses on Iowa every four years. And our entire movement sees and feels the work Iowa labor does, day in and day out. You called out Iowa OSHA by filing with the federal “Complaints About State Program Administration” because Iowa OSHA wasn’t following its own procedures or conducting inspections, making it difficult for workers to file complaints. Despite the barriers you filed an OSHA complaint against the state legislature for not protecting workers, not enforcing social distancing, not requiring employees to report positive results and not keeping proper records of workplace injuries.During the 2021 legislative session you stopped big unemployment cuts. And you’re up against a trifecta within the state that’s growing more partisan and anti-worker, and less democratic. But by showing up, raising our voices, making our presence visible and loud, you are strengthening our movement. And we are such a powerful and uniting force for good, all across this country.Look at what you're doing in Council Bluffs where you collected back-to-school donations and the IAFF hosted a blood drive with the Red Cross at their hall. There’s the Dubuque Area Labor Harvest, meeting an increased demand to provide food assistance, distributing boxes to families and making deliveries to folks who can't leave home. Just last Saturday their breakfast served 199 people. That sense of belonging and support of a broader movement of working people who are all pulling in the same direction makes a difference in Iowa, but it’s important to our entire labor family of 56 unions, 12.5 million working people in all sectors of our economy. And the progress we make, together, as one united movement lifts up every working person in this country.We’re building on our proud traditions and the hard-won progress made by local legends and leaders like my IBEW brother Ken Sagar, Randy Boulton, USW, and Anthony Stephens UPWA. They’ve earned their places in the Labor Hall of Fame. And to the next generation of labor leaders—Charlie, Pete—we are so grateful for your dedication and taking on this responsibility. Thank you for your leadership, we want to invest in you, in our future. Because this is an inflection point.

And as testament to the resilience of our movement, last Friday the Executive Council elected the most diverse leadership team in history. I want to emphasize the word team: Fred Redmond, Tefere [Gebre], me, and all of you. And your theme of this convention is exactly right: Organize. The time is now. We have the most pro-worker administration in history, a majority in the U.S. House and Senate. Workers all across the country are standing up, taking risks in the workplace and protesting in the streets. And the public is on our side. They see the progress we’ve made on pension security for millions of retirees. Health care. Child tax credits that are ending food insecurity for millions of children. The labor movement’s power was behind that progress. And just yesterday the House passed the $3.5 trillion budget resolution and advanced the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. Just take a moment and think about that. We are one step closer to the biggest investment in almost 100 years: in infrastructure, manufacturing, supply chains and job training. Roads, bridges and waterways. Public transportation, rural broadband. Clean energy research and climate resilience. A solid foundation for care infrastructure with the first ever federal paid family and medical leave benefit. There's a long overdue path to citizenship. Real penalties to hold employers who violate workers rights accountable and a huge funding increase for labor law enforcement. This is our opportunity to create good, sustainable union jobs, revive manufacturing, grow new industries and build back better in towns and local economies all over Iowa. Keyword, better. Better than it is, better than it was. Because you know too well, in the past, bad policy enabled corporations to offshore, manufacturing shut down and left workers in Iowa and so many communities stranded. With deindustrialization and the shift in power from workers to the wealthy there was a loss of union density. In Iowa, we went from 20% in 1990 to about 9% today. And with that decrease in union density, inequality is skyrocketing. How do we reverse it? By growing our ranks. American-made industries with American supply-chains with good, sustainable union jobs. Those are key to the 21st Century vision for America’s future. Especially as we build climate change resilience and grow the clean energy future. Iowa is the second leading state for wind power—I think Texas has one up on you for now. And we don’t want to just generate wind power, we should be manufacturing those wind turbines and all of their components right here in the U.S., in Iowa. Another part of this is our trade policy, and how we use it to leverage worker power. You remember the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), that’s the game-changing trade model we want to use going forward because it puts workers at the center.  It has powerful labor enforcement tools and with Ambassador Katherine Tai’s leadership as the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. is already using it. In May, the Office of the USTR directed Mexico to investigate if workers at a GM facility were denied their rights during a contract ratification. You probably know that Mexico is famous for their Company unions and protection contracts. This was the first time in history that the U.S. proactively initiated labor enforcement in a trade agreement.  Just last week—we got results—those GM workers voted to reject the sham contract. This is a major step forward for North American auto workers. No more race to the bottom. And a concrete example of how to use our trade policy to benefit workers! We know enforcing labor rights in Mexico is important to workers in Iowa. Because we shouldn’t have to compete with people making three dollars an hour and workers in Mexico shouldn’t be exploited with low wages by these corporations. I’m also looking at other ways we can leverage worker power like with the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. This is a huge federal investment in science and technology research, where we can shore up American supply chains and seed future American industries and manufacturing. We want to make sure those investments translate to good jobs, especially in the supply chain so that manufacturing can grow again as we innovate.And we have to include worker voices in the research and development process, in deciding how technology is developed, which leads to better decisions about how the technology is used, and of course the jobs that flow from new technology. We don’t want technology to replace manufacturing jobs. We want technology to complement and support the human beings in manufacturing.I think of this as collective creation; we can co-create with technology. Here’s the bottom line: as we make major national investments in infrastructure, supply chains, manufacturing, science and technology research, they need to work for U.S. To do that, we need the Richard Trumka PRO Act and the public sector PRO Act right alongside it. To make sure jobs now, and on the horizon in those new industries, will be good, union jobs. To make sure the clean energy future, American manufacturing and supply chains are union-made. And to lift up worker voice and ideas so that we benefit from our taxpayer investments. Because this isn’t just about unions. It’s about the fundamental economic power of working people in the United States. And the work you’re doing in Iowa is changing lives. You’re standing up in workplaces and you’re lifting up each other and the communities where we work.Teachers are caravaning in the streets demanding safe schools. Meat packing workers rallying outside plants to show how critical we are. Postal workers delivering our democracy in record mail-in-ballots. Health care workers demanding PPE. State workers taking on the Capitol to demand safety on the job. Iowa labor, you are inspiring working people to take action, you're showing the country that strong unions mean strong communities, and more unions mean safer workplaces and better opportunities. We want those good, sustainable union jobs for everyone. For the first time in years, in 2020, union density in Iowa rose because six-thousand working people in Iowa joined unions. We want to keep that growth trajectory up. Organize, organize, organize. Keep up the great work. The time is now. Thank you Iowa labor.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
98,Shuler: Nevada Labor Keeps Stepping Up,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-nevada-labor-keeps-stepping,8-23-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks to the Nevada AFL-CIO Convention:Hello, Nevada. I am honored to be with you—even though it’s by video—and how exciting to be following Governor [Steve] Sisolak’s powerful message to open the convention. We are in awe of his leadership and your partnership, passing the largest expansion of collective bargaining rights for state workers anywhere in the U.S. in 16 years. What an accomplishment. I wanted to thank you all for keeping our national AFL-CIO in your thoughts and for sending us strength. We are working through a heartbreaking loss in unprecedented times full of so many challenges. As you know our president Rich Trumka passed away unexpectedly on August 5th. I take comfort in the fact his final days were spent with the people he loved the most—fishing and enjoying the outdoors, in his beloved home state of Pennsylvania. Rich was looking forward to this convention, to thanking and acknowledging all of you, our elected labor allies and celebrating Nevada labor. He wanted to wish Rusty [McAllister] a wonderful retirement and I want to wish you all the best in your next chapter as well, Rusty. You’ve done what every leader strives for, which is to leave the organization in a better place than when you found it. We are grateful. As we look forward, the best way we can honor Rich’s life is by continuing his life’s work. You know that Rich was absolutely laser-focused on the PRO Act. That’s why it’s so fitting that our friends in Congress are going to rename the PRO Act in Rich’s honor. So we are going to carry his legacy with us. We are going to press forward and with the leadership of Senator Catherine Cortez-Masto and Senator Jacky Rosen, we are going to pass the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act. We’re going to keep moving with our labor champions in the House—Congressman Steven Horsford, Congresswoman Dina Titus and Congresswoman Susie Lee.And Rich’s memory will be there with every step forward.  Please, join me now in a moment of silence for Rich and all he’s done for our movement.[Ten second pause.]Thank you.Through the worst public health crisis in a century, through the worst economy since the Great Depression and the hottest summer on record, Nevada labor keeps stepping up.Because of you, with our pro-labor elected officials in the Nevada Assembly, working families have won game-changing, statewide legislation. We won right to return for hospitality workers. We won tools to empower care workers. We won expanded protections for construction workers by ending contractor misclassification. That bill was introduced by Assemblywoman Maggie Carlton, a member of UNITE HERE’s Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which has been fighting for fair wages, job security and good health benefits for working men and women in Nevada for 83 years. That’s what solidarity and momentum looks like on the state level. And because you organized and mobilized brilliantly to elect the most pro-worker administration—a majority in the U.S. House and Senate—we’re seeing urgency on the federal level. The bipartisan infrastructure deal and the budget resolution that passed the Senate are investments in us: American-made with union labor. Roads, bridges and waterways. Public transportation, rural broadband, job training. Clean energy research and climate resilience. The first ever federal paid family and medical leave benefit because just like roads and bridges, care is critical infrastructure people need to be able to go to work. There's a long overdue path to citizenship. Real penalties to hold employers who violate workers' rights accountable and a huge funding increase for labor law enforcement. In every conversation I have I like to point out that those infrastructure jobs are absolutely jobs for women. As Vice President Harris put it, “Hard hats are unisex.” And that is so important because COVID-19 has touched every community but women lost almost a million more jobs than men, with Black and Latina women suffering the greatest job losses. We want investments in apprenticeship programs that are going to create not just a JOB, but a family- supporting CAREER. And the labor movement is the gold standard. We are the bridge to high-growth, high-demand jobs. Our apprenticeship readiness and apprenticeship programs put people on the path to the middle class. And we are laser-focused on recruiting women and people of color. We’re going to count on the new leadership of the Nevada AFL-CIO to continue to create an inclusive environment, build equitable representation, foster new labor leaders at work and within our federated bodies. This is a moment to think and act from a spirit of innovation and grow. We have a once-in-a-generation chance to get it right. Everyone's included. No community left behind. American-made industries, American supply-chains. High labor standards on every tax dollar invested in construction with PLAs and Davis-Bacon protections; worker perspective and voice in every step of the innovation process as new technology is evolving and shaping our work; and we need the Richard L. Trumka PRO Act and a national public sector PRO Act right alongside it to make sure jobs now and jobs on the horizon in new industries will be good, union jobs. We need the PRO Act to remove barriers like the fear of getting fired when we stand together with our co-workers and try to organize a union. We need the PRO Act to make sure the clean energy future and American innovation are union-made. And to lift up worker voice and perspective so that we benefit from our taxpayer investments. Because this isn’t just about unions. It’s about fairness, it’s about the fundamental economic power of working people in the United States.I know you. I know our federation. And I am so hopeful for the future. The labor movement is the single most powerful force for progress in this country. We’re going to lead societal transformations, leverage our power to bring women and people of color from the margins to the center—at work, in our unions and in our economy. And we are going to be that center of gravity for incubating new ideas that will unleash unprecedented union growth. Thank you and have a great convention!

99,Shuler: Voting Rights and Labor Rights Are One,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-voting-rights-and-labor-rights-are-one,8-21-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks at a ""Fighting for Our Vote"" rally:Thank you to the NAACP and ACLU. I’m honored to stand with voting rights champions here and all across our country...including...AFSCME President Lee Saunders…here with us…AFT President Randi Weingarten who is kicking it off in Cleveland...and NEA President Becky Pringle who is firing up Detroit. And thanks to Dyana Forester for her leadership of the Metro Washington Council.On behalf of the AFL-CIO’s 12.5 million members...who fight for the rights of all working people. We are standing up...for voting rights...against racial discrimination and voter suppression. That means protecting the right to vote...expanding the right to vote…and making it easier to exercise the right to vote.We need guaranteed early voting. We need mail-in voting and ballot drop boxes...in every community...in every state.We need safety measures and enforcement for voters and poll workers. And to protect our voting rights...we need to pass laws including the For the People Act...and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. I can still hear John Lewis telling that story about weathering a storm in his tin-roof house in Troy, Alabama. If you ever heard the Congressman speak you know it. He was with family...and through this storm...it felt like the house would uproot and blow away. But wherever the house lifted from its foundation...one corner, another corner...everyone in the house would stand together...running from side to side to hold it down. And John Lewis said, the wind may blow. The thunder may roll. The lightning may flash. But never...ever...leave the house. He said, we live in the same house. Black, white, all ages, faiths, genders. We are one people, one family, one house. Well, in our house...the House of Labor...voting rights and labor rights are one. Economic justice and racial justice go hand in hand. Together, we will continue standing against the storm that is trying to uproot our voting rights. We’re facing a FUNDAMENTAL ASSAULT by extremist lawmakers on our voting rights at the ballot box. And at the same time, corporations are using every union-busting tactic they can think of to deny workers’ rights to vote in their workplace to join a union. It’s not a coincidence. Where there are attacks on unions, there are attacks on voting rights. Because unions and voting rights put power behind our voices. And those attacks are targeted especially to hurt and disenfranchise people of color. But we won’t let racist efforts deny us our rights...freedom...or power. Like Congressman John Lewis said, the vote is the most powerful non-violent tool we have in a democracy...and we must use it.And in 2020, we did...we voted in record numbers. We elected the most pro-worker president and vice president in history. A pro-worker majority in the U.S. House and...thanks to organizers in Georgia...in the U.S. Senate.  But a handful of anti-worker senators are using the filibuster to prevent the change we voted for. They’re using it to stop progress for voting rights...and worker empowerment. So there’s a clear choice...we’re not going to sideline the hopes, aspirations and representation of the American people. Instead, it’s time to sideline the filibuster...pass voter protection...pass the Richard Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act.This is about our voices. So we’re raising ours...today...and every day moving forward...to protect our voting rights...to defend democracy in the workplace and democracy at the ballot box.And in 2022...we’re going to make sure we are heard...loud and clear.Thank you all!   © 2023 AFL-CIO.

100,Redmond: I Want to Give Back to Every Worker,https://aflcio.org/speeches/redmond-i-want-give-back-every-worker,8-20-2021,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond delivered the following remarks after his election:Thank you, Liz (Shuler). Thank you, Tefere (Gebre). Thank you, all. President (Lee) Saunders, I am humbled by your words. I am grateful for your friendship. I am committed to your cause. President (Tom) Conway...Brother Tom...thank you for everything. I will always be a proud Steelworker. Some of you know me well. Some of you know me through this Executive Council. And some of you don’t know me yet. I look forward to meeting with all of you. I look forward to working with all of you. And I could not be more proud to serve with the first woman president in the history of the AFL-CIO. I am the son of Curtis and Odessa Redmond. They were the children of sharecroppers. They were born in the Mississippi Delta and made the great migration up to Chicago in 1958. They came with very little belongings but a very strong desire to build a better life.My three brothers and I grew up poor. We lived on food stamps. We shopped at Goodwill. But what we lacked in money my parents gave us in love. In hope. In faith. In an unbreakable work ethic. My father took every kind of job he could find. He pumped gas, was a janitor, and stocked shelves at the supermarket. My mother was a domestic worker. She woke up every day at the crack of dawn and took three buses to the far suburbs of Chicago to clean folks’ houses and cook their food. Every night she would sit at the foot of her bed and soak her feet and read her Bible.No complaints. No excuses. I am standing on their shoulders today. When my dad got a union job at an aluminum mill outside of Chicago called Reynolds, it changed everything. We had more security...opportunity...prosperity. We stopped going to the free clinic. We got off of food stamps. And my mother no longer bought our school clothes from the Goodwill. This is personal to me. I want every worker to have that chance. I want every family to feel that joy. That’s my goal as your secretary-treasurer. And I promise you: no one will work harder. Work ethic is in my DNA. It’s how I honor my parents and this labor movement and every union member. We have a huge opportunity in front of us. And we’re going to take it. I promise you that. Liz (Shuler) and I are not the perfect officers. But together with Tefere (Gebre), we can form the perfect team for this moment. To organize. To mobilize. To win racial justice, secure voting rights and pass the PRO Act. To do that, we need to spend our resources wisely. Be strategic. Get return on our investment. And take smart risks. I am committed to continuing Liz’s (Shuler) financial transparency and accountability as secretary-treasurer. I know she will help guide me as I take on this new challenge. Brothers and sisters, the labor movement is my life. It’s my love. It’s who I am. You won’t find a degree on my wall. I followed my father into the factory. And it’s the best decision I’ve ever made. The fruits of my labor are bountiful. It’s the gift that keeps on giving. And I want to give back...to every worker...to every family...to every community. The author Isabel Wilkerson writes that the price of privilege is the moral duty to act when one sees another person treated unfairly.So in this House of Labor...on this historic day...let’s act. For each other. For our movement. For our nation.Thank you.  © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Redmond
101,Shuler: This Could Be the Most Unifying Moment in Labor History,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-could-be-most-unifying-moment-labor-history,8-20-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks after her election:I recognize both the honor and the responsibility I now have as president. We never thought we’d be here, through a pandemic, so many tragedies...and the sudden loss of Rich. We didn’t want this milestone to happen this way. But through your resilience and dedication to our movement...you’ve just elected the most diverse leadership team in our history. Keyword...team...Fred (Redmond), Tefere (Gebre), me...and all of you. This is just the very beginning of a longer, ongoing discussion about change and the future. We’re going to build a modern labor movement to meet this extraordinary moment. People are hurting and scared...there aren’t enough good, sustainable jobs...the middle class has been hollowed out...COVID-19 has amplified long-standing structural inequity... our systems are broken...the climate crisis is accelerating...technology is changing how work is done...but we want working people to know they can find hope with us. I believe in my bones...that the labor movement is the single most powerful force for progress and that this is a moment for us to lead societal transformations; to leverage our power to bring women and people of color from the margins to the center...at work, in our unions and in our economy; and to be the center of gravity for incubating new ideas that will unleash unprecedented union growth. We have everything lined up… with a pro-worker administration and Congress...the public is on our side...and workers all across the country are standing up and taking risks. This is our chance...we will meet this moment as one united federation. In the coming months, we will hone our strategy, sharpen our focus and deepen our capacity. One thing I’d like to make crystal clear: Affiliate engagement will guide my presidency. It isn’t an afterthought. I will seek your guidance and input from the beginning...and at every step...in decision making, building strategy and how we execute.We have a lot of opportunities...but we don’t want to be too diffuse, that dilutes our effectiveness...instead, we need to unite around a set of priorities, go after them and be disciplined in our approach. Let’s identify and scale what works. And let’s be honest about what doesn’t. I’m excited to have those conversations with you. Because we are at an inflection point...we’re building a bridge...between our incredible history, our time-honored traditions...and a bold, cutting-edge future.I want every working person in every kind of job...to see they can have a place in our movement. We’re not a bunch of smoke filled back rooms. We’re open. We’re transparent. We welcome Gen Z and millennials in the streets and in the halls of power...organizing at the grassroots...AND working to advance policy in D.C and state houses across the country.It’s not an either-or scenario. We can...and will...walk AND chew gum at the same time. I’ve been proud to stand with you as we’ve won national elections and made progress on our Workers First Agenda. Pension relief. Health care. And we will keep pushing for infrastructure, voting rights and labor law reform. Everything we do will be in service to organizing and union growth. And on that front...you've heard me talk about Action Builder, a digital organizing tool...built in house from the ground-up. We didn’t just buy it off a shelf and say here, use this. We built it with affiliate unions. And it’s democratizing organizing...making it more accessible for people historically left-out on the sidelines.My point is this: affiliate priorities are federation priorities. And together we are going to be that center of gravity for incubating new ideas. I’d like this council to think of itself as an Innovation Committee—and I ask you to bring your experience, diverse perspectives and ideas to this table...to try new things to catalyze breakthrough union growth— and not be worried about whether we fail. It’s okay to make mistakes—mistakes mean we’re getting out there and doing something different. Because labor can bring America together...our movement is where so many walks of life and issues converge.There’s no doubt about our direction, we’re moving forward, to a future defined by and for working people. The path we’re paving is wide and accessible—everyone included, no one left behindOur power to get there depends on moving as one...on our unity. And this could be the most unifying moment in labor history. That’s up to every person here around our table. And I am so thrilled Fred (Redmond), to have you on this team. You've earned the respect of this entire movement, taking on tough challenges, from racial justice to organizing, building consensus every step of the way. Thank you for taking on this new role; you will be a great secretary-treasurer and a tremendous partner for Tefere (Gebre) and me as we lead the AFL-CIO forward. Thank you again to this Executive Council for the honor of serving as your 6th president…I stand on the shoulders of those who came before me, and look forward to building the future together. Let's get to work!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
102,Shuler Salutes 125 Years of Ironworkers' Breakthroughs,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-salutes-125-years-ironworkers-breakthroughs,8-10-2021,"AFL-CIO Acting President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks to the Ironworkers Convention: Thank you so much for the kind introduction, Eric [Dean]. And thank you to everyone for all the notes, calls, texts and expressions of love and support these last few days. As I know you’ve heard, Rich passed away last week. He was camping with his family in Pennsylvania, fishing and being outdoors with his grandkids, doing what he loved. Rich was looking forward to this convention, to thanking and acknowledging all of you and celebrating 125 years of Ironworker solidarity. And while we recognize that proud history and its traditions, Rich really respected Eric for his innovative leadership, and how he is always looking forward. As we look forward now. I see the best way we can honor Rich’s life is by continuing his life’s work. We will carry Rich’s spirit with us as we press forward to pass the  Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act. That’s right, our friends in Congress are renaming the PRO Act after our beloved leader. And Rich’s spirit will be with us as we pass these historic infrastructure investments (today in the Senate) that will boost the economy and create good union jobs. Rich’s legacy will live in the actions we take to pass new legislation to protect every American’s right to vote. In that way, his legend will always live on. Please, join me now in a moment of silence in his honor. [Ten second pause.]Thank you.In your 125 year history, Ironworkers have met so many challenges and made just as many breakthroughs. One-hundred years ago a different viral pandemic killed hundreds of thousands of prime-age workers. Twenty years ago New York Ironworkers answered the call in the aftermath of 9/11, those who ran back into the rubble at Ground Zero and so many throughout the tri-state area and from all across the country were involved in the cleanup. Five years ago, Ironworkers made history as the first building trade to establish paid maternity leave, setting the standard and example for other trades to follow. And less than one year ago we elected the most pro-worker administration—thanks to your early and consistent support of President Biden and Vice President Harris.And with a pro worker majority in the House and Senate...now we’re going to build back better—keyword better—better than it is or ever was, with unions. We’re on the brink of historic investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, supply chains and job training. Roads, bridges. Waterways. Public transportation, rural development, public education. And investments that recognize care is critical infrastructure. The $3.5 trillion budget resolution being voted on this week would create the first ever federal Paid Family and Medical Leave benefit. It includes clean energy research and game-changing infrastructure. There's a long overdue path to citizenship. And labor law enforcement, with real penalties. In every conversation I have I like to point out that those infrastructure jobs are absolutely jobs for women. As Vice President Harris put it, “Hard hats are unisex.” And that is so important because COVID-19 has touched every community but women lost almost a million more jobs than men, with Black and Latina women suffering the greatest job losses. To help those women and everyone who’s been sidelined, we want investments in apprenticeship programs that are going to create not just a job, but a family-supporting career. And the labor movement is the gold standard. We are the bridge to high-growth, high-demand jobs. Our apprenticeship readiness and apprenticeship programs put people on the path to the middle class. And your work to open the doors wider than ever in your recruitment process is exactly what we need. I know Vicki O'Leary has done some amazing work to launch The Lean In Circles community to help women succeed in the trades. It’s effective because it enables women to come together (even virtually via Zoom) to share strategies, improve their experiences at work and give them the tools to thrive on the job. That’s the type of innovation mindset we need. Because this is our moment to grow. We have a once-in-a-generation chance to get it right. Everyone included. No community left behind. American-made industries, American supply-chains. High labor standards on every tax dollar invested in construction with PLAs and Davis-Bacon protections; worker perspective and voice in every step of the innovation process as new technology is evolving and shaping our work.And we need the Richard Trumka PRO Act to make sure jobs now and jobs on the horizon in new industries will be good, union jobs. We need the PRO Act to remove barriers like the fear of getting fired when we stand together with our co-workers and try to organize a union. We need the PRO Act to make sure the clean energy future and American innovation are union-made. And to lift up worker voice and perspective so that we benefit from our taxpayer investments. Because this isn’t just about unions. It’s about the fundamental economic power of working people in the United States. It’s about the next generation of Ironworkers and how they’ll innovate and organize. And how, together, 12.5 million working people in 56 unions we are the most powerful vehicle for progress in this country.Thank you and congratulations on this amazing milestone.

103,Shuler Outlines Opportunities for Growth and Innovation at IFPTE Convention,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-outlines-opportunities-growth-and-innovation-ifpte-convention,8-10-2021,"AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks to the IFPTE convention:Thank you so much, Matt [Biggs]—and for your leadership over these many years. And thank you to everyone watching out there for all the notes, calls, texts and expressions of love and support.As you’ve heard, Rich [Trumka] passed away last week in Pennsylvania where he was camping with his family—fishing and being outdoors with his grandkids—.doing what he loved. Rich was looking forward to this convention—to thanking and acknowledging Paul [Shearon] for everything he’s done for our movement. He wanted to wish Paul a wonderful retirement...and I want to wish you all the best in your next chapter as well, Paul.All of you know how Paul led the landmark Boeing strike in 2000 at his home local, SPEEA—back when it was an open shop. Rich had that in common with you Paul, bringing his Pittston strike experience from his Mineworker days. And of course Rich was there on the ground during your strike to fire-up the picket line. He led the negotiated settlement with you...and he made sure, going forward...it was a closed shop. The life-changing gains that continue to impact IFPTE families...are part of Rich’s living legacy. Rich’s memory will be there with every step forward we take for unions, organizing rights, civil rights, dignity, worker power...and the strength of our democracy. In that way, he’ll never really be gone. Please join me now in a moment of silence in his honor. [Ten second pause.]Thank you. I worked side by side with Rich Trumka at the AFL-CIO for 12 years. We talked often about what a moment it is right now in the labor movement. I am so hopeful for our future. We are already creating opportunities for growth and innovation. Have you ever seen that bumper sticker or meme? The Labor Movement: the folks who brought you the weekend. I love it because that’s a perfect example of union innovation that impacts everyone. That’s part of our history. Think back and picture the days of grim and dangerous factories and mills, when there was no concept of having a life away from work. That was inhumane and unsustainable. And to our movement, unacceptable. So we got creative. We invented the weekend. There’s a parallel to today—changes have accelerated in the pandemic. And we’ve seen what happens as union density has decreased—income inequality has skyrocketed. To reverse that trend, to shrink inequality, we have to grow union density. We have to organize into action, reach new workplaces. We have to innovate. And I know because of our solidarity, your strength and your character, we’re going to define and win what’s the next weekend. Because the labor movement is the most powerful vehicle for progress in this country. We elected pro-worker majorities in the House and Senate, the most pro-worker administration, and look what we won for working families in the American rescue plan. To protect jobs and strengthen supply chains, IFPTE and SPEEA with the Machinists Union championed the bipartisan Aviation Manufacturing Jobs Protection Act. Your advocacy secured $350 billion for state and local governments, $170 billion for public education, $30.5 billion for public transit and $75 billion for housing and community development. That means job security, vital services and healthy communities. IFPTE sounded the alarm on nonprofit employers, including anti-union think tanks, qualifying for the Paycheck Protection Program while unions were excluded. The results: PPP was extended to unions in the American Rescue Plan. And the child tax credits we won are cutting child poverty in half. And throughout so many challenges IFPTE members have been on the frontlines serving so much more than themselves. We know IFPTE members were essential before and during the pandemic and you’re essential to building back better after. Keyword better—better than it is, better than it’s ever been. And here’s why we need to keep the pressure on: We’re on the brink of a generational investment in working families.The $3.5 trillion budget resolution, as currently written would create the first ever federal Paid Family and Medical Leave benefit—investment that recognizes care is critical infrastructure. It includes clean energy research and game-changing infrastructure. There's a long overdue path to citizenship. Real penalties for employers who violate workers rights. And a huge funding increase for labor law enforcement, which will empower working people.  This goes with the bipartisan infrastructure plan we’ve been hearing about for months, that would bring investments in roads, bridges and waterways. Public transportation, rural broadband and job training. Not to mention the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, investment in science and technology research to shore up American supply chains and seed future American industries. We see untapped potential. The U.S. is a world leader in science and technology innovation.But we haven’t been great at translating those publicly funded investments into good American job gains. At least not in recent years. The example that I always think about, for how we want it to work, is the U.S. space program that first put an American on the moon. It was funded entirely by our tax dollars. It gave us new technologies, created new business. It supported families and local communities. It was built and maintained and run by union labor, including IFPTE members. But bad policy enabled offshoring. With deindustrialization there was a shift in power. We began to lose union density and all that unions provide, not just to our members, to all working families. Today, we have a private space race among a handful of billionaires. And did you know Elon Musk’s private companies received nearly $5 billion of our tax dollars? Did we get a widely shared return of that investment? No. Our lives were put at risk. Musk ignored local health orders and at least 450 workers at Tesla in California were infected with COVID-19. And before that Tesla threatened and fired employees for organizing. This is what we mean when we say we need to balance the scales. And to do that we need the PRO Act and the public sector PRO Act right alongside it to make sure the jobs created with our tax dollars are well-paid, union jobs, that worker voice and perspective is included in technology and innovation. And that union-busting corporations are held accountable with real penalties. Polls tell us that 60 million people want to join a union. Young workers, workers in emerging industries, exploited gig workers and people working as “independent” contractors who are misclassified and being denied their rights want unions. You all know, the tech sector is one of the biggest growth sectors where there is essentially zero union density. But a recent survey found that HALF of all tech workers want a union. More than any other generation in the workforce, millennials are the most interested in joining unions, more than 60%. IFPTE members are innovators. You work on the cutting edge. Can you see it? This is our opportunity. This is how we grow! But with labor laws broken like they are today more than half of workers in the U.S. are threatened with losing their jobs if they try to form a union. One in FIVE are fired. You know this— we see it in organizing campaigns all the time. Look at Southern California Edison. Corporate management spent millions to intimidate and deny workers their right to have a union. Well our friends in Congress are renaming the PRO Act after our beloved leader. We’re going to start calling it the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize Act and we’re going to pass it.Because it’s about fairness, it's about our freedom to choose. What’s at stake is the future of work and the technology shaping it. The focus on new technology can’t be at the expense of the humans who are working to actually allow that innovation to function in the real world. One example. A hospital introduced technology to try and predict the patients’ risk of sepsis. But the tech development team didn’t involve the nurses. So when the technology was put to use not only were nurses doing their regular, demanding work of caring for the patient, but they also had to do technology repair work. We want technology to help us, not hold us back. And the way we do that is by including worker voice in the research and development process. By including worker voice in deciding how technology is developed it leads to better decisions about how the technology is used, and of course the jobs that flow from new technology.I think of this as collective creation. That means at every stage—not just at the end, as an afterthought—innovation should have input from the humans who will be using the technology on the job. Paul thank you for leading on the AFL-CIO’s Future of Work Commission—which looked at these issues and made recommendations on how to unlock organizing potential. The commission also recommended we launch a technology institute, which I’m thrilled to say we did earlier this year—to make technology work for working people. Because this really is our moment. We have a once-in-a-generation chance to get it right. Everyone included. No community left behind. American-made industries, American supply-chains. Organizing on an unprecedented scale. High labor standards, worker perspective and voice in every step of the innovation process, those are key to the 21st Century vision for America’s future. And as we make major national investments in infrastructure, in families, in the science and technology research that will seed future American industries. We need the Richard Trumka PRO Act. To make sure jobs now and jobs on the horizon in those new industries will be good, union jobs. To make sure the clean energy future and American innovation are union-made. And to lift up worker voice and perspective so that we benefit from our taxpayer investments. Because this isn’t just about unions. It’s about the fundamental economic power of working people in the United States. Engineers, scientists, biologists, chemists, nonprofit employees, researchers, lawyers, programmers—all working people—deserve to have a voice on the job. That’s what those thousands of engineers and other white collar workers understood when they walked out of Boeing in 2000. It wasn’t just for the pay. It was about the future of the labor movement.That’s the future we’re building right now, on the shoulders of giants like Paul, and the legacy of Richard Trumka.Together, we will innovate, we will organize, and we will grow.  I can’t wait to see where we go from here. Thank you!

104,Trumka to Warrior Met Rally: Solidarity Forever!,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-warrior-met-rally-solidarity-forever,8-2-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks via video for the Warrior Met Rally in Alabama: Hi brothers and sisters. I'm Rich Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO and I’m also president emeritus of the UMWA, proud third-generation coal miner and a member of United Mine Workers, Local 6290.And I stand with my brothers and sisters at Warrior Met.I stand with you today. I stand with you tomorrow. And I’ll stand with you for as long as it takes to win a fair contract. And I want to say that your 12.5 million brothers and sisters of the labor movement will stand with you for as long as it takes for you to win a fair contract. When you’ve been working alongside your fellow workers two miles underground, when you’ve been watching each other’s backs and fighting for your rights on the job, you truly trust and understand each other in a very, very fundamental way.You understand that because you’ve lived that.That’s why you sacrificed so immensely for your communities in Alabama.And that’s why you work tirelessly each and every day.And that’s why you’re on strike today!Warrior Met or BlackRock have never led the lives that we have.But it’s time for them to recognize our reality.To pay us a fair wage. To provide us with good benefits. To give us a fair contract now! And nothing, I mean NOTHING LESS, is acceptable.And don't tell us that it’s too much to ask for. Don’t tell us that can’t be done!You see, you, brothers and sisters, are the reason for Warrior’s prosperity! And we will not sacrifice our dignity for their profit!And that, quite frankly, is what this strike is all about.Brothers and sisters banding together and demanding better.Better is what we need. And better is what we’ve earned. And better is what we will get if we make the PRO Act the law of the land.You see, for decades, big businesses and anti-worker politicians have chipped away at our rights. They’ve tried to take away our power.Well I could tell you something, they won’t win. And neither will Warrior Met. You see, it's time to regrow America’s labor movement, to restore our rights .and to reclaim our power!It’s time for a fair contract!To Warrior Met and all the union-busters out there: No matter how much you try to intimidate us, no matter how hard you try to break us, working people are not going to give in or cave in or capitulate! We're not going to give in and we won’t give up.We will prevail.One day longer. One day stronger. WE’RE ONE!God bless you. Take care! Solidarity forever!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
105,Trumka to LCLAA Convention: We Are Waging the Fight for Democracy ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-lclaa-convention-we-are-waging-fight-democracy,8-2-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks via video to LCLAA's 23rd National Membership Convention in Las Vegas:Good afternoon, LCLAA delegates and friends. Let me begin by thanking Sister Yanira.It is an honor to be introduced by the first woman and the first immigrant to head LCLAA.We all know Yanira’s fighting spirit. We all know LCLAA is cultivating the groundwork for an equitable and just recovery. So, it should come as no surprise that LCLAA has been on the forefront of some of our toughest battles, and has helped to deliver critical victories for working people.To start, our work made Donald Trump a one-term president! And all our phone calls and door knocks elected the most pro-union president since Franklin D. Roosevelt.But this election season did not end in November. No! We regrouped and remobilized to keep the momentum going in Georgia. We defied the odds. We prevailed! Today, there is a pro-worker majority in the Senate. And we made that possible! LCLAA played a vital role expanding and diversifying the electorate.And you did that despite massive and powerful forces seeking to snuff out the rights of working people, especially workers of color.That’s because you refused to stay silent or stand down. Because of our tenacity, we have a generational opportunity to work with a pro-union president and a pro-worker Congress.This is our time to take on issues critical to our lives and livelihoods. No more waiting. No more next time. This is our time.And we’ve got to make this count.It won’t be easy, but we’ve already gotten results. The American Rescue Plan was the most important piece of legislation passed since the New Deal. Think about it. That single piece of legislation is going to cut child poverty in half. That’s monumental. And the American Rescue Plan was just the opening round.Now we need this Congress to pass the PRO Act to rewrite 100-year-old labor laws that are hurting working people, not helping us.We need to deliver on infrastructure, protect our sacred voting rights and put working families on a long overdue path to citizenship.When you boil it down, the fight we are waging today is the fight for democracy, which we all know has been under siege.It’s not a coincidence that the opponents of democracy are also anti-worker politicians. The politicians who have spent decades dividing and weakening working people. Tearing us apart by race. Weakening social protection programs. And fighting our unions with everything they have.Our message to them is simple: Your time is up.Democracy must exist at the ballot box, and also in the workplace.In the United States and countries around the world, working people are clamoring for:Together, we are going to keep winning policies that work for every worker with no exclusions—from the domestic worker to the gig worker, the teacher to the construction worker.Now is our time to create a new economy that works for workers. All workers! Give us back our power and we’ll pull our country back from the brink.The prescription to heal us and have a just and robust recovery is finally fixing the systems that have failed working people—whether they’re political, economic or social.That’s why the labor movement has never been more important than we are today. And we have never been more ready for what we must do.Change is coming to America. I can feel it. In elections won. In a labor movement that is growing more popular and powerful by the day.But we can’t settle down or slow our roll. We can’t find comfort in the taste of victory. We must push ourselves and push our society forward.In the coming years, when we look back on these days, let us be able to say we rebuilt our country and our democracy.That we banded together to collectively bargain for working people today—and for generations to come.That we returned power to the hands of the workers.This is our time! This is our moment! WE are North America’s labor movement and we will not—WE WILL NOT—be denied! Thank you! God bless you! And stay safe!

106,Trumka: A United Labor Movement Runs Deep in the Heart of Texas,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-united-labor-movement-runs-deep-heart-texas,7-27-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks as prepared at the 2021 Texas AFL-CIO Virtual Constitutional Convention:Brother Rick Levy, I appreciate that gracious introduction. And I’m immensely grateful to you, Brother Leonard Aguilar and all our union family in Texas for inviting me to kick off your convention.Next year, we will do this in person!My fellow union members, make no mistake about it: The labor movement in Texas is growing more powerful.In one of the toughest states to organize, the Texas AFL-CIO is building back together.And empowering working people—whether they are members of our unions or one day hope to be.The anti-worker attacks have not discouraged you! The uphill climb has not stopped you.Since the pandemic hit, you’ve done the hard work. You’ve made your voices louder. And you’ve made your communities and state stronger.So it should come as no surprise that America is turning toward the values of unionism. And it’s not happening by chance. It’s happening because of your efforts. Serving on the front lines. Mobilizing our members. Organizing and growing our movement. The power of a united labor movement runs deep in the heart of Texas. Look what happened last week.Working people at the Pilgrim’s Pride plant in Waco voted overwhelmingly to join UFCW Local 540.They voted for family-sustaining wages! For workplace projections! For a fair share of the prosperity they create each and every day!And now, first contract negotiations are underway.This is a testament to the purpose and power of a strong organizing campaign.I’m told the company did not engage in interference or deploy intimidation tactics. Brothers and sisters, I say it’s about damn time. That should be the norm, not the exception.And yet, we know workers who band together to try to improve their lives are often met with retaliation and threats and loss of employment. The shameful silencing of working people has denied dignity to millions of working people. It has profoundly hurt our economy and our country.Since the National Labor Relations Act was signed by FDR in 1935, there has been a full-fledged attack on working people. And what is the outcome? Wages have been crushed for decades as corporations enrich themselves. A rigged tax system was created so billionaires pay nothing, and teachers and firefighters and construction workers pick up the bill. Runaway inequality has soared to unfathomable levels. The inequality of wealth and wages, opportunity, and most of all, power.And let’s not forget, inequality is the greatest threat to democracy.It should shock nobody that our democracy is hanging by a thread. Private equity billionaires are funding legal attacks on voting rights while state lawmakers are trying to pass voter suppression bills.These threats to democracy are a crisis. And during a crisis, it can’t be business as usual. That’s why this state federation has rallied for voting rights and labor rights. That’s why a delegation of your state lawmakers courageously fled Texas to block a cowardly voter suppression bill.   Two weeks ago, we were proud to welcome the Texas Democratic Delegation to the House of Labor on Black Lives Matter Plaza.Together, we sent a clear message: this fight is about our vote and our voice!Without the right to vote and without the right to organize, there is no democracy.The survival of democracy anywhere depends on working people to defend it everywhere.Every time past generations of working people were called on to save it, they met the moment. Now is our moment to save our rights in the country we built.And that includes the right to organize!It is time for 21st-century labor laws. It is time for big corporations to play by the rules on a level playing field.It’s time for the Senate to pass the PRO Act so that the 60 million workers who want to join a union right now can do so freely and fairly. In Texas. Everywhere.Over the past year and a half, Texas has been lifted by the resilience and courage of working people. The nurse who tends to the sick. The grocery clerk who stocks the shelves. The electrician who restores power.Brothers and sisters, you are the people who are holding Texas together. You are building back together.And we know better than anyone that a union protects our safety on the job and uplifts the dignity of our work.Every working person deserves the protections and power that come with a union card. At its core, that’s what the PRO Act is all about.This bipartisan legislation has passed the House not once, but twice.And while this is not an election year, I don’t want Texas to forget who voted against it twice: Congressman Henry Cuellar.Cuellar is the Koch brothers’ henchman. Look at the FEC reports. The Koch brothers lined his pockets with over $30,000 just to help him win his primary.In exchange, he sided with them and voted against us. We need to make this his last term.  Look, this is more proof the corporate right-wing will challenge us at every turn.I say, bring it on! We’re spoiling for a fight. We've taken their best shot, and we're still standing.Nobody and nothing can defeat or deny a united labor movement!In May of 1964, President Lyndon Johnson shared his vision of a Great Society. It was a vision of health and education and American community. But more than anything else, it was a vision built on the idea that—together—we have the agency to make our future.President Johnson said: “There are those timid souls who say this battle cannot be won; that we are condemned to a soulless wealth. I do not agree. We have the power to shape the civilization that we want. But we need your will, your labor, your heart.”Brothers and sisters, working people are hungry for a greater society. And the Texas AFL-CIO has the will, the labor and the heart to guide us there!This is our time and our country. We’ll organize and mobilize and educate for it. We’ll build back together! We’ll win a greater society for working people.Today. Tomorrow. For as long as it takes, we’ll fight for unionism to transform Texas!Thank you! God bless you, and stay safe!

107, Trumka to Boilermakers: The PRO Act Is About Our Democracy ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-boilermakers-pro-act-about-our-democracy,7-21-2021,"Brothers and sisters, good afternoon.Let me tell you: It’s not common for a proud Penn State Nittany Lion to receive such a warm reception from a group of Boilermakers!Before I continue, I need to start by thanking Brother Newton Jones and Brother William Creeden, along with your five international vice presidents: Lawrence McManamon, J. Tom Baca, Warren Fairley, John T. Fultz and Arnie Stadnick.  It’s a tremendous honor to address the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers.This union’s history is rooted in resilience.Following a decade of disastrous economic policies and a decline in union membership, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave America a New Deal.  And when the second World War threatened American democracy, it was the Boilermakers who helped save it. This union went to work around the clock, building the ships, ramping up wartime production in a moment of maximum crisis.And growing union membership and strengthening workers’ rights!Today, America is turning the corner in a battle against a different kind of enemy: a deadly virus.What has not changed is the level of devotion from the Boilermakers.Throughout this pandemic, you’ve been on the front lines in the fight to promote workplace safety and protect the pensions that we earned through a lifetime of service.Now it’s time to once again make sure working people don’t just get by, it’s time to make sure working people can get ahead.But that’s not possible when runaway inequality is skyrocketing.We won’t solve the inequality of wealth and wages and the inequality of opportunity unless we confront the inequality of power.Simply put, workers are too weak. Corporations are too powerful.The longer this imbalance continues, the heavier the burden becomes. And if we keep doing the same thing, our economic and political systems will come crashing down on us.The PRO Act is how we address the inequality of power in America and finally level the playing field for working people.At its core, the PRO Act is about empowering working people with freedom. The freedom to band together on the job. The freedom to have a voice at work. The freedom to form a union without being pressured or threatened or fired.Sixty million people would join a union today if given the chance. An MIT study confirmed that before the pandemic, and I’d wager that number is even higher today.But America’s outdated labor laws are robbing millions of workers of the union difference. Good wages. Great benefits. A secure retirement. And by the way, those labor laws are even older than the ships a mighty generation of Boilermakers built to beat Nazis and fascists in World War II. FDR gave us a New Deal. The PRO Act is how we renew that deal. It’s about our economy. And we know an economy thrives on fairness but crumbles under the weight of inequality.The PRO Act is about our safety. All of us should be able to go to work free from fear and return home safely when we finish our shift. It’s about our voice. And when union membership is larger, our voice grows louder! Think about the debates this country is having over infrastructure and energy. Without the Boilermakers, America can’t build modern marvels to compete against the world. And we certainly won’t defeat climate change without the Boilermakers at the table!And the PRO Act is about our democracy. Look, I respect the fact that you have not endorsed in the past few presidential elections. This union has made it clear: “your vote is a personal decision.” But here’s what I think we can all agree on: No matter who you vote for, every American has the right to vote!That’s not liberal or conservative belief. That is a fundamental freedom in this country. That is a cornerstone of American democracy.But right now, over 400 voter suppression bills have been introduced in state legislatures across America.Those lawmakers will say it’s about protecting our elections from voter fraud. But there is no evidence of voter fraud...just baseless allegations and conspiracy theories.  Here’s the truth: these laws are about making sure certain Americans don’t vote or can’t vote or won’t have their vote counted.I can’t think of anything more un-American than denying a fellow American of their right to the ballot.I don’t care if you’re a Democrat or a Republican or an Independent, these bills should outrage you. As a union member. As a champion for democracy. As an American.As one united labor movement, we need to do everything in our power to stop these un-American laws and strengthen our democracy—because democracy is not promised to the next generation.We demand better, brothers and sisters. We demand dignity, rights, respect and a union for every worker—in construction and manufacturing, shipbuilding and railroads—in all the industries you represent.We demand labor laws designed to strengthen America’s labor movement, not weaken it.And we demand that our democracy is preserved and passed on to the next generation of working people!We can make it happen by standing together, marching together, fighting together, shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, as long as it takes. For Boilermakers and all workers! For America’s labor movement! For this country we built and love! God bless you. And thank you.

108,Trumka to Washington State Labor Council Convention: America Is Looking to Us for Leadership,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-washington-state-labor-council-convention-america-looking-us-leadership,7-21-2021,"Good evening! Thank you Brother Larry [Brown], for that kind introduction and your steadfast leadership. I also want to thank my sister April [Sims] for your incredible work fighting for justice.It’s a real pleasure for me to be with you tonight.Your work has inspired me, your dedication has kept Washington together through crisis after crisis after crisis.We’re starting to turn a corner. Seattle—the first epicenter of COVID-19 in America—now has one of the highest vaccination rates and one of the lowest infection rates of any major city in the country. The same is true for Washington as a whole.That’s thanks to the work each of you has done to promote the vaccine and get shots into arms. The Washington State Labor Council, Teamsters 117, MLK Labor with local unions and labor bodies came together to host vaccination drives.Your mission was clear: focus on the front-line workers who keep our communities going.The labor movement in Washington—each of you—is saving lives, changing lives, making lives better...and that’s something to be damn proud of!But as we turn the corner on the worst days of this pandemic, we know the work is far from over.People who work in hospitality and entertainment and many other industries are still suffering from widespread job losses.And I know unions like UNITE HERE, IATSE and the American Federation of Musicians are fighting to ensure our members keep their health insurance, peace of mind and dignity.Look, you’ve been on the front lines since day one of this pandemic.We all know the airline and aerospace industries have been gut punched. We’ve suffered drastic production cuts because of the pandemic.As air travel increases and manufacturing ramps up, it’s time for Boeing to put the Machinists and members of SPEEA/IFPTE back to work!We won’t let them ship production to other countries and send our jobs to non-union shops. Hell no! Not today. Not ever.Sisters and brothers, despite all the challenges we’ve been through, we’re standing together and getting stronger. Our calling now is to pass the most transformative labor law reform in generations. The PRO Act is our goal and nothing will stop us from getting it passed.This landmark legislation will completely change the rules of the game.It will rebalance our economy and strengthen our democracy so workers have more power, and ensure more workers have a seat at the table.The sad fact is that corporations are too strong, and workers are too weak. The PRO Act will change that once and for all.The PRO Act will lift up workers of color, who have been disproportionately hurt by COVID-19 and the economic crisis.And most importantly, it will revitalize our movement!Making organizing and bargaining easier and growing our union ranks for generations to come.But I’m here to give it to you straight: we need your help to pass the PRO Act. We can’t afford to have anyone sitting on the sidelines during this PRO Act Week of Action. Patty Murray wrote the PRO Act. Her bill is our bill. And our fight must be her fight. So thank your senators and representatives who are supporting the PRO Act.And more than that, encourage them to urge the few undecided senators to come on board.We won’t get what we don’t fight for!Across this country, 60 million working people would join a union today if they could.Think about the immense power we already have. To fight for our members. To shape policy. To change minds.Then imagine what more could happen if union density finally matched union desire.You see, the PRO Act is only possible because of the work you all did in the swing states to elect Joe Biden, the most pro-worker president we’ve ever had. The labor movement held our pro-union majority in the House and flipped the Senate after we went all-in on the Georgia runoffs.The Washington State Labor Council knows all about electing champions for working people.Your state’s entire Democratic delegation has been key to the PRO Act.And you’re expanding workers’ rights on the state level!You joined forces with the United Farm Workers and allies to pass the first law in the nation that will provide all farmworkers with the overtime pay they deserve.But you didn’t stop there. When faced with drastic spending cuts at the state level, you joined forces with allies to pass a new capital gains tax.The wealthy have made out like bandits during this pandemic. Now it’s time for millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share.If a Washington resident can afford to build a rocket and go to the edge of space, he damn well can afford to pay his fair share in taxes.Firefighters and teachers and construction workers should not be paying more in taxes than the world’s most powerful company. Brothers and sisters, Americans are not just looking to us for leadership, they are listening to what we have to say.So make your voices heard! COVID tore back the curtain and exposed the truth of our economy. A truth that America’s workers have lived for far too long.You see, the truth is America’s economy hasn’t been working for working people. And it’s threatening democracy itself.Right now, we are facing a coordinated attempt across the country to curtail voting rights and make it harder for working people to express our voice at the ballot box.Some are continuing to sow doubt in our elections by holding what they call “audits.”In many states, we’re fighting attempts to pass voter suppression laws—little more than Jim Crow 2.0.I’m pleased to say Washington is doing just the opposite: Your state is leading the way with one of the best and most accessible voting systems in the nation.We in the labor movement know that race has always been used as a wedge to divide us.But we refuse to be divided along racial lines. We will always stand together as one family with one common purpose!
The Washington State Labor Council, under the leadership of Sister April [Sims], has taken on the difficult task of educating union members about the history of racism both inside and outside of the labor movement.There’s a lot of debate around what’s called critical race theory being taught in schools.The American Federation of Teachers has put it plainly: teachers don’t even teach critical race theory. Teachers do teach honest history and they should be allowed to do so.We won’t ignore our history. If we do, we are doomed to repeat it.Our opponents want to take us back to Jim Crow and right to work and separate but equal. But we are never going back. The labor movement won't allow it.Brothers and sisters, this is our moment, this is our calling.To provide a better life for our families.To lift up workers who are being left behind by the billionaires and giant corporations.To build better and more resilient communities.Because that’s what unions have always done. I’ve lived it. I’m here because of it.  We know who we are and we are ready for our date with destiny.Corporations tried to knock us out. But we’re still standing.The cynics tried to count us out. But we’re still standing. The bigots tried to shut us out. But we’re still standing. Through COVID-19 and an insurrection. Through union busting and attacks on our right to vote. So I have a message tonight. To the anti-worker Republicans and the weak-kneed Democrats, to the opponents of unions and the enemies of democracy: WE ARE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!This is our country. We build it. We serve it. We run it. And we’re ready to save it. Democracy for all. Unions for all. Justice for all. We are the American labor movement and we will not—WE WILL NOT—be denied! Thank you and God bless you.

109,Trumka to South Carolina AFL-CIO Convention: The PRO Act Is a Game-Changer,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-south-carolina-afl-cio-convention-pro-act-game-changer,7-19-2021,"Brothers and sisters, good evening. It is an honor to join South Carolina’s 65th annual convention. My only regret is I am not able to join you in person. To shake your hands. To give you a big hug. To enjoy some South Carolina barbeque! But I am very grateful to Brother Charles [Brave Jr.] for inviting me tonight.And before I continue, I want to acknowledge the contributions of your secretary-treasurer, Mike Godfrey. Brother Mike, thank you for 25 years of service to this state federation, and congratulations on your well-deserved retirement. From one proud grandfather to another, I hope you get more time with your grandchildren. And never forget: your life’s work will let your grandchildren grow up in a state—and a country—where workers have more dignity. God bless you, Brother Mike!Brothers and sisters, this convention is happening during the AFL-CIO’s PRO Act Week of Action. Over the next several days, we are having an action at the offices of all 100 U.S. senators this week. ONLY the labor movement can do that. I can’t think of a better moment to come together to renew our commitment to America’s workers. And America’s workers need South Carolina.Look, I know you’re running against the wind.You have a power-hungry former governor who sold her soul to Donald Trump after she sold off the state to big businesses.You have a governor who said the labor movement is—and I quote—“about as welcome as a Category Five hurricane.” And you have not one but two senators who represent the interests of corporations that line their pockets—not the interests of the working people who power South Carolina.Anti-worker politicians like them are the reason runaway inequality skyrocketed. The inequality of wealth and wages. The inequality of opportunity. And the inequality of power. Right now, the rich and corporations are way too powerful. And working people are way too weak.If you need a textbook example, look at Giti Tires. Brother Fred Redmond can tell you all about them.We know Governor McMaster brought the company to Chester County in 2017. He incentivized Giti with massive tax cuts. He enticed them with right to work and other anti-worker policies. Giti promised to bring jobs and prosperity to Chester County. Today, South Carolina knows what we’ve always known: It was a giant scam.When the pandemic hit, Giti took millions of dollars in PPP loans and gave workers the shaft. Hundreds of workers lost their livelihoods because the company felt it could act with impunity.  Brothers and sisters, it is time to change the power dynamics in South Carolina and across America. I’ve got a message for Nikki Haley, .Henry McMaster, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott: America is sick and tired of your tax cuts for big businesses and the fortunate few. America is turning to the labor movement—the people who wake our country up every single day and keep her running late into the night. More than 60 million Americans would join a union today if they could. But in places like South Carolina, having a fair election is nearly impossible. Our labor laws are a century old. Today, these laws are weakening America’s labor movement, not helping us. And the courts have relentlessly whittled away our rights for decades.That’s why we need the PRO Act! It puts power back into our hands—the hands of working people.Look, you’ve probably heard me or President Brave say that before.But I want you to understand what the PRO Act does and why it’s a game changer for union members—and working people who want to be union members.The PRO Act would allow workers to form a union freely and fairly. No more propaganda campaigns. No more scare tactics. No more intimidation.It would make sure that workers can reach a first contract quickly after our union is recognized. It would end the practice of hiring permanent replacements. The days of firing workers who strike would be over. It would hold corporations responsible if they deny us our right to band together and form a union. And it would finally—finally—ban right to work once and for all. In South Carolina. In every single state. Simply put, right to work leads to poverty, inequality and death. You know that.But let’s not forget: The roots of right to work go back to the Jim Crow-era. It was designed to divide working people by race—to separate white workers from Black workers and to make us all poorer.When we pass the PRO Act, right to work is going in the ash heap of history where it belongs. And South Carolina’s local unions better be ready to print more union cards!We know what comes with a union card. World-class apprenticeships. Family-sustaining wages. Strong workplace protections. A dignified retirement. But it’s even more than that. As union members, we know we are stronger together. When you mess with one of us, you mess with all of us. When union membership is higher, worker power is greater! Our benefits are better! Our voices are louder!The PRO Act has our opponents running scared. The employer community is calling it a “power grab.”You’re damn right it’s a power grab. They have too much power. And we don’t have enough. And we are grabbing power back.We’ve waited long enough. This is OUR time. I know you’re rallying in front of the statehouse to demand the PRO Act.But we need to keep going after that rally ends. Send those postcards. Educate your members. Make phone calls to your senators.I know, I know. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott have said they will vote against the PRO Act. But don’t let up on them.You may not be able to change their minds, but you sure as hell have the power to make them worry.Let me tell you how things work in the Senate.Your senators listen to what you don’t say as much as what you do say.They’re expecting us to give up on them and move on.If we’re ringing their phones off the hook and if we’re outside their offices in full force, we’ll show them the power of a united labor movement.Let them hear what working people have to say because Tim Scott is not just running for re-election in 2022, he’s positioning himself to run for president in 2024. And Lindsey Graham? Well, he is just trying to be taken seriously by anybody.So let’s hold them accountable. This is a moment for unions because it’s a moment made by unions.If you want to end business as usual in South Carolina, if you want to win a new era for all of America’s workers, if you want to guarantee that all work has dignity, let’s show our power during this week of action! And let’s get the PRO Act across the finish line!    Thank you. And God bless you.

Thank you to you and all of your colleagues for your courage and your determination. Hello, everyone.It’s an honor to bring the voices of the 12.5 million working people in the AFL-CIO, all across our country and our economy who are standing up, fighting for the rights and dignity of all working people. As Rich and everyone have said, a year ago Saturday, we lost a giant.I can still hear John Lewis telling that story about weathering a storm in his tin-roof house in Troy, Alabama.If you ever heard the Congressman speak you know it. He was with family and through this storm it felt like the house would uproot and blow away.But wherever the house lifted from its foundation--one corner, another corner--everyone in the house would stand together, running from side to side to hold it down.And John Lewis said, the wind may blow. The thunder may roll. The lightning may flash. But never, ever, leave the house.He said, we live in the same house. Black, white, all ages, faiths, genders. We are one people, one family, one house.Well, in our House, voting rights and labor rights are one.Economic justice and racial justice go hand in hand.And today, we are standing together against the storm that is trying to uproot our rights, our freedoms, our very democracy.We’re facing a fundamental assault by extremist lawmakers on voting rights at the ballot box. And at the same time, big corporations are using every tactic they can think of to bust unions and deny workers’ rights to vote in their workplaces to join a union.It’s not a coincidence. Where there are attacks on unions, there are attacks on voting rights.And these attacks are targeted especially to hurt and disenfranchise Black and brown people.But we won’t let these racist, systematic efforts deny us our rights, freedom or power.Like Congressman John Lewis said, the vote is the most powerful non-violent tool we have in a democracy, and we must use it.In 2020, we did. We voted in record numbers. We elected the most pro-union President and Vice President. A pro-worker majority in the U.S. House.And thanks to the relentless hard work of organizers in Georgia--two wins, which critics said were impossible--we also have a pro-worker majority in the U.S. Senate.
 
Those pro-labor champions delivered a rescue plan, including the largest child tax credit ever and historic relief for working families.And now we need action to protect our voting and organizing rights and with it, our democracy.It’s urgent. We can’t wait.Today, and every day moving forward, we call on the Senate to pass the PRO Act, pass voter protection legislation and defend our rights and freedom to vote at the ballot box and in our workplaces.That’s how, through this storm, we will protect our House where it stands on Black Lives Matter Plaza, and what it stands for: workers' rights. Economic and racial justice. The ongoing march that John Lewis took so very far, and that we are dedicated to continuing.Thank you. Back to Rich, who will take questions.

Watch the press conference here.Good morning. Welcome to the House of Labor. Here on Black Lives Matter Plaza. In the shadow of the White House. One year ago, in the wake of the protests that happened on this street against racial injustice, America lost one of our greatest guardians of democracy: Congressman John Lewis.Take a look at this picture. The determination. The passion. The humility. I feel John with us today. I feel his love. I feel his fight. I feel his hope for what we can do together. And I feel his anger at what is happening all around us. John’s devotion to democracy brought him within an inch of death. But Congressman Lewis lived, and he lived to fight for us. Now we must honor that legacy. With action. John Lewis understood the link between democracy at the ballot box and democracy in the workplace.Without the right to vote, there is no democracy. Without the right to form a union, there is no democracy. Nothing less than our freedom is on the line. The labor movement is appalled at the attacks on voting happening across the country. And let's call it like it is: The target of this suppression is overwhelmingly Black and Brown Americans. That was not a coincidence during Jim Crow, and it is not a coincidence today.That’s why the Texas state delegation is in Washington, D.C. and with us today.They are heroically blocking voter suppression legislation, but they are also giving U.S. senators a clear and common sense assignment: protect voting rights now for Texans and all Americans! The labor movement is also appalled at the attacks on unions in America, from Jim Crow right to work laws to the Janus Supreme Court case to union-busting at Amazon. Those attacking voting and those attacking unions are one and the same, what Dr. King called “a twin-headed creature spewing anti-Negro epithets from one mouth and anti-labor propaganda from the other mouth.”These are the founding fathers of January 6. And massive inequality of income, opportunity and power. And the purging of voter rolls. And we are going to fight them together. On every single front. With everything we have.Democracy is not promised. It has to be protected when it's threatened. It has to be perfected so it can be passed onto the next generation. John Lewis' life taught us that. It has become clearer than ever: to save American democracy, we need democracy in the U.S. Senate. And that means passing labor law reform and voter protection legislation with a simple 50-vote majority. We cannot allow the minority to block the will of the American people, expressed decisively in the 2020 elections. And we cannot afford to let any of our agenda—from democracy in the workplace to democracy at the ballot box to investments in our people—fall victim to a procedural tool conceived in segregation.It has become clear that one of two things must be pushed aside: the filibuster or the hopes and aspirations of the American people.  The choice is crystal clear. This is a time for the Senate to be courageous and lead...by clearing the way for the PRO Act, S.1, and the entire Workers First Agenda to move forward together. Some will say that’s impossible. But every time our democracy has been threatened, Americans found a way to save it. John Lewis devoted his life to strengthening it. When John Lewis marched on Washington…When he marched across the Edmund Pettus in Selma...When he marched through the halls of Congress...John Lewis marched for us.The faithful marches Congressman Lewis led...the moral convictions he embodied...we must carry those forward today.It’s our turn to pass this test.Democracy for All. That’s what we’re fighting for. And together, with the labor and civil rights movements locked arm in arm, we are going to win it. Thank you.

112,Shuler Launches 2021 AFL-CIO Executive Paywatch,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-launches-2021-afl-cio-executive-paywatch,7-14-2021,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks on a press call announcing the 2021 Executive Paywatch. Hello everyone, thank you for joining us for the launch of this year’s AFL-CIO Executive Paywatch website. We’ve been doing this now for many years, and it keeps getting better and really highlights the disparities we in the labor movement talk about day in and day out. I want to thank Brandon Rees, the AFL-CIO’s Deputy Director of Corporations and Capital Markets for his hard work in bringing this important project to life.The headline is: In 2020, on average, CEOs of S&P 500 companies were given a big raise. They received $15.5 million in total compensation. Compared to 2019, that’s a pay increase of more than $700,000, during the worst public health crisis in a century.And the only reason we’re reaching the other side of the COVID-19 pandemic is because working people stepped up. Our first responders, county and municipal workers, food and retail—think about the sacrifices—transportation workers, construction, manufacturing, communication workers. Educators. Nurses and health care workers. Postal workers and Letter carriers. And so many more. I could go on.We hear so many business leaders calling those workers “essential” and “heroes.” But words are not enough. We’ve always been essential, doing the critical work to make this country hum. And what every worker deserves is family-sustaining wages a free and clear path to stand together with our co-workers in unions. Because unions are the best way to improve working conditions, increase wages, win safety protection, fight discrimination and guarantee equal pay.That’s why we need the PRO Act. It would fix our labor laws, remove barriers like the fear of getting fired that workers face when they try to stand together with coworkers in a union. The PRO Act is how we can reclaim our bargaining rights on a level playing field.Some companies furloughed working people, then tried to make a big deal about cutting CEO’s base salaries.But in reality, CEOs enjoyed big increases in their equity compensation. While CEO base salaries decreased slightly, the average S&P 500 company CEO’s stock-based pay increased by over $1 million. And that doesn’t even factor in the dramatic rise in the stock market we saw in the second half of the year. Many of these CEO’s stock grants were made when the stock market bottomed out in March 2020, meaning these shares are now worth even more today. And as the Institute for Policy Studies recently pointed out, dozens of S&P 500 companies actually increased their CEO’s pay.  Some companies gave “retention” awards to their CEOs as their stock prices fell, while others changed their CEO’s incentive metrics to make up for the impact of COVID-19.On average, in 2020 at S&P 500 companies, CEO pay increased by 5 percent while the disclosed median employee’s pay at those same companies only increased by 1 percent. As a result, from 2019 to 2020, the average CEO-to-worker pay ratio of S&P 500 companies increased:In 2019, it was 264-to-1.In 2020, it was 299-to-1. That’s what we mean when we say inequality is skyrocketing. While CEO pay was growing, working people were risking their lives and livelihoods. We also faced extreme unemployment rates—they peaked in April 2020—at 14.7 percent with a record 41 million U.S. layoffs. While many jobs have returned, there was a net loss of 9 million jobs in 2020.The pandemic economically devastated those who were already hurting the most. It pushed millions of women, predominantly Black and Latina women out of the workforce.Without the support provided by increased federal unemployment benefits and economic stimulus we would have faced a second Great Depression.That’s why the labor movement fought hard for the passage of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan to bring relief to all working families. It includes the Child Tax Credit—one of the greatest lifelines working families have to help make ends meet. That piece of relief will start reaching families as of tomorrow. And what we need next is the PRO Act.That’s crystal clear in this year’s Paywatch, which shines a spotlight on the difference between companies in so-called “right to work” states versus those in union security states. “Right to work” laws take away workers’ rights. They undermine our freedom to come together in unions. They were first adopted in the 1940s, part of an effort to maintain Jim Crow in the South. Segregationists wanted to keep unions from organizing Black and white workers together. It’s a racist, systematic effort to divide us, to deny us our power.  Because they know that our strength is our solidarity. In every single state, the PRO Act would end divisive right to work laws. A company’s headquarters might not be in the same state where the majority of its workforce is located. But it’s clear, right-to-work has a disturbing effect. The average CEO-to-worker pay ratio of Russell 3000 companies that are headquartered in “right to work” states is 173-to-1.Compared to union security states, it’s 133-to-1.The median worker’s pay of the average Russell 3000 company headquartered in a “right to work” state was 22 percent lower compared to companies headquartered in union security states. No wonder these laws are often called the “right to work for less!”These numbers illustrate why passing the PRO Act is so urgent. The PRO Act will remove barriers to organizing, hold companies accountable for violating workers’ rights, and repeal “right to work” laws that lead to lower wages for working people and their families. The CEO-to-worker pay ratio data also show dramatic differences between industries. The highest pay ratios are in the consumer discretionary sector of the economy, that includes many retail companies with low paid workers. The average consumer discretionary company in the S&P 500 Index had a pay ratio of 741-to-1 in 2020.Look at Amazon, the company that fought hard to prevent a predominantly Black workforce in Bessemer, Alabama from unionizing. Amazon’s new CEO as of this month is Andrew Jassy. He received $35.8 million in total compensation in 2020, or 1,234 times that of Amazon’s median worker who made only $29,007 in 2020.In contrast, CEO-to-worker pay ratios are the lowest in the utilities sector. The average utility company in the S&P 500 index had a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of just 97-to-1 in 2020. It’s no coincidence that, according to the Bureau of Labor statistics, 20 percent of utility workers are members of unions.I'm a second generation IBEW. I came out of the utility sector. My father was a power lineman at Portland General Electric and my mother worked there as well. I personally know the union difference.I think people in our country really see the difference a union makes coming out of this pandemic. They see that having a union means health care benefits. Retirement Security. Safety protection. Paid sick leave—in a crisis like the pandemic—and now in record heat waves. Those protections can be life-saving. Every worker should have the right to form a union. And good union jobs must be the rule, not the exception, And passing the PRO Act is the single best way to reverse economic inequality and raise wages for all working people. It’s how we balance the scales before they break. That’s why we are asking all those who are concerned about runaway CEO pay to contact their Senator and urge passage of the PRO Act.I’ll turn it over to Brandon who will walk us through the rest of this year’s Executive Paywatch website.Thank you.

113,Trumka to Labor Energy Partnership: America's Energy Future Can't Exclude Working People,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-labor-energy-partnership-americas-energy-future-cant-exclude-working-people,7-12-2021,"Hello everyone, welcome to the Labor Energy Partnerhsips’s Ohio River Valley Workshop, I’m Rich Trumka, President of the AFL-CIO. Secretary Moniz, thank you for your partnership. More importantly, thank you for showing that America’s energy future cannot exclude working people and leave our communities behind.To our keynote speakers, on behalf of America’s unions, thank you for being here. We hear it from the White House, from the president himself. We see it in Executive Orders, and in the actions of the agencies: Responding to the climate crisis means good-paying, union jobs. That’s what our pro-worker champions are fighting for. See, working people have suffered a long-term hollowing-out of our country’s industrial base.But now we’re at an inflection point. We have an opportunity to define a 21st Century Industrial Policy, to modernize our energy and manufacturing sectors, so our children and grandchildren inherit a livable planet and a broadly-shared prosperity. It starts now. Built in America. In every part of America. Labor will pave the path, and it runs right through the mighty Ohio River Valley. My home town Nemacolin, Pennsylvania is part of the Ohio River watershed.It’s a place where the entire local economy depended on coal. And when the mines closed, the local economy was devastated. Think, really think, about what this means. It’s kids struggling in under-resourced schools. Pensions earned by a lifetime of hard, dangerous work taken by our rotten bankruptcy laws. Entire regions left with no economic driver, in soul-crushing poverty, no hope for the future. And when there is a poverty of hope, people die from deaths of despair. But what we’re talking about today, hydrogen with carbon capture, means we can decarbonize industries without destroying livelihoods and lives. We can use this region’s abundant natural gas resources to create a clean fuel that preserves existing jobs and creates new onesKeeping jobs in steel and concrete and power generation means food on the table. Families in their homes. It means a revival for Ohio River Valley communities, our cultures and traditions.And it shows the county that answering the climate crisis doesn’t have to cost America jobs. It can create them. Jobs building 21st century infrastructure. Jobs establishing geologic storage facilities. Jobs manufacturing the equipment.And here’s the single most important point I want to make. As we talk about and promote these new technologies, we must guarantee worker rights from the start.The fundamental imbalance in our nation, that keeps us from moving faster on climate, on diversity, on justice for all, is the imbalance of power between working people and corporations. The answer to that fundamental imbalance of power is called a labor union. That’s why the most important policy to this discussion today is the PRO Act. It’s a bill that passed the House with bipartisan support—twice. It guarantees a free and fair path to a union.If our rights, dignity and power are at the center of the clean energy transition... We will create widespread opportunities, lift each other up—out of poverty, away from the margins, into a new era of hope and possibilities.  The single greatest key is passing the PRO Act. Because if you empower us, we will be the most powerful answer to the threat of a changing climate...union labor will build the most resilient infrastructure and supply chains. And it’s time for a revival. For every person and every place in America. Especially for the Ohio River Valley.I have been saying for years: the key to moving faster on climate change is to give workers the rights and the power we need to make all the new jobs good jobs.Workers and communities need to know that we are doing this with them, and for them; it’s not something we are doing to them.That’s why this discussion today is so important. We’re grateful to have you. Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka

You push the envelope. You invest in change. You drive activism. You make a difference. When I was young, and working in a coal mine, I thought a lot about what I would do with my life. I was drawn to the labor movement for one simple reason: I believed there was no greater force for economic and social justice than workers coming together in unions to exercise our collective power. I experienced the union difference...in my own family...my own community...and across our country. But in the years since, those rights have been hacked away. Workers who try to improve their lives are far too often met with retaliation, intimidation, loss of employment, and the list goes on. And this silencing of working people has profoundly hurt our country and threatened our democracy. But working people have fought back. All my life we have been pushing for a rewrite of America’s labor laws. The National Labor Relations Act was signed by FDR in 1935. Nearly 100 years and every change since—from Taft-Hartley to last week’s Supreme Court ruling in Cedar Point—has been an attack on working people. Under Democratic and Republican presidents. Through both Democratic and Republican Congresses. And where has that led? Wages held down for decades as profits skyrocket. Runaway inequality. Inequality of income, opportunity...and most of all, power. Our democracy is hanging on by a thread—as private equity billionaires fund legal attacks on voting rights and inspire actual terrorist attacks on our Capitol. This must change. It must change now. America must build a future based on democracy— political democracy and democracy at work. We must make big, structural change that empowers working people—all working people. And the leaders in this meeting...all of us...are uniquely positioned to do it. Together. We believe the single best agent for change is the PRO Act. We must pass the PRO Act so that the 60 million workers who want to join a union right now can do so freely and fairly. We also recognize that the majority of working people are women and people of color. And when working people organize, the power of our unity eclipses the differences between us. That's why passing the PRO Act is not just about rising wages, it’s about racial justice and gender justice, immigrant rights and LGBTQ rights. Collective action and collective power would lift more families and communities to a better life, in urban centers and Appalachia, in Big Tech and the American South. Like the New Deal and the civil rights movement, the PRO Act will have a multiplying effect, boosting efforts to fight climate change, win racial justice and fix our democracy. But here is the bottom line, and I hope it can shape our discussion today. The labor movement alone cannot pass the PRO Act. We need a broader coalition to win. One as big and broad as the hopes and aspirations of the American people. And we cannot win a progressive agenda for America’s future, from the For the People Act to the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, without a stronger labor movement. Either we pass this agenda together, or we watch it sink alone. Simply put, you can’t change America if you don’t change our labor laws. And trust me, if we fail to deliver the progress our country is demanding today, the racists and authoritarians are waiting in the wings.  So what we do in these next weeks...and months...and over the next year...may well set the table for decades. And I am absolutely convinced that we have the public’s support, the president’s support and the resources and brainpower in each of our organizations...to come together and shock the world. Listen, there is no shortage of skeptics. I’m hearing it from friends and allies alike, and I’m sure you are too. The path is too small. Time is too short. What about the filibuster?Let me say this as clearly as I can. We passed the PRO Act in the House. The president has urged Congress to send it to his desk. And for that we need 50 votes in the Senate. 50 real votes. 50 senators that are not playing procedural games or looking to run out the clock. That’s all we need. It’s written right there in the Constitution plain as day—the Senate runs by a simple majority.  This is not the time for excuses or equivocation. We need consistent, relentless forward motion. We need action. And we need to do it together. Though on any given day we will have targets—this fight has to be a national fight—in every state. Though we have a calendar, we must commit to fighting until we win. And we must be ready to lift up those who join us and hold those who stand in our way accountable—no matter which political party they come from. Already we have made great progress together. The workers’ rights movement and the  progressive movement have fought for the PRO Act, and together we have won victories no one expected. We moved Senator Angus King, with a little help from the bravery of nurses in Maine, and we moved Joe Manchin. And we have made sure that our remaining Senate targets—Mark Kelly and Lisa Murkowski and Krysten Sinema and Mark Warner are hearing from the people who elected them that it is time to pass the PRO Act.This meeting is a recognition of the breadth and strength of our coalition. The AFL-CIO didn’t have to ask you to engage on the PRO Act. You were already there. Making calls and holding rallies and raising this issue with our elected leaders. We’re grateful. We’re inspired. And we’re asking you to coordinate with us so we can sing even louder and reach even further. We have a big week of action coming up July 17-25. You’ll hear a lot more about that today. Join us. Push us. We have rallies and a toolkit and everything you need to make this week a success. Let’s create a force that sends shockwaves throughout the political world. And make no mistake, we’re ready to coordinate with you on the fights of our time to protect the vote, win equality for all and build a more perfect union. Together, the heart and soul of America—the racial justice movement, the gender justice movement, the LGBTQ movement, the immigrant rights movement, faith leaders, young people, retirees, activists, community service partners, union members, everyone—can find strength and a voice through all of us together. The stakes are as high as they could be. Our economic future. Our democracy. The PRO Act is the path to a brighter day, a stronger country and a future worthy of our children. So let’s stand together and take that path and seize that day. Thank you.

115,Trumka: No System Can Endure If It Doesn't Provide For the Workers Who Make It Run,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-no-system-can-endure-if-it-doesnt-provide-workers-who-make-it-run,6-23-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks as prepared at the 26th Annual Stanford Directors’ College. You may watch President Trumka’s speech here.Hello, everyone. And thank you, Michael Callahan, for that kind introduction. It’s wonderful to be back with my friends at Stanford, although I’m sorry we can’t be together in person today. As working people continue to help our country turn the corner on this pandemic, I hope this is one of the last times we’ll be forced to gather virtually.I’ve thought a lot about the lessons of this disruptive year. I’m sure you have, too. Among them is the reality that a disease that conspired to keep us apart has in fact rekindled our faith in what is possible when we’re together. When we’re united. When we share the same physical space, of course—but also when we all push in the same direction.The technology that has transformed our world has long demonstrated the value of being interconnected. What the pandemic has taught us is that we’re also interdependent.When a contagion circulates in the air between us, we have no choice but to rely on one another. My safety is your safety. Your health is my health. My decisions and your decisions determine the destinies of so many others.What the pandemic proved to us is something this country has always preached: divided, we fall. Without unity, we cannot survive. And if we turn our backs on one another, there is a tangible price to pay.This unprecedented experience also showed, in the starkest terms, how fragile we are. I came up in the mines of southwestern Pennsylvania. I can’t claim to know much about coding, but I know that one bug can bring a whole program to a halt, just as one virus can shut down an entire respiratory system and one infected person can put an entire household at risk—or even an entire community.Today, my friends, I want to remind you that our economy works the very same way.We all want the enterprise to be healthy. But that’s only true when all facets of the economy are healthy. We all want our economy to be stable and prosperous. But that’s only true when the people who make it work feel that stability and share in the prosperity.Right now, our economy is sick because working people are being silenced. When our economy is sick, our democracy is weak. My friends, absolutely nothing threatens our democracy more than inequality. It’s not even close. And when inequality widens, capitalism itself goes on life support.That’s the reality at this moment in America. That is the crisis we must solve together—you, your boards, and us: the workers who make it all run.When I say “inequality,” I mean three things: Inequality of wealth and wages. Inequality of opportunity. And inequality of power. We won’t solve the inequality of wealth and wages and the inequality of opportunity unless we confront the inequality of power.Simply put, workers are too weak. Corporations are too powerful.The longer this imbalance continues, the heavier the burden becomes. And if we keep doing the same thing and pretending massive social power gaps are inevitable or harmless, our economic and political systems will come crashing down on us. Believe me: the scourge of inequality threatens the very survival of our democratic institutions.The facts are the facts. If you look at a CEO’s pay stub and compare it to one from 1978, today’s would be 940 times bigger. But what about a worker’s paycheck? Did it go up in similar fashion?We all know that it hasn’t. In those 40-plus years, workers’ wages have gone up just 12 percent. Twelve. 940 to 12.The gap between what CEOs make and what workers make used to be 30 to 1. Today it’s almost 300 to 1.In 2020, a year of undeniable hardship, CEO pay jumped nearly 16 percent. The average worker’s compensation didn’t even rise by two percent. That was for those of us lucky enough to keep our jobs. And in the last decade, the average director on an S&P 500 board received a raise of more than $30,000 every year. The rank-and-file worker’s pay didn’t even rise by a thousand bucks.That’s what I mean when I say the imbalance is getting bigger. The weight is getting heavier. And the day when everything implodes is getting closer. And at the current trajectory, there’s simply no other way this story ends besides widespread disaster.That’s why America’s labor movement is committed to bringing economic justice to every workplace. We’re committed to guaranteeing social justice for every working person, regardless of whether we carry a union card. It’s why we’re fighting so hard to strengthen collective bargaining power. No system can endure if it doesn’t provide for the workers who make it run.I know that is not lost in this room. Organizations like the Business Roundtable have started to shift their sights from shareholder value to stakeholder value. They recognize that this is part of what it means to be a fiduciary. They recognize that inequality is not in their interest—or any American’s interest. This epidemic of inequality has strained the social fabric of the nation. It has fueled anger and frustration and a rising tide of despair, addiction and depression—even death. It has even tempted some Americans to support nativist politics and excuse white supremacism. If we were sitting together today, we would be in the shadow of Silicon Valley. Technology in particular has a responsibility to steer us toward a better day. Tech isn’t inherently good or bad. Deployed well, it drives unprecedented productivity. Used poorly, it can drive people out of their jobs and into the streets. It can bring us together or it can tear us apart—and we have to design it as a force for good.Low-wage employers like Uber and Amazon deliver people and goods in fast and convenient ways, but they should not be allowed to hide behind new technology or legal tricks as an excuse for treating people poorly.We have to recognize the reality that tech can contribute to extreme economic uncertainty and anxiety when workers aren’t involved in shaping it. When there isn’t input from diverse perspectives.When too many are cut off from the profits we generate.Earlier this year, the AFL-CIO launched our Technology Institute. It will serve as the labor movement’s hub on these issues. By growing labor’s technological expertise and capacity, we will expand our power and relevance. And demand our seat at the table. But the challenge is not just fairly deploying 21st-century tech. It’s updating early-20th-century labor laws. Workers can’t organize in the present under the rules of the past.   Let’s learn the lesson of the past year: We’re all in this together. The people who stock our groceries and protect our grid. The coder and the construction worker.We all have a stake in America. And we all do better when we all do better. That’s solidarity. And it happens to be great economics. When we raise the bar, the entire economy improves. Wages go up. Consumers have more money to spend. Businesses thrive. And employers feel the competitive pressure to pay more. If we facilitate wage-driven growth, as we did after the New Deal, our economy will be more stable. And it will be much more enduring than financial bubbles or other sugar highs.A workforce that is well-compensated, that has high productivity, that has dignity—that comes with having a voice and collective bargaining power. That’s how we compete in the world. And we believe that’s not too much to ask.This is the basis for the PRO Act, which can help move our economy back to stable condition from the low-wage, race-to-the-bottom model sending our country deeper into crisis.It has passed the House—twice in fact. Along with voting rights and police reform and a 21st-century infrastructure package, the PRO Act is stuck in the Senate. But if it gets to the Oval Office, President Biden will sign it. And I believe we all share an interest in getting it there, because we all share an interest in a healthy economy and democracy.The PRO Act is about empowering working people with freedom. The freedom to band together on the job. The freedom to have a voice at work. The freedom to form a union without the anti-union propaganda, the blatant intimidation and the fear of retaliation.If you tend crops in North Carolina or clean hotel rooms in New York City, if you’re an engineer in Silicon Valley or an autoworker in Mississippi, you should have the right to bargain with your coworkers for a better life. And employers must abide by that right. Some might say this is radical. I say it is fundamental. And regardless of where we stand, it’s already the policy of the United States.Sixty million people would join a union today if given the chance. An MIT study confirmed that before the pandemic, and I’d wager that number is even higher today. And more than 60 percent of Americans support the PRO Act.But outdated laws and anti-union attacks are robbing too many workers of the union difference. The PRO Act will finally allow workers the freedom to form a union freely and fairly. It will finally make sure that workers can reach a first contract quickly after a union is recognized. And it will finally end “right to work”—a relic of the Jim Crow era designed to divide us and make us poorer.We talk about the future of work and the future of democracy. What I want you to remember is this: these are one and the same. They're not different challenges. They, like all of us, are interconnected.The reason I’m fighting so hard for the PRO Act—and why I think you should be, too—is it’s where everything we care about comes together:Our democracy—which relies on the voice of the people. In a union, everyone gets a vote, and each vote counts the same.Our economy—which thrives on fairness and opportunity but crumbles under the weight of inequality.Our safety—which should never be at risk in our workplaces. The PRO Act is also about our dignity—as workers, as coworkers, as human beings.No handouts. Nothing unearned. Just leveling the playing field and rewarding hard work the way it should be rewarded. It’s about working people getting our end of the bargain without having to beg for what we’ve rightfully earned.Look, maybe you and I don’t see eye-to-eye on every point of labor policy. But I know you believe no one should be forced to work in unsafe conditions that result in injury—or worse. I know you believe there is inherent dignity in hard work. I know you believe in the promise of capitalism. I sure as hell know you believe in the worth of our democracy.And so, my friends, a system as unequal and unstable as ours is a house of cards on the brink of collapse.If you don’t agree with every suggestion or solution that the American labor movement is offering to eliminate inequality or level the playing field, I respectfully ask: what’s your solution? In the face of COVID-19, many corporations declared “we are all in this together.” Now it is time to show us.  How do we honestly make workers’ lives better? How can we look back on January 6 as a grave warning sign never to be repeated again—rather than the beginning of the end?What will we do in this moment? Like so many of you, I was—and still am—a student of law. Despite being a very proud graduate of Penn State and Villanova Law School, I do know the motto of Stanford: ""The wind of freedom blows.""Stanford students are summoned to use their knowledge to serve others, spread prosperity and safeguard democracy.You and I should also answer that righteous call together. We need to.When the wind of freedom blows, we extinguish the flames of fear and hate.When the wind of freedom blows, our political, economic and social systems don’t just work for some—they work for working people.Because when the wind of freedom blows, working people don’t just get by—we get ahead.That should not be controversial or political.  We all want to lift up our communities. We all want our families to feel secure. We can do that together. Indeed, together is the only way we can do it.Inequality is a choice. So is doing better. Let’s choose the better path that empowers working people with real freedom in our workplaces. Thank you.

116,Trumka: Being Jersey Strong Means Being Union Strong,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-being-jersey-strong-means-being-union-strong,6-15-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the New Jersey State AFL-CIO COPE/Legislative Endorsement Conference:Good morning. Brother Charlie Wowkanech, thank you for that kind introduction and for your leadership. And thank you to my sister Laurel Brennan for your incredible work.It is an honor to join you for your 2021 Legislative and COPE Endorsement Conference.And next time, mark my words: we are going back to Atlantic City!Before I continue, I want to thank: Governor Phil Murphy; Senate President Steve Sweeney; General Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin; and all the elected officials joining working people today.  Let me also acknowledge our brother and the individual the New Jersey State AFL-CIO is recognizing today: Amalgamated Transit Union International President John Costa. Brother John Costa does not need much of an introduction. We know him. He came up through ATU Local 819 in Newark. He is tough as nails at the negotiating table. And he has fought like hell for his members during this pandemic. Finally, I want to thank each of you. Every working person attending this conference is Jersey Strong!You don’t need me to tell you that. You already know it. But let this proud Pennsylvanian indulge you this morning.When I think of Jersey Strong, I think of the firefighters who rushed to the Twin Towers on 9/11 and who stayed at Ground Zero for weeks. Not because they had to be there, but because they felt a sense of duty to be there.I think of the resilience of the building trades workers who rolled up their sleeves after Hurricane Sandy and rebuilt the Garden State.This year, when I think of Jersey Strong, I think of the working people who held New Jersey together. The grocery store clerk stocking the shelves. The teacher adapting to remote teaching so our children could keep learning. The transit worker transporting fellow front-line workers to and from the job. I also think of the working people who were—or still are—out of work through no fault of their own.And they were top of mind for this state federation, too. Under the leadership of Brother Charlie, the New Jersey State AFL-CIO launched Operation Feed Atlantic City.The pandemic crushed A-C, but it could not stop working people from feeding our brothers and sisters and neighbors who struggled to put food on the table.In the words of Bruce Springsteen, “We take care of our own!”But brothers and sisters, we will also extend a hand to our friends in need.That’s why, for over a year, you volunteered in the blistering heat and the bitter cold. The rain, sleet and snow did not scare you away.When the cars lined up, you showed up! You handed out meals and showed the strength of solidarity! While the work continues, I understand the last food distribution is on Thursday. And I know, to date, over 40,000 meal kits and four million pounds of food have been distributed.Brothers and sisters, think about that. You did more than put food on the table. You gave working families hope! And you are bringing Atlantic City back to life!You see, labor doesn’t walk away. We stand strong. We fight.And we deserve leaders who will stand beside and fight alongside us!On Capitol Hill, the entire New Jersey congressional delegation voted for the PRO Act.Both senators and all 12 representatives. 12 Democrats and two Republicans. Being Jersey Strong means being union strong!And the PRO Act is a generational opportunity to build back better with unions.It’s time to finally level the playing field. Anyone who wants to carry a union card should be able to do so freely and fairly.I believe it’s not a matter of if we pass the PRO Act, but a matter of when. And when we do, we’re going to have quite a party in New Jersey.You know better than anyone that our power is not limited to one political party or level of government.Four years ago, the New Jersey State AFL-CIO replaced one governor who closed bridges with a new governor who believes in building bridges. After two terms of Chris Christie talking a big game and pretending to be pro-worker, New Jersey elected Phil Murphy—a governor who is pro-worker.Governor Murphy is the real deal. I know firsthand.Last year, Governor Murphy asked me to serve on New Jersey’s Restart and Recovery Commission.And I have to admit, I was a bit surprised.Here was the lineup. A professor at Princeton and the president of Rutgers.The CEO of a Fortune 100 and the founder of a startup.A former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve chairman and a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.I noticed something pretty quickly: everyone else is from or has some connection to New Jersey. I’m from Nemacolin, Pennsylvania! My Penn State Nittany Lions have beaten the Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team in the last 14 consecutive matchups.But the governor did not hold my Pennsylvania roots against me. In fact, he’s asked for my input at every meeting. And that’s telling. On calls filled with corporate executives and academics, he wanted to know what working people needed. And that’s because your governor gets New Jersey is only as strong as the working people who power it and build it and serve it.During the pandemic, he’s signed legislation honoring the service and sacrifice of front-line workers. At first, if a front-line worker in New Jersey came down with COVID-19, they had to prove they contracted the virus at work to access workers' compensation. Governor Murphy changed that.He knows nobody could have imagined the kind of danger and extreme challenges this pandemic would present essential workers with. Instead of paying lip service by telling workers we are heroes, Governor Murphy treats workers like heroes.That’s the kind of governor every working person deserves.Governor Murphy is easily one of the most pro-worker governors in America. And when all the votes are counted on November 7, workers are going to elect Governor Murphy to a second term.And let’s send the governor back to Trenton with reinforcements—including the nearly 50-rank-and file union members on the ballot this November! Your labor candidate program is a crown jewel. In just two decades, the New Jersey State AFL-CIO has elected 1,138 labor candidates.As I already mentioned, I came up in the coal mines of southwestern Pennsylvania.When you’ve been laboring alongside your fellow workers two miles underground…When you’ve been watching each other’s backs and fighting alongside them for your rights on the job…You truly trust and understand each other in a very fundamental way.You don’t just champion or support labor. You are labor!One thing I’ve learned over my tenure in the labor movement is there’s no one I’d rather have at the decision-making table or in the halls of power than a union member!Brothers and sisters, we have a chance to bring this state back and build it back better than it ever was.So let’s knock on doors and make calls. Let’s talk to our friends and neighbors. Let’s turn out the vote like never before. We won’t back down. We won’t shut up. We won’t run and hide. Jersey strong! Union proud!Thank you. And God bless you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
117,Trumka Hails Tai's Worker-Centered Trade Appoach,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-hails-tais-worker-centered-trade-appoach,6-10-2021,"The AFL-CIO hosted a union member town hall at its Washington, D.C., headquarters, featuring AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka (UMWA) and U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai. President Trumka delivered the following opening remarks:Hello, everyone. I’m Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO.On behalf of our 56 affiliated unions and 12.5 million members, I want to welcome you to the House of Labor. And I want to thank Ambassador Katherine Tai.This is a historic first for working people.Ambassador Tai is the first USTR to come to the House of Labor to discuss the importance of workers’ rights in trade policy.For years, working people have pleaded for a seat at the table during trade negotiations. Time and time again, the door was slammed shut in our face. And that happened during Republican and Democratic administrations.Today marks the start of a new era. Ambassador Tai values workers’ voices and believes in workers’ rights. The labor movement knows that trade is a vital part of a modern global economy. But the global economy must work for working people.  Our choice is not whether trade and economic globalization are inherently “good” or “bad.”The choice is this: Are U.S. trade policies ensuring workers share in the prosperity we generate? Or, are we making the same decisions that have created a race to the bottom?
 
Over the past 40 years, Republican and Democratic administrations have pushed a harmful neo-liberal “free trade” agenda.An agenda based on the myth that lowering tariffs and expanding trade would somehow make us all better off. It did not. Workers became poorer and weaker. On the global level, the World Trade Organization promoted trade rules that catered to—and were created by—big corporations. Meanwhile, workers’ rights and environmental protection were cast aside and branded as “non-trade” issues. The result has been a race to the bottom on wages and standards, environmental destruction, and runaway inequality. And make no mistake: skyrocketing inequality is the reason for the growing backlash to globalization. Inequality breeds distrust, division and the destabilization of democratic institutions. These are consequences of failed trade policies. We can’t repeat the mistakes of our past.It’s time for a new model that promotes good jobs, high wages and sustainable economic growth.A model that protects our environment and respects human dignity around the world.The labor movement is ready to work with Ambassador Tai and the Biden-Harris administration.Because to guarantee shared prosperity, working people must be a part of the process. We must be included in the initial conversations. We must be in the room to shape the final decisions.I believe this is possible. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is proof it’s possible.When the Trump administration delivered an unenforceable, business-as-usual agreement, the labor movement mobilized our allies in Congress.We made it clear: make significant changes with us or count on us to block this.  Katherine Tai did more than work with us, she was by our side in the political trenches.She gave us her word that USMCA would not be NAFTA 2.0.Together, we rewrote USMCA and got a deal done.  So when Ambassador Tai says USTR is committed to advancing a “worker-centered” trade policy, I know she means it.  
 
Without getting ahead of the ambassador, I believe there are three essential elements of any worker-centered policy.First, the process matters. Agreements should be negotiated through a transparent, democratic and inclusive process.Trade agreements are too important and too impactful to be negotiated in secret by a select few. Every proposal should be subject to rigorous review by the public. Congress must debate every deal and not be allowed to simply “fast-track” it. Second, our trade deals must contain clear, strong, and enforceable labor standards. That means upholding fundamental labor rights agreed upon by businesses, workers and governments at the International Labor Organization. Major issues of non-compliance must be addressed upfront before any agreement is signed. Third, our trade deals should be crafted carefully to prevent the offshoring of more good-paying, union jobs. For decades, our jobs have been shipped over oceans and sent over the border. We think it’s time for the era of offshoring to be over.  We can do that by adopting strong rules of origin to encourage domestic production and employment. And we must address currency manipulation, China’s massive industrial subsidies, and other forms of trade cheating that played such a big role in hollowing out our industrial base. The benefits of trade should flow to the countries who assume the obligations of the agreement, not third parties who seek to gain market access without playing by the rules. Of course, the labor movement has more recommendations. But as I said earlier, today is just the beginning.During her confirmation, Ambassador Tai said something I never heard from a United States Trade Representative. The ambassador said the U.S. has: “overlooked the effect of our trade policies on workers, who are human beings, living in a community trying to survive and thrive.”That core belief is needed to achieve a worker-centered trade policy.It’s my privilege to introduce Ambassador Katherine Tai.

118,Worker Empowerment and Infrastructure Investment Go Hand in Hand,https://aflcio.org/speeches/worker-empowerment-and-infrastructure-investment-go-hand-hand,6-7-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the 2021 Amalgamated Transit Union’s Legislative Conference, which was held virtually:Brothers and sisters, hello! Thank you, Brother John Costa, for your kind words of introduction. I am proud to work closely with you, International Secretary-Treasurer Ken Kirk, International Executive Vice President Javier Perez, Jr. and the entire Amalgamated Transit Union.It’s an honor to address your legislative conference.And there is no better lawmaker to join us today—and no better champion for working people in Washington—than Senator Sherrod Brown.Senator Brown is more than a supporter of the labor movement. He’s a stalwart. Like all of us, Senator Brown believes in the dignity of work.Dignity comes from family-sustaining wages and good benefits. Dignity comes from the promise of a good retirement with a well-funded and well-earned pension after years of late nights and early mornings.Dignity comes from the guarantee of safe workplaces. Safety on the job must always be a priority. All of us should return home to our families when our shift ends.   For too many workers, that promise is too often denied.  In America, not a day goes by without an act of gun violence. Gun violence has a ripple effect. The pain tears through communities. It inflicts lifelong trauma in survivors. It creates an unfillable void in the hearts of loved ones.And yet gun violence keeps happening here because America keeps doing nothing to stop it.  Something is wrong. We need to get to the root of the problem. Because far too often, gun violence is a workplace issue.  We cannot grow numb. We need to find out why our neighbors keep resorting to their very worst impulses. What are the causes and conditions of these massacres? While each mass shooting is its own individual tragedy, there are common threads. Isolation. Untreated mental health and addiction. Hate. Fear. Economic hopelessness. And yes, easy access to deadly weapons.Friday was National Gun Violence Awareness Day. For ATU members—for every member of the labor movement—this year’s memorial hit home and it hit us hard.All of us have been to a union meeting. A union meeting is a place of solidarity and a cradle of democracy. On May 26, at a San Jose rail yard, a union meeting became the site of a mass shooting.We lost nine members of ATU Local 265—nine of our brothers. We mourn their loss. We pray for their families. And we pledge to do better for those of us blessed to be alive today. Our obligation is to honor our fallen brothers as fathers and sons. Brothers and friends. Humans with hopes and dreams.Let’s never forget: Our federation is family. And families must come together on dark days and in times of grief.Grief is something working people have felt a lot of over this past year.Today, I’m also thinking of Tiran Billups.Tiran began his career as a bus operator in 1996 with New Jersey Transit.He proudly served as the president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 819.When this pandemic hit, he fought to protect front-line workers—his brothers and sisters—with PPE and safety measures.COVID-19 took Tiran from his family—and this family—in June. Along with Tiran, at least 140 ATU members have lost their lives to COVID-19.While the pandemic started more than a year ago, ATU members never stopped.    We honor the dead by fighting for the living. Those were the instructions Mother Jones gave us. And ATU will answer her call because ATU members always—always—deliver for the communities we serve.Brothers and sisters, it’s time to get America back on track. It’s time to build back better with unions. The PRO Act is how we do it.The PRO Act is more than legislation. It is a generational opportunity. An opportunity for the labor movement and those who hope to put a union card in their pocket. Sixty million people would join a union today if given the chance. An MIT study confirmed that.Well, the PRO Act would allow workers to form a union freely and fairly. It would make sure that workers can reach a first contract quickly after our union is recognized. It would end the practice of hiring permanent replacements to punish striking workers. It would hold big corporations responsible—and it’s about damn time we do. And it would finally end right to work—a relic of the Jim Crow era designed to divide us and make us poorer.Last week, the New Hampshire AFL-CIO beat back another attempt to ram through right to work in the Granite State. For more than six months, labor leaders and union members across New Hampshire rallied together and contacted our representatives about this anti-worker legislation.While this victory is a testament to the strength and will of working people, we should not have to fear that big corporations and anti-worker politicians are going to pass right to work in New Hampshire—or anywhere. When we pass the PRO Act, we will end right to work and put it in the ash heap of history where it belongs.
 
But there is another takeaway from this victory. The governor of New Hampshire is a Republican. Both the New Hampshire Senate and House of Representatives are controlled by Republicans. Working people prevailed because banding together to form a union is not red or blue—it’s red, white and blue. A recent Morning Consult poll found a staggering 73 percent of voters—including 59 percent of Republicans—support the right to collectively bargain. The PRO Act will strengthen and expand the right to collectively bargain. That’s why, in a rare bipartisan vote, the House passed the PRO Act again in March.  And that’s why President Biden—the president we elected—included the PRO Act in the American Jobs Plan.Let’s not forget President Eisenhower—a Republican who put union members to work building America’s Interstate Highway System—said, “Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.” President Biden realizes today what President Eisenhower did over a half-century ago: Worker empowerment and infrastructure investment go hand in hand.But for decades, other nations have invested in infrastructure while America talked about it. Our lawmakers picked tax cuts for millionaires over transit systems for the masses. The cost of that negligence and incompetence is more than money. It’s deteriorating transit systems and crumbling infrastructure. It’s runaway inequality. It’s America falling behind and leaving working people behind.That’s why ATU never stopped pushing for robust investment at the federal and state levels. ATU members are ready to start operating and maintaining new trains and buses and subways.The days of delays and indifference must end.With $85 billion alone for transportation, the American Jobs Plan recognizes the needed investment in our communities—both big and small. The PRO Act and the American Jobs Plan are essential pieces of legislation for essential workers. Both meet the mark for ATU members and America’s workers.For the past 15 months, ATU members have been on the front lines of this public health crisis. Your service has allowed fellow essential workers to get to hospitals, grocery stores, warehouses and other workplaces. And you took us home when our workday was over. You continue to bear the brunt of this unprecedented pandemic economically and emotionally.ATU members are undoubtedly saving lives and helping us in our decades-long fight to win a Workers First Agenda. We are on the cusp of rebuilding transit systems and returning power to the hands of workers.Our opponents will do everything to stop us. They are ruthless and well-funded.   
 
I say, bring it on. We've taken your best shot for decades. ATU members are still standing tall today. Solidarity is the strongest thing in this world. And ATU is ready to get America moving again.We’re the ones who wake America up every single day, and we work through the night. We drive the buses. We operate the subways and streetcars. We get Americans to the places we need to go. We’ll stand strong. We’ll never run and hide. We’re the American labor movement, and we will not be denied!Thank you. God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",AFL
119, Trumka: The Survival of Democracy Anywhere Depends on Working People To Defend It Everywhere,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-survival-democracy-anywhere-depends-working-people-defend-it-everywhere,4-20-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks to the Trade Union Confederation of the Americas:Toni Moore, thank you for that introduction. And more importantly, thank you for all you do to empower working people in Barbados—and around the world.It is wonderful to be joined today by former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.The AFL-CIO is a proud partner of not only the Brazilian labor movement, but of Lula—a proven pro-worker champion.Just over a year ago, before the pandemic, I was able to visit Lula in Brazil—still unjustly imprisoned—and present him with the AFL-CIO’s George Meany-Lane Kirkland Human Rights Award.I promised our continuing solidarity in the fight for justice and democracy—in Brazil and around the world. That promise we made in 2019 is a promise we will keep today. The AFL-CIO will continue to stand with President Lula in his fight for justice.I’m also grateful to be joined by President Alberto Fernandez.We know the previous government made working people weaker in Argentina. And that was one of the many challenges his administration inherited.Under his leadership, workers are changing the trajectory in Argentina. They are forging a new era—one where power is shared and labor is valued.President Alberto Fernandez, your recent creation of the Economic and Social Committee—an important space for social dialogue—means workers will once again have a seat at the table.And when working people have the power to shape policies and our collective future, we ensure our political, economic and social systems actually work for working people.Working people demand and deserve that power. In Argentina. In Brazil. In the United States. Everywhere.The survival of democracy anywhere depends on working people to defend it everywhere.The truth is democracy and the labor movement are one and the same.Without an empowered labor movement, too many people will be unable to sustain a living and provide for our families.To the surprise of nobody, inequality has soared to extreme levels.Inequality of wealth and wages. Inequality of opportunity. And inequality of power.You can’t solve inequality of wealth and wages or inequality of opportunity until you solve inequality of power.Simply put, global corporations are too powerful and working people across the globe are too weak.And as long as that imbalance is allowed to continue, we won’t be able to solve inequality.And inequality is a threat to democracy.It breeds pain and fear and distrust. And it undermines the democratic systems we rely on.Make no mistake about it: Extreme levels of inequality result in growing distrust in our democratic institutions.If democracy is synonymous with inequality, the foundation of our global community is in danger of implosion.So the labor movement is going to do our part. To reverse decades of austerity and greed and outsized corporate power.Think about it. Our unions run like our countries—by the will of the people.All members get to vote, and each vote counts the same.The greatest risk to any democracy occurs when working people are beaten down and left out. Ignored and unseen. Rendered voiceless and powerless.That happens too often and in too many places.Here are the facts.Today, the world is three times richer than it was just twenty years ago.And despite that, hundreds of millions of working families have been left out of the gains their work created.Seventy percent of people have no access to universal social protection.And 84 percent of people say that the minimum wage is not enough to live.In 2020 alone, working people lost the equivalent of 255 million jobs worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Despite what some may think, not everyone can see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.Look at the global vaccine rollout. In the United States, the president set an ambitious goal in January to get 100 million vaccines in 100 million arms in just 100 days. Since then, he’s doubled that goal to 200 million vaccines—and the U.S. is well on its way to meeting it.But America’s labor movement knows that the vaccine rollout is not just a national effort—it’s a global effort. We have reached out to the Biden administration. And we have urged them to send vaccines to Brazil and other countries in the region that so desperately need them.Vaccine equity is solidarity. We will not begin to heal from this pandemic until all working people are safe from COVID-19.We are living through a period of great crisis. A pandemic and an economic free fall. Climate change and human rights violations. And underlying it all is the brutal pain of a global economic system that does not serve the vast majority of people. It’s a ticking time bomb. And bad policy decisions continue to light the fuse.Look at what has happened over the last few years around the world.Look at how many attempts there have been to overrule democratic elections or override the will of the people.In Brazil, by persecuting Lula—and stopping him from running in an election he surely would have won.In Bolivia, by forcing a duly-elected president to leave the country because of a nullified election.In the United States in January, when a mob—motivated by white supremacy and nazism—stormed our Capitol in an attempt to deny President Biden the White House.Whether they knew it or not, the former president used that mob to try to create the kind of country he wanted. A country where only the rich and powerful have a voice. That is what happens without democracy. Working people go from being citizens to subjects.Fortunately, the U.S. labor movement organized not only to win that election. We organized to defend what we won.And that fight for democracy is still one we are waging today.A cornerstone of our Workers First Agenda—the agenda we are counting on President Biden and the U.S. government to deliver—is democracy reform.Since January, right-wing lawmakers have introduced legislation that would make it harder to vote in 43 of our 50 states.You see, democracy is still under siege in the United States.It’s not a coincidence that the opponents of democracy are also anti-worker politicians. The politicians who have spent decades dividing and weakening working people. Tearing us apart by race. Weakening social protection programs. And fighting our unions with everything they have.My message to them is simple: Your time is up.Democracy must exist at the ballot box, but also in the workplace.In the United States and countries around the world, working people are clamoring for:We need a set of policies that work for every worker—from the migrant domestic worker to the street vendor, the teacher to the construction worker.We need to create a new economy that works for us.That’s why workers are banding together and engaging in collective action.But it should not be so hard to form a union.We should not experience threats and intimidation and even violence for exercising our rights as trade unionists. It is still far too dangerous to be a trade unionist in Colombia, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and so many of our countries.In the U.S., our labor laws have failed to protect workers. That’s why labor law reform is so important. But the Protecting the Right to Organize Act—or the PRO Act, for short—is more than labor law reform legislation. It’s an economic stimulus. It’s civil rights legislation. It’s democracy reform.The survival of our democracy—and every democracy— hinges on working people to defend it.We always have. We always will.Give us back our power and we’ll pull our countries back from the brink.We’ll begin to reverse the damage to our diminished democracies.And we’ll do that by creating a new social contract.A social contract that:The prescription to our common problem is finally fixing the systems that have failed working people—whether they’re political, economic or social.From Brazil to Belarus, Hong Kong to Myanmar, the fight for democracy and the need for worker solidarity is global.That’s why the labor movement has never been more important than we are today. And we have never been more ready for what we must do.In the coming years, when we look back these days, let us be able to say we rebuilt our democracies.That we banded together to collectively bargain for working people today—and for generations to come.That we returned power to the hands of the workers.They may not remember our names. But trust me, they will never forget what we did together.Thank you. And may God bless you.Toni Moore, back to you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
120,Trumka to Earth Week Forum: Addressing Climate Change Will Confront Deep-Rooted Equity,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-earth-week-forum-addressing-climate-change-will-confront-deep-rooted-equity,4-19-2021,"Good afternoon and Happy Earth Week. Thank you, Brother Cecil (Roberts).Ernie, I want you to know how much I appreciate working together through the Labor Energy Partnership. Secretary (Jennifer) Granholm, on behalf of the 12.5 million working people in the 56 unions of the AFL-CIO, thank you for being here. And to you both, I want to say how much it helps working families when the Secretary of Energy is pro-worker. Look, we’re facing the threat of climate change.The challenge of keeping and creating good union-jobs. The urgent need to secure workers rights and dignity. Rights and dignity. For every worker. All colors, creeds, faiths, genders, orientations, abilities and experiences. That’s the full scope of diversity that makes us America.Because, as we address the climate crisis, we will confront deep-rooted inequity. Systems built on stolen land and labor. Structures from the Jim Crow South. 40 years of trickle down economics, neglected infrastructure, and offshoring.The inequality of income, opportunity and power that have left communities all across the U.S. behind.But with President Biden, I’m confident those days are over. Because that’s what he promised. I’ve known him for 40 years. He’s a man of his word.His climate goals are ambitious. But this is America. We do big things. And the best...and we would argue the only...path forward runs through the labor movement.That’s why the president’s executive order on climate calls for “well-paying union jobs.”Secretary Granholm, we appreciate your leadership. We hear you calling for millions of good-paying union jobs to build the equitable, clean energy future we need and deserve. We appreciate that you want to invest in us.I happen to be a third generation Pennsylvania coal miner. Those jobs built this country. And my union, the United Mine Workers of America, made coal mining a middle-class job. They didn’t start out that way. Across our economy, industry by industry, that’s how unions built the American Dream.And as we transition to clean energy, we're not going to give up an inch or sacrifice a dollar for false promises of “retraining.” We’re not going to walk away from places like Greene County, Pennsylvania.We will fight climate change with everything we have. But we simply won’t allow this transition to be done on our backs. Working families will tune you out if it’s going to cost us the ability to feed a family...or our toehold in the middle class. We need job creation upfront, not “to be determined.” There should be an investment and jobs plan in every community that lost or will lose coal jobs...every community where plants will no longer make transmissions...every community that suffers from environmental damage. Each person and every place matters.We know the Biden administration gets it.That’s the hope and promise of building back better.  For racial justice. Gender equity. With labor unions. If our rights, dignity and power are at the center of the clean energy transition... We will create widespread opportunities, lift each other up—out of poverty, away from the margins, into a new era of possibilities.  The single greatest key is passing the PRO Act—which guarantees a free and fair path to a union. See, coal companies didn’t gift us living wages and safety protections. They nickeled and dimed us. Told us coal dust was good for our lungs.My union won job safety and quality through collective bargaining, not corporate benevolence. We had to fight for every right. Every protection. Every raise. Workers paid in blood spilled by Coal and Iron police.We can’t answer the climate crisis if we have to fight those battles again. Let’s learn from the past. Calling it a green or a clean job doesn’t make it a good job, doesn’t equal family-supporting wages, doesn’t mean retirement security. Workers in renewable energy sectors need a free and fair path to organize, to make those jobs good jobs. NOW. Equitable clean energy means universal labor rights and local opportunities. For every person and every place in America.That’s why this discussion today is so important. We’re grateful to have you, Secretary Granholm. Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
121,Trumka: Now Is the Time To Get Immigration and Labor Law Reform Done,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-now-time-get-immigration-and-labor-law-reform-done,4-15-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks to the House Labor Caucus:Good afternoon, everyone. I want to thank this caucus for your leadership on labor issues.Since we last spoke, the American Rescue Plan became the law of the land. The ARP is going to save lives and livelihoods.But you didn't stop there. You know the importance of following relief with recovery. That’s why you formed this caucus. To build back better with unions! And that means passing the PRO Act. You don’t need me to tell you what the PRO Act will do or how many lives it will improve.This is arguably the most important piece of legislation in my lifetime. On behalf of the 12.5 millions members the AFL-CIO represents, and the 60 million Americans who want a union card in their pocket, I want to thank you.Thank you for making the PRO Act a priority and passing it in the House with a strong bipartisan majority. Mark my words: we’re going to fight like hell to pass it in the Senate and send the PRO Act to President Biden’s desk!  And we know this caucus is going to help us.We are thrilled the PRO Act is part of President Biden’s American Jobs Plan. It makes perfect sense. Infrastructure investment, good jobs, worker voice and a cleaner planet is something we should all agree on.And so is an immigration system that honors workers, families and our nation’s history. In particular, let me acknowledge Representative Sánchez for her introduction of the U.S. Citizenship Act and for asking me to come here today to speak about immigration as a workers’ issue.  That’s not hard for me to do because I come from a family of immigrants.When immigrants from my parents’ and grandparents’ generation arrived in America, we were the last hired and first fired.The people who did the hardest and most dangerous work.The people whose pay was shorted, because we didn’t know the language and were afraid to complain.Despite all that, we persevered. We helped build this country, and we helped build my union, the United Mine Workers. That is the history of my family, and it is the story of towns—large and small—across America. It is also the story of our labor movement. It’s dangerous when we forget our history and allow powerful forces to sow fear and division—repeating a dangerous refrain that immigrants are taking our jobs. The people who peddle that fear are wrong—and we know they are wrong.Immigrants neither moved our plants overseas nor took away our pensions.Immigrants neither slashed our health care nor hacked away at our right to organize. All too often, anti-worker politicians try to make immigrants their scapegoats, instead of taking real steps to defend workers—like supporting the PRO Act. We see right through that. All working people are the victims of an economic system designed to keep wages low so corporate profits can grow ever higher.Just as we did a century ago, we will end this race to the bottom by linking arms and standing up together to demand something better. Here are some grave facts. One out of every 20 people in our country showed up to work today without legal rights or protections. Most of them have lived here for more than a decade. That is an outrage and it is contributing to the erosion of wages and standards for all working families. It’s time to say enough is enough.America’s labor movement is fiercely committed to transforming the lives of working people through bold, structural changes that remove all barriers to the right to organize. We have got to finally get meaningful immigration and labor law reforms over the finish line, and we cannot do that without this caucus.By creating a broad and swift path to citizenship for all those who have been failed by our unjust system, the U.S. Citizenship Act will help spur a just recovery. And it will ensure that we are able to fight together for living wages and safe workplaces. This bill provides a strong pro-worker and pro-democracy framework for change. Although it does not include all the reforms our system needs, we are heartened to see that it includes many key protections for which workers have long fought.You see, the right way to use immigration policy to raise wages and standards is by expanding rights and protections for all workers. And that’s what this bill does.  But we are familiar with the compromises that accompany immigration debates in Congress, so we implore Congress not to repeat the mistakes of the past.This is a moment for bold action. Now is not the time to allow amendments that criminalize our immigrant communities, escalate the immigration enforcement regime or expand programs that treat workers as commodities in our global economy.Let’s not get confused about this: our guest worker programs—as they’re currently structured—are about creating an on-demand, disposable workforce that is entirely disenfranchised.  Is that the future of work you want in your districts? Because it sure isn’t the vision we have for how to empower working people.  In fact, it’s designed to do quite the opposite—keep us divided and poor.  Any time we have tiered rights for workers, we all lose.  So we don’t want to see any expansion of programs that fuel occupational segregation, particularly in this economy where women, immigrants and workers of color have suffered disproportionately.  What we should do now is reform abusive programs like H-2B and H-1B visas. Representatives Castro and Pascrell have good bills to do that. And we hope you’ll support their legislation.Now, I know there is a lot of concern about moving forward on a constructive immigration agenda, especially with the dynamics at the border.So let me say this: a bunch of frightened families and children showing up and asking for our help because they aren’t safe in their countries is not a threat to our security.We have an administration that is working hard to find real solutions to these complex issues. It won’t be easy because we all know what a mess they inherited, but shame on us if we let the fear mongers keep us from doing what is right.  They want us to be afraid of children and families. The truth is we should be afraid for them. 
 
Now is the time to step up and restore our humanitarian systems because that is what strong nations do.We urge the Biden administration to send a clear signal on that front. We hope they announce ambitious refugee resettlement numbers and TPS designations for Haiti, Cameroon and Mauritania, and all the Central American countries devastated by the recent hurricanes.That is the leadership we need right now. And I hope all of you will join me in calling on them to extend those protections, and in supporting them when they do.  Border flows are cyclical and we cannot let them paralyze us.We look forward to working with Congress to ensure that the U.S. Citizenship Act—and its principles—move forward in ways that align with our Workers First Agenda. We know we’ve got an uphill battle on this and every other issue we care about in the Senate.So we urge you to explore every possible vehicle to put working people on a long overdue path to citizenship.We’re all gearing up right now to pass an infrastructure package—and the bigger the better.  Building back better and passing the PRO Act is our top priority.We all know that getting people back to work is going to be critical to the midterm elections, so you have got to deliver.But let me be clear, we want the jobs created by this investment to be well-paying jobs—jobs where workers have a voice and earn living wages. And we want all the working people in our country to be able to access these jobs, rather than continuing to be misclassified and forced into the informal economy.  So make no mistake: these issues are all connected.We rely on workers to keep our workplaces safe and fair.Not just to do the work, but to enforce the labor laws that protect us all—like the COVID-19 workplace standard we were told was coming and hope is issued any day.  So the labor movement will continue to mobilize to ensure that all workers have the status to assert our rights on the job and in the community. Because we know that the best way to strengthen our democracy and our economy is by empowering workers—and that should not have any exclusions. Successive waves of immigrants and refugees like my family—and many of yours—have always helped to build, serve, and feed our nation.  Today is no different.  These pathways are a source of strength and vitality for our country, our workforce and our unions.  Immigration is key to creating economic growth but we need that to be sure that growth is inclusive and lifts all boats, which is why we need real rights for everyone who lives and works here.  Now is the time to get immigration and labor law reform done, so let’s work together to do it.Thank you.

122,Trumka on Amazon: We're Not Going Anywhere,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-amazon-were-not-going-anywhere,4-9-2021,"Following the results of the union election at Amazon in Bessemer, Alabama, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks as prepared on a virtual press conference hosted by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU).Thank you, Brother Stuart Appelbaum, for your earnest leadership and your unwavering commitment to worker empowerment.To the RWDSU members and heroic Amazon workers who made this election possible: I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.Look, this is not the outcome any of us hoped for. And trust me, I know it hurts.But make no mistake, you won the moment you decided to take on Amazon. Our fight for justice and dignity and safety endures. To put it more plainly, we’re not going anywhere.When the most powerful company in the world started to bully you and intimidate you, it would have been easy to cave or compromise.But you choose to double down, not back down!We stand behind each and every one of you. And America is on your side.More than three-fourths of Americans supported this organizing drive. You changed minds about unions and captured the heart of a nation.We won't know the names of every one of the heroes who organized in Bessemer. But we don't need to know their names to know they made history.And this righteous fight will continue to fuel a labor renaissance in America. Whether Jeff Bezos likes it or not, this organizing drive will open the floodgates to more collective action. Mark my words.Working people in Bessemer understand something Amazon never will: This union election was about reclaiming our rightful share of power and shaping the future for generations to come.Not just for Amazon workers in Bessemer, but all working people across America.There is a surging movement for workplace democracy that is reaching every corner of the country.It’s reverberating far beyond a small town in Alabama.It's being felt by coffee shop workers in Illinois and Wisconsin, nurses at a major hospital in Maine and too many places to name right now.It's clear: There is a groundswell of union organizing.And working people want in.We’re done with the brutality of being underpaid and overworked.The indignity of being treated by management as disposable when they call us essential.The constant fear of being fired or feeling unsafe in our workplaces.Instead, workers want—and deserve—the rights and respect that come with a union card.Our cause is to ensure that everyone who wants a union card in their pocket can get one.That's a right of workers in America—the right to collectively bargain freely and fairly without interference or intimidation.It shouldn’t be this hard to form a union.Amazon’s behavior was outrageous, but it was not new. Their attacks are only the latest reminder that our rights have been steadily eroded by big businesses and union-busting politicians.Fortunately, we can change this. We have to.The right to form a union was enshrined into law under FDR. But today, it must be restored by this generation of leaders.That’s why we need the PRO Act.Working people should not have to walk the gauntlet to form a union.And when we make the PRO Act the law of the land, we won’t have to.The Senate needs to step up and level the playing field.It’s past time to return power to workers.To regrow union density so we can quell inequality.The policy of the United States is to encourage collective bargaining. So we need our lawmakers to start acting like it is.This is a moment when the potential for pro-worker change is limitless.Let us harness the power of what happened in Bessemer to manifest a new era of workplace freedom. A new wave of worker prosperity. And a new spirit of solidarity.Thank you. And may God bless you.

123,"Trumka: The American Rescue Plan Is Relief for Working People, Not Wall Street",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-american-rescue-plan-relief-working-people-not-wall-street-0,3-25-2021,"In an event on Facebook Live, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler had a conversation with five working people about the importance of the American Rescue Plan. President Trumka delivered the following opening remarks as prepared:Good evening. I’m Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. And I want to thank you for tuning in.We’re one year into this pandemic. And we’re still driving the buses and running the trains. We’re stocking the shelves and lifting the loads. We’re teaching the classes and caring for the sick.We build America and defend it. We do America’s work.We’ve held America together. Even as we’ve gotten sick on the job and lost our jobs. Even as we’ve lost loved ones—family members, union brothers and sisters and neighbors. Even as anti-worker politicians called us essential, but treated us like we’re disposable.On Election Day, working people rose up. We rejected inaction and incompetence. And we voted for a Workers First Agenda. The hallmark of that is the PRO Act.The PRO Act is bipartisan legislation that will finally—finally—allow workers to form a union freely and fairly.President Joe Biden asked Congress to send it to his desk. The House passed it with Democratic and Republican votes. The PRO Act’s fate will be decided in the Senate.For fifty years, we’ve been waiting for labor law reform. But it’s more than that.It’s civil rights legislation. It's an economic stimulus. It’s our litmus test. We can—and we will—make the PRO Act the law of the land.We know that’s well within our power because we mobilized for dire COVID-19 relief last year.We marched on Capitol Hill. Car-caravaned through our communities. Assembled peacefully outside our lawmakers’ offices.Two weeks ago, the pro-worker officials we elected passed the American Rescue Plan. And our good friend President Joe Biden signed it.Make no mistake: the American Rescue Plan is union made.The American Rescue Plan is relief for working people, not another bailout for big banks on Wall Street. And we did not accept crumbs off the end of the table this time.Look what’s in there.Payroll protection to keep us on the job and survival checks to put money in 85 percent of people’s pockets.Support for our states, cities and towns—so we can preserve critical public services and honor the heroes who provide them.Resources we need to ensure that kids and educators are safe in the classroom.Relief for multiemployer pensions. That is vital for retirees who have been living in fear that their retirement benefits—benefits earned after a lifetime of hard work—will be gutted.And it includes a 100 percent COBRA subsidy. No working person should have to choose between putting food on the table or paying for health care in a pandemic.To borrow a quote from Joe Biden: this is a big deal. And unions made it happen.The American Rescue Plan is going to cut child poverty in half. Studies show U.S. GDP will expand by 3.8 percent this year because of it.But look, here’s the truth: no fact or figure can capture the significance of the American Rescue plan.But working people can, and working people have to.Tonight, workers will tell our stories. Share our dreams. And discuss what the American Rescue Plan means to us.And with that, I want to introduce my co-host for this evening: AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler.

124,Shuler: The American Rescue Plan Delivers,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-american-rescue-plan-delivers,3-25-2021,"In an event on Facebook Live, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler had a conversation with five working people about the importance of the American Rescue Plan. Secretary-Treasurer Shuler delivered the following closing remarks as prepared:MaryAnne, Miren, Tom, Norma and Tevita: We appreciate you so much. Thank you for sharing your experiences with us. And thank you for the work you do.Through the worst public health crisis in a century, through the worst economy since the Great Depression—with no leadership from the last administration—working people stepped up.We elected the most pro-worker administration since FDR. And we worked closely with Speaker Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Schumer and pro-labor stalwarts to deliver a rescue plan that's going to help all of us.With economic impact payments, tens of billions to facilitate vaccination.And child care tax credits, funding for schools and states and anti-poverty programs.The labor movement organized and mobilized on pension relief for decades to make sure, as we always say, that promises made are promises kept. The American Rescue Plan finally delivers.That’s America’s Rescue Plan. What’s next is America’s Recovery Plan.And the foundation is the Protecting the Right to Organize Act—PRO Act for short.We need it to remove barriers to organizing, so we can turn low-wage jobs into good, union careers.We need it to restore our rights to stand together with co-workers and negotiate better pay, safety and more.The PRO Act would empower the 60 million people who say they want to join a union to do so without fear of retaliation or getting fired.You see, this isn’t just about union members. This bill will help workers from every sector, in every state, including essential frontline workers living on poverty wages.As it is, more than half of workers in the U.S. are threatened with job loss if they vote for workplace representation.One in five are fired.And yet, despite all this, in Bessemer, Alabama thousands of workers at the Amazon warehouse are voting to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. Right now.We stand with them in solidarity.But it just shouldn’t take an act of heroism to join a union. No one should have to risk their job to stand together with their co-workers.So everyone watching, do me a favor? Call your senators. Tell them to pass the PRO Act. And let’s keep calling until they do.Thank you.

125,Trumka: The PRO Act Is Our Next Frontier,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-pro-act-our-next-frontier,3-9-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a bipartisan press conference of congressional, labor and civil rights leaders in advance of House passage of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act: Good morning, everyone.

Together, we will make the PRO Act the law of the land.All of us agree that a union card is the single best tool working people have in the fight to win a fair share of the value we create every day.The right to freely and fairly organize is a patriotic belief, not a partisan one. Union members vote for both political parties and we live in red and blue states. Unionism transcends ideology, and it transcends any one issue.It strengthens civil rights. It makes us safer on the job. It creates fairer workplaces. It builds a stronger economy.In an era of extreme polarization, nearly two-thirds of Americans approve of labor unions. Seriously, think about how hard it is to find something more than 50 percent—let alone 65 percent—that the country agrees on.It’s clear: labor unifies America. So it’s not surprising that nearly half of non-unionized workers say they would vote to join a union today if given the chance. That's 60 million people knocking at our doors. The PRO Act would welcome them in.It would make sure that workers can form a union if they want to, free from employer interference and coercion.The very scare tactics being deployed by Amazon managers in Alabama today.The type of behavior Joe Biden called out in his historic video.The PRO Act would end the worst practices of employers, like hiring permanent replacements to punish striking workers. Like forcing workers to sit through union-bashing sessions. Like firing workers who have the courage to speak up.And the PRO would do something else: it would finally ban right to work once and for all. Right to work is nothing more than a racist relic of the Jim Crow era designed to divide us. And we plan to put it in the ash heap of history.But none of this will be easy.For decades, labor law reform has been neglected as the National Labor Relations Act has been weakened. Anti-worker politicians and big businesses have made it harder to exercise the right to collectively bargain.And for decades—too many legislators elected by union members with union might—have failed to pass a single bill to stop the bleeding.That ends now. The days of defense are over.This coalition—of worker and civil rights, of Republicans and Democrats, of union members from sea to shining sea—is ready to go on offense.Our opponents know it. And we see them panicking.In President Biden, we have a champion who—more than any of his recent predecessors—understands that “labor” isn’t just another constituency group that exists only during campaign cycles.And his rhetoric on the campaign trail has carried into the Oval Office.This is a president who jumps at the chance to tell a roomful of CEOs that he’s a union guy. Last Sunday, he released the most pro-union statement of any president since FDR. And just yesterday, he chose to double down, issuing a statement of administration policy in support of the PRO Act.To borrow a slightly-tweaked quote from Joe Biden: This is a big freakin’ deal.It's time to Build Back Better with Unions.The PRO Act is our next frontier. And our next fight is in the United States Senate. Not just for the PRO Act. But for infrastructure. For democracy reform. And civil rights. The PRO Act is the bill that makes everything else possible.Of course, there will be no shortage of skeptics who say passage of the PRO Act is impossible.But we will not let anyone define our capacity or diminish our collective power.We’ve been patient long enough. No more excuses. No more reasons why we can’t do it.The PRO Act is our litmus test. If progress is delayed or denied yet again, the suffering of the past year will only get worse.But if our leaders step up to the plate and deliver generational change—the change we voted for—we will emerge from this crisis stronger than before.Over the past year, America has witnessed the resilience and courage of working people. The nurse. The grocery clerk. The firefighter. The people who are holding this country together, healing it and ready to rebuild it. A union protects your safety and dignity on the job. Every working person deserves the protections that come with a union card.Pass the PRO Act and more Americans will carry that power in their pocket every day.God bless you. And God bless America’s working people.

126,Shuler at International Women's Day Event: Our Work Is Essential,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-international-womens-day-event-our-work-essential,3-8-2021,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks on International Women's Day:On behalf of America’s labor unions: Happy International Women’s Day! We have 6.5 million women—and growing—so that makes the AFL-CIO the largest organization of working women in the entire country.I’m Liz Shuler, Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO, Treasurer of the Solidarity Center Board of Trustees and proud member of the Coalition of Labor Union Women.Through so many challenges, the tremendous loss of life and jobs through this pandemic, threats to our communities and democracy, women are carrying the heaviest burdens.We are withstanding so much. But we are not alone and we are not remaining silent. We’re protesting and organizing and mobilizing, online and in the streets.We’re raising our voices and we, women of every age and color and faith we are claiming our power through our unions. That’s not a new story. But it is one of the most important stories in the world and we need to keep telling it. Because it’s about our strength and it is about our collective power.In the U.S., long before women had the right to vote, women organized unions. Many were young, immigrants, poor and discriminated against.They worked in garment factory sweatshops, in textile mills. They were exploited by industry. And they felt powerless on their own.But they innovated, they realized they could fight back against abuse, they could win safer workplaces and better wages if they stood together.Over twenty-thousand joined the “bread and roses” strike in 1912. As we now know, it’s called that for the two struggles—for their rights as workers and their right to dignity, as women.In the U.S., “Women’s Day” began on the one year anniversary of this act of courage. But what we’re talking about is so much bigger than one moment or one place.Generation after generation, over centuries, women have organized, fought for better lives and freedom.To end slavery and colonialism, occupation and the patriarchy. In Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.International Women’s Day is a recognition of ALL of us. And today we recognize that our work is essential and that our progress continues.In the U.S., we elected Vice President Kamala Harris— the first Black woman, the first Indian woman—to serve in the second highest office.And guess, what? Having her in that position means that she is including women at the table: union women! Because she knows, when women join unions, lead unions, the labor movement expands, and the power of all workers grows.And when we lead democracy movements, like in Myanmar and Hong Kong and Belarus, when we organize for good jobs and collective bargaining in supply chains, as in Mexico and Bangladesh, when we reclaim our humanity from the platform companies and gig jobs that treat us like robots and demand essential pay for essential work on the frontlines of the pandemic, when women stand up, to confront gender based violence and harassment, we change rules and laws, we shape economies, we change the world.My point is, women belong. In government. In unions. At every table of leadership and power.I am humbled and grateful to serve the labor movement in the United States, to stand on a foundation built by the brave women who came before. Some fought and lost, some went to jail and even died—that tradition is shared by all the women speaking today, from Ghana, Palestine, Ukraine, Colombia and the U.S.Listen to the stories of these inspiring women. And keep telling the story of our power.Let’s join today to honor each other, our dignity and our voice.Happy International Women’s Day! Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
127,Trumka to American Legion: Nothing Provides Financial Stability Like a Union Card,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-american-legion-nothing-provides-financial-stability-union-card,3-1-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the American Legion's Washington Conference:Good morning. Thank you, Chairman Daniel Seehafer. And thank you to National Commander James Oxford for the privilege of joining the American Legion today. Next year, let’s do it in person.You know me as a union guy. I also come from an American Legion family. My dad, who served in the Pacific during World War II, was a commander of American Legion post 816. An uncle of mine was a state commander and two other uncles also were Legionnaires. My mom, who spent countless days delivering food and books to Veterans across Pennsylvania, was a state officer with the Cootiettes of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.So my family is a military family. And I have deep respect for the American Legion’s history and great confidence in its future.In the shadow of World War I, this proud organization was chartered in the spirit of “mutual helpfulness.” Is there a better way to describe what America’s servicemembers, Veterans, and their families represent? And for that matter, there’s no better way to define what the labor movement is all about.When you look at both groups of Americans—Veterans and union members—mutual helpfulness is what you see. You’ll see it in the way we always have each other’s back. The way we lift each other up. The ways in which we foster and feel the strongest senses of sisterhood and bonds of brotherhood.And of course, there is a tremendous amount of overlap between Veterans and union members. I’ve asked Veterans what being in a union means to them. They tell me that it gives them a chance to lead, just like the military did. They say it is a source of dignity, just like their service was. They say it means the duty and the opportunity to continue fighting for what’s right.Mutual helpfulness runs on trust. It doesn’t work any other way. We have to trust one another. But we also have to trust that our hard work will pay off and our rights will be recognized. When trust breaks down, everything breaks down.Democracy is just another word for mutual helpfulness at the national scale. And democracy runs on trust, too. No one believes in democracy more than you. No one has advanced it more than you and those you served with.Today, absolutely nothing threatens our democracy more than inequality. It’s not even close.When I say “inequality,” I mean three things: Inequality of income. Inequality of opportunity. And inequality of power. The rich and corporations are too powerful. Working people are too weak. The longer this imbalance continues, the heavier a burden inequality becomes—until it comes crashing down. Believe me: the longer we wait to do something about these three scourges of inequality, the longer the odds that capitalism can survive.The facts are the facts. If you look at a CEO’s pay stub and compare it to one from 1978, today’s would be 940 times bigger. But what about a worker’s paycheck? Did it go up in similar fashion?We all know that it hasn’t. In those 40-plus years, workers’ compensation has gone up just 12 percent. Twelve—940 to 12.The gap between what CEOs make and what workers make used to be 30 to 1. Today it’s almost 300 to 1.That’s what I mean when I say the imbalance is getting bigger. The weight is getting heavier. And the day when everything implodes is getting closer. This system is fundamentally broken. At the current trajectory, there’s simply no other way this story ends.That’s why we’re committed to bringing economic justice to every workplace and guaranteeing social justice for every working person, regardless of whether they carry a union card. It’s why we’re fighting so hard to strengthen worker bargaining power, so more workers can fight for ourselves. Because no system can endure if it doesn’t provide for the workers who make it work.You don’t need me to tell you that when something is broken, Veterans fix it. That’s because when something is broken, Veterans feel it.Inequality and financial instability are among the most sinister enemies Veterans face when they take off the uniform. When our heroes return to civilian life, we know too many struggle to find a sense of purpose and feel a sense of respect. Inequality is at the root of indignity.For example, most Veterans take home less than $50,000 a year. In fact, 31 percent of working Veterans earn less than $31,000. They likely don’t have health insurance or a retirement plan. That’s not enough to get ahead. Heck, that’s not even enough to get by. The American Dream you fought for is about doing better than the generation before you. But you can’t build a livable future without a living wage.You can draw a straight line from this inequality—this instability—to the other silent enemy far too many Veterans face on the home front: suicide. Veterans are taking their lives in ones and twos and threes every day. It is the tragedy of all tragedies, and there are many causes.It’s not a new crisis. In fact, it was one of the earliest fights the Legion fought a century ago.But in the richest country in the world, in the 21st century, your dignity, your job, your income, your savings—these should never lead someone to take their own life.Brothers and sisters, there is nothing that restores your dignity, nothing that pulls you back into the workforce, nothing that amplifies your voice in the workplace, nothing that provides financial stability like a union card. It is a key to a world-class apprenticeship. To good wages. To a sound retirement. To solidarity. To equality.The way forward is clear: one of the best escape routes from this triple threat of inequality is to get a union card in the hands of as many workers as possible. And that can’t happen unless we get them in the hands of as many Veterans as possible.Unions were there to welcome home Veterans throughout the 20th century. And we’ve kept our arms open just as wide for the 9/11 generation.Unions created tens of thousands of jobs through programs like Veterans in Piping, the Utility Worker Military Assistance Program, and the Union Veterans Council.The building trades Veterans recruitment program, called Helmets to Hardhats, has placed more than 36,000 Veterans and spent more than a billion dollars to train the next generation of highly skilled union craft workers.And unions across the country have fought hard to make sure Veterans’ pay doesn’t get cut and working standards don’t get dangerously watered down.As we connect Veterans to union jobs through these programs and many others, there are two policies that demand our attention today.The first is called Buy American, and it does exactly what it says it does. It revitalizes American manufacturing by making sure our tax dollars advance production here at home. Too many corporations—including many that wrap themselves in the flag—take unfair advantage of loopholes that let them favor foreign-made products.The American Legion supports the Buy American resolution. So does the AFL-CIO. We support closing loopholes, creating jobs, and giving America’s workers a level playing field. Because we know that when they have that fair chance, they out-compete anyone in the world.When we Buy American, we honor Veterans and workers.There’s one other policy change that also needs our focus and our support—and if you remember nothing else from this morning, I want you to remember this.It’s called the PRO Act, and it will give Veterans and all workers the freedom to band together, to collectively have a say in our own economic future and in our working conditions.Sixty million people would join a union today if given the chance. An MIT study confirmed that, but I’d wager that number is even higher because of this pandemic. And Veterans are more likely to join a union than non-veterans.But outdated laws and anti-union attacks are stealing that choice from too many Veterans. That’s what the PRO Act will reverse. It will finally allow workers the freedom to form a union freely and fairly. It will finally make sure that workers can reach a first contract quickly after a union is recognized.As much as the PRO Act is about empowering workers, it’s also about holding corporations responsible. Why? Because it’s about damn time.It will stop corporations from punishing striking workers by hiring permanent replacements. And it will, once and for all, ban right to work—a racist relic of the Jim Crow era designed to keep Black and white workers apart that has no place in America. Segregation did not work in the military. And it does not work in the workplace.Joe Clarkson served in Iraq and Kosovo. Now he lives in Missouri, serves his community in a local government job, and is a member of AFGE Local 96. Joe said that he often thinks of what’s written on his union hall’s wall: “United we bargain, divided we beg.”In other words: mutual helpfulness.The PRO Act is where everything we care about comes together:Our democracy—which relies on the voice of the people, each of whom gets a vote, each vote counting the same.Our economy—which thrives on fairness and opportunity but crumbles under the weight of inequality.Our safety—which should never be at risk in the workplace. Can you imagine coming home from a warzone and worrying about how likely you are to get hurt on the factory floor?It’s also about our dignity—as workers, as coworkers, as human beings.That’s some of what’s written in the PRO Act. But I’ll give you an even simpler way to say it: if someone asks you what’s in this bill, just tell them: what’s inside the PRO Act is the American Dream. It is one of the most patriotic pieces of legislation you’ll ever read.What’s more patriotic than making sure Veterans and military families can get a job and health care and a livable wage? Provide for their families? Have security in retirement?No handouts. Nothing unearned. Just rewarding hard work the way it should be rewarded. Getting our end of the bargain—and not having to beg for what we’ve earned.Brothers and sisters, tell the elected leaders who represent you: “Veterans are not props. Don’t just take a picture with us. Take a stand for us.”Don’t just thank Veterans for their service. Serve them right back. Give them a job with pension benefits and good health care, including mental health care.I mentioned earlier that the American Legion came to life at the end of World War I. As it was said at the time, we fought that war “to make the world safe for democracy.”The labor movement was founded on a similar, simple idea: to make the workplace safe for working people. To make the economy work for those who make it run.America’s unions have done that. But just like the fight for democracy, our work is never done. We have been called to do it again and again. And we must answer the call—we must further the fight for working people—and we are needed right now.We need to fight against inequality of income.Against inequality of opportunity.Against inequality of power.And with the same determination, we must fight against racial inequality and all brands of discrimination.Even though every service member serves on equal footing, regardless of background, race, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity, that’s not always true when they return. Veterans of color, female veterans, and LGBTQ+ veterans face unique challenges.Collective bargaining helps here, too. It increases protections for everyone in areas where our laws are still falling short.In fact, a union contract is the single best tool we have to close racial and gender wage gaps in the Veteran workforce, and to ensure dignity and due process for workers.In recent months, we’ve been called to make America safe for democracy. I never thought I’d have to say those words.We must understand—and we must never underestimate—the role that racism plays in attacks on the legitimacy of our government and its leaders.You all saw the insurrection at the Capitol less than two months ago. Confederate flags. Nazi symbols. Wolves of anti-Americanism wrapped in patriotic clothing.This inequality is our common enemy, too. It’s just like trust—if our ability to respect one another breaks down, nothing else works.The American Legion building and the AFL-CIO building are separated by a few footsteps. It’s a reminder that the American Legion and America’s labor movement are not only close in proximity, but also in a common mission—between union members and Veterans and those who can proudly say they’re both.What all of us have in common is our belief in fighting for what is right—and for our shared, unalienable rights.That solidarity is our strength. Like any platoon, like any brigade, like any band of brothers and sisters, when we’re stronger—when we’re mutually helpful—we can fight better on behalf of everyone else.When union membership is higher, worker power is greater.When worker voices are louder, inequality is weaker. And that’s good for every working person, whether they’re in a union or just hope to join one—whether they’re a Veteran or just grateful to know one.I count myself among the many who, every day, are grateful. Grateful for what you and your families did. Grateful for what you do. And grateful for what you will do next to bring us out of darkness and into the light of a better day.Thank you for your service. Thank you for your helpfulness. And thank you for the honor of being with you this morning. God bless you all.

128,Trumka: Collective Bargaining Is an Exercise of Freedom,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-collective-bargaining-exercise-freedom,2-20-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the 2021 AFGE Legislative and Grassroots Mobilization Conference, which was held virtually:Thank you, Brother Everett [Kelley]. I am grateful for your leadership and friendship.And I am proud to stand alongside every AFGE member. You are proud public servants—and proud union members—who have fought back against some of the most despicable political attacks in our nation’s history.For four long years, AFGE was the former president's punching bag. He attacked your collective bargaining rights. His administration attacked your members’ due process. They attacked your very right to exist.But after each hit, you refused to be knocked down or knocked out. Because you understand that collective bargaining is an exercise of freedom. It's the law of the land.At last year's conference, I made you this promise: we’ll be here long after we send Donald Trump back to his gold-plated mansion. Brothers and sisters, one month ago today, Donald Trump took a one-way flight to Florida. And we're still standing. We're still serving America.AFGE members are strong, but you don't serve for fame or fortune. You serve because you believe our veterans deserve quality care from the VA. So our soldiers have the supplies they need. So seniors get the Social Security and Medicare they rely on.You do that because you took a sacred oath. During the darkest of days, you carried out your duty with dignity and honor—because you are patriots.And you know there is nothing more American than forming a union.President Biden believes that, too. It's why he proudly calls himself a ""union guy."" In one month, this president revoked three executive orders designed to eliminate collective bargaining, due process, and workplace representation rights for federal employees. Removed anti-worker members of the FSIP. Fired the union-busting general counsel of the NLRB. And reinstated that the policy of the United States government is to encourage—encourage—collective bargaining.These big wins happened because of you. But big challenges remain. This conference is meant to make your demands known to the people in power.With the pandemic still crushing the country we love, we demand COVID-19 relief. Health care. Pensions. Paid leave. State and local funding.It’s time to go big and bold. Compromise is not going to cut it.AFGE members are doing more than ever to serve our country. So we demand more from the people who run this country, including the right to freely and fairly form a union.Congress needs to make the PRO Act a priority, pass it and send it to President Biden.Unions must belong to everyone, everywhere, in every sector. Because when you mess with one of us, you will get all of us.Of course, skeptics will say it's impossible. But the past four years proved that labor can not only take a punch, but we will never stop demanding what’s rightfully ours: collective bargaining, a secure retirement, safe working conditions and fair wages.That's what we believe. That’s what we do. That's who we are.AFGE is devoted, powerful and tough as nails. You serve America in every way. And as one united labor movement, we are serving our neighbors and demanding better together.This is a new day. The sun is rising. Our solidarity is growing. And the best is yet to come.God bless you. God bless AFGE. God bless the American labor movement.

129,"Trumka: We Will Prove We Can Use Technology for Good, Not Greed ",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-we-will-prove-we-can-use-technology-good-not-greed,1-25-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks about the future of work and the labor movement at the Battle of Homestead Foundation's annual meeting: Good evening. Thank you, Rosemary Trump for that warm welcome. You, John Haer and this foundation are not only preserving the legacy of the 1892 Homestead Strike, but bringing together a diverse group of workers.My only regret is I'm not home in Pennsylvania. The fact we are still together tonight—still connected—is a sign of the times.Technology is connecting us at this very moment. It can be a force for good. But technology is also creating extreme economic uncertainty and anxiety.Technology has been exploited to exacerbate inequality. It’s a matter of who develops it and who has access.Are workers involved in shaping it? Is there input from diverse perspectives? Who profits? Who gets to use it? And how?Our concerns are real. And they are certainly not unfounded. As it is, the government socializes the risk of research and development. It privatizes the profits. It doesn’t, as a matter of policy, require good job creation and shared prosperity or union involvement in the development process. That is a choice. It’s a backwards approach. And our movement is committed to changing it.The Battle of Homestead was driven by radical technological change. It fundamentally altered the relationship between craft skill-based unionism and capitalist industrial organizations. We have to look at the Battle of Homestead as more than a consequential moment in our past. It is a guidepost for our future. The future of America's labor movement. And with it, future opportunities in America.More than 125 years after Homestead, working people are living through another industrial revolution—this one marked by technology and innovation that are changing everything.For at least four decades, and especially over these past four years, our unions have been attacked. Our rights weakened. Our voices suppressed.Meanwhile, technological breakthroughs are happening at a breakneck speed. The American science and engineering enterprise is investing billions. It’s happening in our workplaces and communities—from robotics to autonomous systems. And as we know all too well, the COVID-19 pandemic is only accelerating digital transformation.Technologies are being developed to replace working people during a time when inequality is soaring. Rapid transformation raises questions on the future of work—questions about jobs and profits. Training and re-skilling. Algorithm bias and data privacy. Democracy and power.Will we let the exploitation of technology foster greater economic injustice and income divide? Or will we demand that technology raises standards, grows wages, creates opportunity and improves lives? We must choose the latter.We must shape technological forces, not be decimated by them. America's labor movement will not wave the white flag and surrender to the worst impulses of Silicon Valley billionaires. We will not give in to the greed of the tech barrons who feed off of a perverse system of independent contractor abuses. We will take them on. We are in this fight for the future—our future.Just two weeks ago, the AFL-CIO launched the Technology Institute. It is a central recommendation of the AFL-CIO’s Commission on the Future of Work and Unions. The Technology Institute will serve as the labor movement’s hub on these important issues.It will help us test and incubate new ideas, solve issues created by technology and shape innovation—top to bottom. In our workplaces. In the collective bargaining process.In Pittsburgh where we’ll strengthen partnerships like the one we have with Carnegie Mellon or in Cambridge, Massachusetts with MIT, where research shows more than 60 million workers want a voice in the workplace. By growing labor’s expertise and capacity, our Tech Institute will put power behind workers’ aspirations.We will prove we can use technology for good, not greed. Reversing inequality. Breaking up the system that has Big Tech and corporate America exerting way too much power over how and why we innovate, with no consideration of workers’ needs. And create opportunities in a future that works for all working people. Whether we are in a union or hope to be.Make no mistake: we will not shape 21st century technology with 20th century labor laws. Right now, America's labor movement has a generational opportunity. It's called the PRO Act—the Protecting the Right to Organize. And it is at the top of the AFL-CIO's Workers First Agenda.The PRO Act would allow workers to form a union freely and fairly. It would make sure that workers can reach a first contract quickly after our union is recognized. It would end the practice of hiring permanent replacements to punish striking workers. It would hold corporations responsible who try to block workers from forming a union. It would finally ban so-called ""right to work"" laws—racist relics of the Jim Crow Era that belong in the trash bin of history.And it would ensure the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 has real teeth—so it can achieve its original purpose, which is clearly stated: To actively encourage collective bargaining. Not to hamstring. Not to even just tolerate unions. But to actively encourage collective bargaining. Nothing less.Yet in the more than 80 years since its passage, every amendment to the law—most egregiously the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act—has made it more difficult for workers to form unions. And anti-worker judges have tried to whittle away what was left of our rights from the bench.The PRO Act is how we win a new era where union desire drives union density. And it’s passage is not far-fetched. Last February, Speaker Pelosi and the House passed the PRO Act. Then it stalled in Mitch McConnell’s Senate. And it would have been vetoed by the former president.One year later, the prospects of passing the PRO Act are far different. We still have a pro-worker House and now we have a pro-worker Senate. And thanks in large part to the Keystone State, we have a president who proudly says he’s “labor from belt buckle to shoe sole.”This legislation will strengthen our unions, but also grow our movement. Workers are embracing collective action with a fervor I haven't seen since I was growing up in Nemacolin. Union density rose last year—even in the face of unemployment and economic pain and outright political incompetence. The popularity of unions is at 65 percent, one of the highest marks in a half-century.Every single day it becomes clearer that tech workers want a voice. Google and other Alphabet companies announced earlier this month they are forming the Alphabet Workers Union, in partnership with the Communications Workers of America Union.This follows union wins at Kickstarter and Glitch. In Bessemer, Alabama, 6,000 workers at Amazon will vote on forming a union of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, a part of the United Food and Commercial Workers.Just imagine the possibilities. When tech workers win a union, they have power. And when workers have more power, CEOs cannot make decisions about technology unilaterally.Tech and innovation are part of the next frontier of America's labor movement. There is enough room in the labor movement for the steelworker and the tech worker. Enough energy to harness technology and rebuild America with union labor and union steel.Unions are for everyone, in every field. That’s why the labor movement is working to organize Big Tech and fighting for a fair and equitable future of work—in every sector.This is what we do. This is what we know. This is who we are.For more than 100 years, America’s labor movement has built collective power for workers in various kinds of uncertain and vulnerable industries. We've turned bad jobs into good jobs. Our efforts transformed entire industries so generations of workers were able to sustain families as part of thriving communities.This is what unions do.We believe there is no basis for the pessimistic view that good jobs soon will be a thing of the past. Workers—all workers—in the future can enjoy the rights and protections of employees. Uber and Lyft. Boeing and GM. Teachers and first responders.Our movement is always the best bet for workers, and workers are our nation's greatest hope. Workers are marching and demanding a voice on the job and a say in the future.A better future can become a reality if we make the right choices now.  Let’s choose hope over fear. Let’s choose good over greed. Let’s choose worker-driven innovation over corporate-driven inequality. When we come together, when we dream together, when we work together, anything is possible.We can build a brighter tomorrow, a better America and a future of work that works for all of us.Thank you. God bless you. I am happy to take some questions.

130,Shuler to AFL-CIO Civil and Human Rights Conference: Black Women Have Been Carrying This Country,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-afl-cio-civil-and-human-rights-conference-black-women-have-been-carrying-country,1-16-2021,"Hello, everyone. It is an honor to be with you all to pay tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy and to celebrate the ongoing march, from protest to power.And this year, we have much to reflect: on the tremendous loss of life, of jobs, and threats to our communities, economy and democracy. But there is also much to celebrate: the incoming Administration, and Georgia and the U.S. Senate!But, I want to talk specifically about what is owed to Black women.Recognition is owed to Black women like Stacey Abrams and our own Georgia AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Yvonne Robinson for mobilizing stunning electoral wins in Georgia.Support is owed to Black women like Dr. Timnit Gebru who stood up to Google, spoke out about the harm algorithms can cause communities of color and inspired union organizing in Big Tech.Justice is owed to Black women like Breonna Taylor, who had her life in front of her until it was robbed from her—and everyone she loved.So much is owed to Black women because they’ve been carrying this country since before America was a country. While the U.S. was founded on principles like equality, it was built on the backs of enslaved people, by labor stolen from Black women and men.Systemic racism exists at every level of American society. It’s reinforced generation after generation, year after year.Last week, in an attempted coup of the U.S. Capitol, look who committed it, who enabled it, and who encouraged it. We saw white privilege and we saw white supremacy. And in an age of disinformation and divided realities, it’s important to speak the truth, to call it what it is.We need to have some difficult conversations. That’s how we make our democracy stand. As we often say, the labor movement is a counterforce to racism and sexism and hate. That’s why in 2020 despite the pandemic, the pain, the loss and the challenges, labor marched and organized for racial and economic justice; and caravanned in our cars for COVID relief; and mobilized record numbers of working people to vote.In 2020, women of color were again the most reliable voters for our pro-worker candidates. 144 women of color are now serving in Congress—the highest number ever. And Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and the first Southeast Asian woman, will serve in the second highest office in the country. She will be the first, but.—say it with me—SHE WON'T BE THE LAST. The labor movement will make sure of it. Because women of color belong in the House and Senate and the White House, in their union and at every table of leadership and power.We were able to elect a new era of pro-worker leadership at every level of the federal government—thanks especially to our constituency groups getting out the vote in Georgia. Now let this conference be a source of inspiration for our future leaders and activists.As we reflect on Dr. King’s legacy, and his powerful words that keep us fighting and organizing, we remember that he was in Memphis that fateful day to help rally the community around 1,300 AFSCME sanitation workers who had gone on strike. He said, “Our society must come to respect the sanitation worker. He is as significant as the physician, for if he doesn’t do his job, disease is rampant.”Because of the COVID pandemic, we know how true that is. And let’s add she and they to that statement. Because women, especially women of color are the front-line essential workers, in the low-wage jobs—care, retail, and of course health care and education, getting us all through this pandemic. What is owed to women of color is the full power and force of their participation and leadership. Let’s start the conversation for how we do that, right here, right now. Today, but also every day. And a year from now, I want us to be discussing our progress.It’s possible. We’re capable of it. Now, let’s get to work making the real change—in our labor movement, our economy and our world. Thank you.

131,Trumka at AFL-CIO Civil and Human Rights Conference: We Must Push Ourselves and Society Forward,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-afl-cio-civil-and-human-rights-conference-we-must-push-ourselves-and-society,1-15-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following welcoming remarks at the 2021 AFL-CIO Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Civil and Human Rights Conference: Thank you, Brother Tefere Gebre and Brother Fred Redmond.And thank you to everyone who is joining us this year. The legacy of Dr. King—from his words to his character—is in each of us. In our solidarity, our service, our spirit. And that’s why we know Dr. King’s legacy is still shaped by us—the ones who came after him.We have a moral responsibility to carry forward the torch he lit. Dr. King told us that. And he told us why.In 1968, two Memphis sanitation workers, Echol Cole and Robert Walker, were crushed to death by a malfunctioning truck. Workers were rightfully furious.They did their jobs with few protections. Their trucks were dilapidated. They earned wages so low many were on welfare. They had a mayor who refused to recognize their union. They had enough, and they went on strike.Fifty-three years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. went to Memphis to join them. He spoke to the sanitation workers on strike and those who joined them in solidarity. We know Dr. King told them that he had been to the mountaintop. That he had seen the promised land. And he reassured them that they would all get there, even if he was not there.But let us not forget why Dr. King was moved to go to Memphis—why he was motivated to join the striking sanitation workers.He told them about the Good Samaritan. A parable about a traveler on the road to Jericho who is beaten and left suffering alongside the road.Dr. King recalled how: “a priest and the Levite looked over that man on the ground and wondered if the robbers were still around. The first question (they) asked was, ‘If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me?’ But then the Good Samaritan came by, and he reversed the question: ‘If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?’”That’s why King went to Memphis. He was not motivated by his own self-interest. Rather, he was moved by the righteous call of working people demanding dignity and a union.That question the Good Samaritan posed—a question that guided Dr. King—must guide us, too.We are living through a time of crisis, division and hate. A pandemic has killed over 375,000 Americans. Millions have been denied health care and a paycheck. Black and Brown Americans have been disproportionately harmed. The cancer of racial injustice continues to spread through society.Look no further than the attack on the U.S. Capitol. When domestic terrorists carried out an act of insurrection—a modern-day coup—they were by-and-large allowed to walk away. They were told to go home. The president sang their praises. And we know why this happened: because they were white.We are suffering. Under the lash of economic injustice and white supremacy. Systemic racism and political malpractice. In our workplaces. In our communities. Across this country.We must not turn our heads. We must not become numb to pain—whether it is our pain or the pain of our neighbors. Because we all should feel it.All of us or none of us.The labor movement is ready to help. To address racism in America—in whatever form it may take. To stop the inequality of income, opportunity and power. To beat COVID-19 and keep everyone whole. To grow America’s labor movement. To carry forward the torch Dr. King handed us—not just on one weekend each year.But every day, in every corner of this country, that is our moral obligation. To make Dr. King’s dream is our future.Change is coming to America. I can feel it. In elections won. In a democracy saved. In a labor movement that is growing more popular and militant by the day.But we can’t settle down or slow our roll. We can’t find comfort in complacency or normalcy. We must push ourselves and push our society forward.We won’t be in the middle of the pack. We’ll be the tip of the spear. We’re the American labor movement and we will not be denied!God bless Dr. King. And God bless all of you.

132,"Trumka: When We Make PRO Act the Law, We Will Need to Make Millions of New Union Cards",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-when-we-make-pro-act-law-we-will-need-make-millions-new-union-cards,1-14-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka's keynote address at the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades’ (IUPAT) “The Fight for the PRO Act” Facebook Live town hall, which included labor movement leaders and members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Good evening! Brother Ken Rigmaiden, thank you for that very kind introduction. And I can’t thank you enough for bringing us together tonight in support of the PRO Act. You are a trade unionist to the core. And you, Brother George Galis, Brother Jimmy Williams and the entire Painters and Allied Trades team are doing absolutely incredible work to lift up your members and empower our communities.And you are doing it amid a pandemic and an economic crisis.Right now, as I speak, President-elect Biden is proposing a long overdue COVID-19 relief plan. A plan he wants Congress to act on immediately and send to him in the first days of his presidency.Honestly, there is a lot of good stuff in there. A lot of pieces that were in the HEROES Act.Enhanced unemployment insurance, which Mitch McConnell let expire over the summer despite our nation being on the brink of a depression.State and local aid, which Congressional Republicans refused to consider without a liability shield for the big businesses who line their pockets.A federal standard to protect workers from COVID-19, which Donald Trump threw in the trash when he became president.This is much-needed relief. Relief that will save more lives and more livelihoods—no doubt about it.But all of us know—and the president-elect knows—there is one piece of legislation that will not just grow the economy, but transform America. And that’s the PRO Act.The PRO Act is a total game-changer—a cornerstone of our Workers First Agenda.The PRO Act is what motivated us to make phone calls and canvass workplaces during the election cycle.The PRO Act is why we did everything in our power to hold a pro-worker House. Win a pro-worker White House. And sweep the Georgia runoffs so we could demote Mitch McConnell and get our agenda on the Senate floor.Brothers and sisters, we ran the table!Our work re-elected two proven champions who are with us tonight: Congressman Conor Lamb and Chairman Bobby Scott! Last year, they helped pass the PRO Act in the House. This year, we are going to get it to Joe Biden’s desk—come hell or high water!Working people elected Joe, a man who promises to be the strongest labor president in modern history. A true friend of working people who looked CEOs square in the eye and said unions are going to have more power! You should have seen their faces. All they could do was nod!And Joe is surrounding himself with people like Marty Walsh—a labor secretary from America’s labor movement. The first in nearly 50 years! And a building tradesman, I might add!Without IUPAT, none of that would have happened. We would not have this incredible opportunity before us tonight.Because today, nobody can say the PRO Act is just aspirational legislation. Or it’s a pipe dream. No! The PRO Act is in play!But it will not pass without a fight. Corporate America will oppose us. Most Republicans will start at no. And some Democrats will be looking for a way out.So we need to organize and mobilize in every state and every congressional district.This is a generational opportunity. An opportunity for the labor movement and those who hope to join a union. Sixty million people would join a union today if given the chance. An MIT study confirmed that. And I’d wager that number is even higher because of this pandemic.Well, the PRO Act would allow workers to form a union freely and fairly. It would make sure that workers can reach a first contract quickly after our union is recognized. It would end the practice of hiring permanent replacements to punish striking workers. It would hold corporations responsible, because it’s about damn time. And it would finally—finally—ban ""right to work"" once and for all.Right to work is one of the last vestiges of Jim Crow. It is time to put it in the garbage can of history.Right to work is the past. IUPAT is the future. Your union card provides a world-class apprenticeship, good wages and a dignified retirement.But it’s more than that. Union members know we are stronger together. If you mess with one of us, you mess with all of us. A union card is a sacred symbol of solidarity.When we make PRO Act the law, we will need to make millions of new union cards.That’s good for every working person, whether we’re in a union or whether we hope to join one. When union membership is higher, worker power is greater! Our voices are louder! Our wages are better!Between 1948 and 1973, hourly wages rose by more than 90 percent—90 percent! Look what happened over the next 40 years. From 1973 to 2013, productivity boomed by 74 percent! And at the same time, hourly wages rose by only nine percent!We know why. Union membership in America hasn’t kept up.And we also know why that happened. Policymakers on both sides failed us. At worst, they weakened the National Labor Relations Act and attacked collective bargaining rights. At best, they did little to reverse those amendments or failed to follow through on their promises.Our power diminished. Politicians, the wealthy and big businesses took that power—our power—and used it against us.To the shock of nobody, inequality skyrocketed. Inequality of income. Inequality of opportunity. And inequality of power. Right now, the rich and corporations are way too powerful. And working people are way too weak.It is time to change the power dynamics in America and the PRO Act is how we do it! It puts power back into our hands—the hands of working people.This is a monumental moment.You can tell because our opponents are panicking about the PRO Act. Their power is on the line. They’re going to go all out to stop us, divide us and break us. We won’t let them. Hell no!It’s going to us—all of IUPAT and all of America’s labor movement—to push the PRO Act forward and pressure our leaders to make it law.This time must be different!Pro-worker candidates won on Election Day. Now we need to win our Workers First Agenda. And keep the PRO Act at the top of the agenda, not on the backburner.So, get ready to mobilize and organize like never before.If you want to change the direction of this country, if you want to win a new era for America’s workers, if you want to guarantee that all work has dignity, let’s get the PRO Act across the finish line!This is a moment for unions, a moment made by unions. Made and crafted by IUPAT! And when we make the PRO Act the law of the land, we’re going to bring more working people together and give working people more power. And on that day, you mark my words, we will have one hell of a celebration.Thank you. And God bless you.

133,Trumka: Workers First Agenda Will Build Sustainable Economy and Stronger Democracy,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-workers-first-agenda-will-build-sustainable-economy-and-stronger-democracy,1-12-2021,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka held a press call to introduce the Workers First Agenda to fight back against COVID-19 and build an economy that puts more power and prosperity into the hands of working people. He also discussed the role the labor movement has in preserving democracy after last week’s riot incited by President Trump. He delivered the following remarks:Good morning. Thank you for joining this call.I’m excited to talk about our Workers First Agenda, but I want to start with a few words about what happened in Washington last week. And in particular, why it matters to working people.The future of America’s labor movement is intertwined with the fate of democracy. Our democracy is not promised on a piece of paper. It’s up to us. It lives in us. It’s personal for us.Unions both thrive on and contribute to democracy.What happened at the Capitol was the result of many things. Economic and political systems failing to serve the majority of working people. The Electoral College being so arcane that a president and members of Congress thought they could manipulate the rules to steal an election. Fear. Hate. Disinformation. Conspiracies. And yes, white supremacy.If striking workers stormed the Capitol, tactical teams would have been deployed in seconds. And if people of color had crossed the barricades, a massacre would have followed.Last week was a new low for the outgoing administration. An administration that has driven America to the brink of depression and civil war. Americans are shocked, but we should not be surprised. And we cannot give a pass to a president responsible for sedition.That is why the AFL-CIO’s general board called on President Trump to resign or to be removed from office. He incited this insurrection. He pushed judges and lawmakers to overturn democratic election results. He knew exactly what he was doing.There was no voter fraud—we all know that. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz know that. Even Trump knows that. Trump is outraged because Black and Brown Americans voted, and their votes counted. In cities like Atlanta and Detroit and Philadelphia, Americans of all creeds and colors voted against Trump and for a Workers First Agenda.An agenda that has newfound momentum with last week’s victories in Georgia.A pro-worker House. A pro-worker Senate. And the most pro-worker president since Lyndon Johnson. What a great opportunity. And what a great responsibility.Today, we are unveiling the Workers First Agenda. It is bold, comprehensive and exactly what America needs to meet this moment of pain and uncertainty.At the center of this agenda is the PRO Act—Protecting the Right to Organize. This worker empowerment legislation would allow millions to freely and fairly form a union. So we can raise wages and expand health care. So we can make workplaces safer and retirement more secure. So we can expand opportunities for women, immigrants, people of color and the LGBTQ community.The PRO Act is more than labor law reform legislation. It’s an economic stimulus bill. It’s a civil rights package. So we are going to fight like hell to pass it. An MIT study shows that more than 60 million Americans would join a union today if they could. And that number has increased during this pandemic.No American should ever have to choose between our health and a paycheck. That is why workers’ safety is another priority of our agenda. We will never get this pandemic under control if we cannot protect working people. That starts with emergency COVID-19 OSHA and MSHA standards so we can protect workers from this virus. We must also expand access to free vaccines and rapid testing, and ensure an adequate supply of PPE by executive order and through the Defense Production Act. And it is long past time to guarantee paid sick days, paid family leave and child care for all working people. None of this is controversial—just common sense. More than 325,000 Americans are dead.Worker safety is how we begin to beat the virus. Investment in good jobs—union jobs—and infrastructure built by union workers is how we start to recover from it. Strengthening worker power and rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure is at the core of Joe Biden’s Build Back Better agenda. These promises resonate with our members, especially after Trump promised us the moon and gave us the shaft. It is time to invest trillions of dollars—that’s trillions with a T—to rebuild our roads, bridges, schools and energy systems with union wages and standards.And as we start to rebuild, we must remember that any hope for recovery is impossible without equity. That is why racial justice is a key component of this agenda. Structural racial inequity exists in nearly every facet of our country. Our workplaces, our health care system, our criminal justice system. This has always been true but never been clearer. It’s why the incoming administration should appoint a racial equity czar. We need someone dedicated to leading an interagency task force that directly addresses racial injustice in all the places it exists.And we need to rebuild the safety net for everyone who lives and works here. That means economic security for everybody. Health care security. Retirement security. Food and housing security. This will never be a reality if we don’t strengthen Social Security or shore up multiemployer pensions. If we don’t lower prescription drug prices and lower the Medicare eligibility age to 50. If we don’t strengthen existing health care protections or rebuild the broken unemployment system.Look, none of this will be easy, but all of it is necessary. When Americans casted their ballots in this seminal election, this is what they voted for. This is why working people poured our blood, sweat and tears into this campaign season. We did it to win a Workers First Agenda.I started working in the mines as a teenager and have been a union member ever since. America’s labor movement has never been more united than we are today.In one week and one day, Joe Biden will be inaugurated. We are ready to work with him every day that follows. To heal our country. To empower working people. And to build a sustainable economy and a stronger democracy for generations to come.It’s time to go big. Working people expect nothing less.Thank you. I’ll now open it up for questions.

134,Trumka: Federal Government Must Act to Protect Workers,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-federal-government-must-act-protect-workers,11-16-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a roundtable with President-Elect Joe Biden, Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris and leaders from the business community and labor movement about how to keep workers safe in the face of COVID-19. Thank you, Cecilia (Munoz).On behalf of the 55 unions and 12.5 million members of the AFL-CIO, it is an honor to join my fellow leaders in labor and business for today’s discussion.Mr. President-elect and Madame Vice President-elect, there are many things we can do to keep workers safe from COVID-19.We need to manufacture the respirators and personal protective equipment that continue to be in short supply.We need to make the investments to retrofit our workplaces and schools to meet the ventilation and distancing requirements scientists and workplace safety experts tell us are absolutely vital.We need to make sure all COVID-19 cases are counted and reported so we know where the major outbreaks are before they get worse.But with close to 200,000 Americans becoming infected every day and workers dying at alarming rates, especially in communities of color, the most important thing we can do on day one is to reestablish OSHA’s mission of protecting workers.For four years, OSHA has been AWOL. There’s been no full-time director.There are fewer inspectors today than at any point in the agency’s history. OSHA has been totally absent during this pandemic and workers across industries have been left to fend for ourselves.One of the best ways OSHA can reestablish its mission is through an emergency temporary standard to protect workers from COVID-19.We’ve petitioned for it. We’ve sued for it. I can tell you that working people voted for it. We cannot afford to wait any longer.President-elect Biden will remember that the Obama administration was developing a strong enforceable standard that would have provided employers both the tools and the mandate to protect workers from infectious diseases.President Trump scrapped it upon taking office, part of his reckless and dangerous deregulation agenda. Now that America has elected the Biden-Harris team, the standard must go forward.An emergency standard would quickly put in place requirements for employers across the country as we enter this very difficult period in the pandemic.And it would set in motion a six-month timeline to create a long overdue permanent standard so we are better prepared if and when the next outbreak occurs.The president-elect rightfully reminds us that a job is about more than a paycheck—it’s about dignity. And if we believe that all work has dignity, then all workplaces need to focus on safety.It’s not too late to save tens of thousands of lives.That starts with a strong COVID-19 safety standard on day one.

135,Trumka: Joe Biden’s Firewall Was Union Made,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-joe-bidens-firewall-was-union-made,11-5-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at his post-election press conference:Good afternoon. Thank you for joining this call.More than that, thank you for your role in making our democracy strong.I am hopeful that the end of the Trump presidency will bring a newfound respect for the institution of journalism.This has been an unprecedented election. And it came during an unprecedented year.A year of anger and sorrow and civil unrest. A year of unfathomable loss. Loss of jobs and economic security. Loss of life.The U.S. just reported more than 100,000 new COVID-19 infections, the most cases in a single day since pandemic's start.But during this trying year, union members have delivered for America—every day in every way. Stocking the shelves. Moving goods and people. Fighting the fires. Healing the sick.The resilience of unions is the story of 2020. It’s been on display all year.It’s guided by our belief that a better day is still within our reach. And today, I am more confident than ever that better day is near.Joe Biden has won more votes than any candidate for president—ever. And he is on a path to 270 electoral votes.Biden's path to the White House ran through America’s labor movement. Initial toplines from our post-election survey show union members went 58 percent for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. While the general public supported Biden by three points, our members favored him by 21 points.Simply put, we got out the vote. In Wisconsin. In Michigan. In Pennsylvania.Joe Biden’s firewall was union made!And the labor movement is expanding the map. Look at Arizona. Look at Georgia.We’re writing America’s comeback story. And Joe Biden is on track to be our next president.But with a few final states still counting ballots, this is a moment to exercise patience.Tom Petty got it right: “The waiting is the hardest part.” But we waited four years for this election—four VERY long years. We have trust in our system.Every vote must be counted. Voters decide elections. Not judges. Not legislators.Sadly, President Trump does not share that fundamental American belief. His premature declaration of victory was shameful. His tweets claiming electoral votes are destructive. His plan to derail our democracy is dangerous.AFL-CIO members of all political stripes agree. Seventy-eight percent believe the candidates should accept and respect the will of the American people. That includes Biden and Trump voters.Union members love this country because we built this country. And no matter who we supported, we’re ready to rebuild and heal this country. And together, we will defend our democracy.Let me tell you about what happened in Detroit. On Tuesday night, a chaotic scene erupted outside the vote tally room at the TCF Center. Protesters showed up. They harassed and intimidated nonpartisan volunteers who were counting ballots. They screamed “stop the votes” and “stop the counts.” The Michigan AFL-CIO put out an email Wednesday at 3 a.m. asking members to show up and protect our democracy. The outpouring of support was incredible. Union members showed up, peacefully defused the tension and the count proceeded.Later that day, Michigan was called for Joe Biden.That is who we are. That is what we stand for. That is what we are prepared to do.I have a message for anyone who would seek to prevent our votes from being counted. To prevent the electors we choose from being seated. To prevent the duly elected president and vice president from being inaugurated on January 20, 2021.We will not let you take our democracy away from us.Look, we are not declaring victory yet, but we are on our way to putting a compassionate and wise man back in the White House.There will be work to do over these next few days. And no shortage of work over the next four years. While we don’t know the final composition of the Senate, we know our priorities. Our members made it clear. 95 percent say that protecting workers' rights is the top priority for this next congress. And yes, that includes 93 percent of our members who went for Trump.The right to collective bargaining.Fair wages and workplace safety.A voice on the job.The belief that all work has dignity and everyone should retire with security.None of that is red or blue. It’s simply American. It’s what America’s labor movement has fought for in 2020—not just in this election but in our workplaces, too.Union members are meeting the moment. Union voters are ushering in a better day. None of this will be easy, but union members are not afraid of hard work. We do it every day and we see the job through.We’re powerful. We’re united. And we’re ready for change.Thank you.Let’s take some questions.

136,Shuler to the Climate Jobs and Just Transition Summit: The Renewable Sector Must Be Unionized,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-climate-jobs-and-just-transition-summit-renewable-sector-must-be-unionized,9-22-2020,"Thank you, Jeff. I am thrilled to be joining you all virtually for this groundbreaking summit. Thank you to all the leaders and activists of Climate Jobs New York and Cornell ILR’s Worker Institute. It seems like an eternity since we were all together during climate week last fall.In these unpredictable and chaotic times, it’s a comfort to be in a space full of dedicated and visionary people who are looking toward the future and want to work together to make progress. This is a historically significant moment in our nation and the world. On climate, racism, inequality and democracy. We’ve reached a critical juncture and the outcome is far from clear.The effects of climate change are all around us. Look at the wildfires out West—shocking, but now almost routine. Mass devastation in many towns. Entire neighborhoods have been leveled. The air is unbreathable. Lives have been lost.For me, this hits close to home. I grew up in Clackamas County, Oregon, which was in the epicenter of the evacuation zone. My 73-year-old father still lives there in my childhood home, and my sister lives in southeast Portland.Oregon was reported to have the worst air quality IN THE WORLD over the weekend. I know from talking to family that, before the rain on Friday, the smoke was so bad people couldn’t go outside.It’s obvious to most of us that these extreme weather events are related to climate change, even though many of our political leaders continue to bury their heads in the sand. They want to pit us against each other and make it seem like it’s an “either-or” scenario: “Either” good jobs “or” a clean environment. But that’s a false choice because we can have both. The labor movement has a unique role to play to make sure that happens and that working people are put first.I come out of the IBEW, out of the electric utility sector. My family was supported by a good union job that was fueled by a mix of natural gas, some coal, hydro and nuclear power. I know the sacrifices workers in the industry make. I have met mineworkers in Southwestern Pennsylvania and oil refinery workers on the Gulf Coast in Galveston—these are the workers in the fossil fuel industry that have sustained this country for generations.And as many of the speakers this morning have said, we are here today to honor that past, AND build a new future. And what Climate Jobs New York and we in the labor movement have figured out, is that we can lower emissions without lowering our standard of living.We often toss around the words “Just Transition,” and talk about what we think energy workers need. What energy workers want first, of course, is to preserve the good, family-sustaining job they have by adopting new technology. But for those who are displaced, a Just Transition should mean a modern-day GI Bill for energy workers, and a Marshall Plan for polluted and disinvested communities. A “Just Transition” most of all means working people driving the decisions and are at the center of building a better, brighter, equitable future.You probably know that our energy unions support technologies that many climate activists don’t want. Carbon capture. Advanced nuclear. Hydrogen for power and industry. These all reduce emissions. They all find some support in the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change—following the science as it were.But we are also ready to grow the good jobs of the future and demand investment in solar, onshore and offshore wind. We need to upgrade our electric grid to keep our nuclear plants open and running safely because they provide 50% of our carbon-free electricity.We need to create more jobs with energy retrofits like the one we did at our headquarters in D.C. in partnership with the Clinton Global Initiative.For workers to truly embrace this transition, we need a positive vision. We need workers to know that the clean energy jobs of the future are good-paying jobs.For our families. For our communities. For this entire country.That means, as Rhiana said, the renewable sector must be unionized. All of it. Good union jobs with wages we can raise our families on. An offshore wind supply chain that lifts up communities all along the East Coast. Because, let’s be honest, the last 40 years have shown that big changes in our economy have not been good for workers, especially communities of color.If we don’t have everyone on board, no matter our differences, we know what that ends up in: Gridlock. And gridlock forces workers to hang onto what they have now and fight like hell to keep it, which leads to more divide. That’s where the labor movement comes in. We can be the bridge.As we grapple with multiple crises at once, we can’t forget in the midst of every crisis lies great opportunity. The energy among progressives is off the charts. Union approval among the public is at its highest in decades—65% in the last Gallup poll.The opportunity of this political moment is a chance to address systemic racism and gender inequities, reverse the long trend of growing inequality that has plagued our country and finally move forward on climate policy.The key to all of this is for workers to have a stronger voice and not one seat, but many seats at the table, driving the changes we need. Because the fight to beat climate change, end racism, and reverse inequality can only be won together. These fights can only be won when workers have more power. When more investments flow to underserved communities, especially communities of color. Places like Flint and Oakland. And yes, the coal towns of Appalachia.Then, and only then, will “equality for all” not just be a phrase but a way of life.Thank you.

137,Trumka on the 57th Anniversary of the 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing: We Can Be Moved Forward,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-57th-anniversary-16th-street-baptist-church-bombing-we-can-be-moved-forward,9-15-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks on the 57th anniversary of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham: Reverend Price and members of the 16th Street Baptist Church, thank you for including us as we remember what happened in your home—a sacred place of both tragedy and unity.Reverend Barber and I have come together today to raise up the voices of the labor movement, the civil rights movement and people of faith everywhere in defense of our democracy and for the triumph of hope over fear, and love over hate.Fifty-seven years ago today, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley, Addie Mae Collins and Denise McNair came to church to be closer to God. And that morning they entered eternity.We'll forever wonder how many more aprons Addie Mae would have sold or how much more Denise would have done for muscular dystrophy research. We think about how many more dances Carole should have danced and how far Cynthia's love for math would have taken her. We feel their emptiness in the pews, where they might still be parishioners today.Instead, as we all remember, dynamite tore through the church. Glass and brick tore through bodies. Grief tore through the hearts of four families and the nation they called home. But that attack could not tear us apart.The fact that we remember these girls and draw inspiration from their martyrdom, proves that unity endured and love prevailed.For the ultimate effect of the bombing was not division, but unity. It strengthened the movement. It hastened the Civil Rights Act. It bolstered the Voting Rights Act. It did the opposite of what the Klan wanted.We stand on the shoulders of Birmingham. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was written in the solidarity and sacrifice of Birmingham’s African-American community.Every time a union leader calls for equal pay, every time a shop steward says to the boss “you can’t do that, it’s discrimination,” every time we cast a vote, we honor the memory of Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole and Denise.But our debt as a labor movement to this community is greater than that. On the day the Ku Klux Klan set off the bomb, parts of the labor movement were racially segregated—including in Birmingham. The divisions and hatred that landowners and employers had been sowing since the founding of this country infected our own movement.And so when the AFL-CIO fought for the passage of the Civil Rights Act, we were fighting to end discrimination and racism not just by employers, but by our own unions, our own institutions. We were fighting to change ourselves.We believe that people can change and grow and overcome so that history can be made right.We believe that people—and we, the people—don’t stay in the same place forever.We can be moved forward.After all, that is why it is called a movement.America’s labor movement stands with every union member and every person in this country who is demanding justice and striving for the end of racism.Some refuse to learn. Some see what’s happening and resist change or outright refuse it. Worse, some want to return to a dark past that they mythologize as “great.”We cannot let them drag us back and hold us down.In fact, at the trial of one of the Birmingham bombers, then-prosecutor and now-Senator Doug Jones said that the defendant “saw change and didn’t like it.”At this very moment, we see things in our country that we don’t like—and we demand change.Our nation is in a moment of true crisis.A crisis of public health, a crisis of economic injustice and a crisis of structural racism.Beneath all three of them is the question of who gets seen. And who gets heard. And, ultimately, who lives and who dies.This is a crisis of leadership.The day after these four little girls were killed, President John F. Kennedy asked whether the bombing would “awaken this entire nation to a realization of the folly of racial injustice and hatred and violence.”Where is that voice today? Where was that voice in Charlottesville when the Nazis and white supremacists filled the streets?And where is that voice as thousands of our elders and essential workers—disproportionately people of color—are dying from coronavirus?Where is the voice of our nation’s leader?At a time when we need unity, the president is using the power of the federal government to stoke violence and division.He is lying to us about the virus. He continues to block safety standards for our workers and health care for the unemployed.As our veterans died from the coronavirus, he mocked their sacrifice and the memories of America’s fallen heroes.There is only one way to respond to such a catastrophic failure of leadership.That is with solidarity. A rededication to this nation, to the democratic republic that is the United States of America.That only happens with hope. Hope for our people, hope for our future, with certainty that a new day is coming for America—and it is coming because we are going to make it so.Our determination in this hour is to shine a light—the combined light of poor and working people, people of faith, united in the labor and civil rights movements and every place freedom is on the march.We are one in our love for each other.We are one in our determination to win racial, social and economic justice in our nation.We are one in our devotion to our democracy.And we are one in the potential we all have for positive change.Every time I talk with Reverend Barber, he reminds me of his supreme belief in our power.As individuals, as participants in great movements and as a nation.This is a moment when the potential for positive change here in America is all around us.So let us make a new birth of freedom. A new prosperity. A new solidarity. Let us in that spirit defeat the coronavirus, honor the dead and care for the sick.That is what we as a labor movement pledge to do. Each and every one of us.What happened here still saddens us, but it continues to steel us.It is remembered everywhere, through time and space. You can draw a straight line from what was erased on 16th Street in Birmingham to what is written on 16th Street in Washington, four stories high at the AFL-CIO in full view of the White House: Black Lives Matter. That truth is what we affirm by remembering these four little girls.Our belief is their legacy.In the church, there is an iconic stained glass window. It was donated by the people of Wales—total strangers an ocean away.It has five words written on it: “You do it to me.” It’s based on a verse from Matthew 25:40, which preaches the very message we take from this memorial. A call for unity: “Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.”The Lord wants us to live with mercy, love and compassion.We must heed His words.We must respond to crisis with unbridled action.We must answer the greatest needs of our day with love and unity and sheer determination.And let that be our legacy.Thank you. God bless you.

138,Trumka: Love of Workers Has Defined Joe Biden's Life,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-love-workers-has-defined-joe-bidens-life,9-7-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a Labor Day Facebook Live with Vice President Joe Biden: Good afternoon and happy Labor Day! I’m Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO.Vice President Biden, thank you for spending your Labor Day with us. While I wish we were having this conversation in the same room, I’m grateful to Brother Rick Bloomingdale, Brother Frank Snyder and the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO for hosting you and for their leadership in our shared home state.Every day, the AFL-CIO’s 56 affiliated unions and 12.5 members stock the shelves, fight the fires, heal the sick and a whole lot moreWe are not afraid of hard work. We always finish the job. And we’ll never give up on the country we love—the country unions built!Yes, we've been told our time is up and we’ve been knocked down.But in the face of corporate greed and political attacks… Amid a public health crisis, an economic freefall and systemic racism...America’s labor movement has risen!Coronavirus won’t defeat us. Unions will beat COVID-19! Gallup puts union approval at 65 percent, one of our best marks in more than a half century. 60 million workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance.If we want that to happen, then it’s time to move heaven and earth to elect Joe Biden!Joe is a proven champion for working people. I know from firsthand experience.I experienced it five years ago when Joe and I marched together in Pittsburgh's Labor Day parade. The energy was palpable. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets. And Joe jogged the entire route! He not only wanted to shake as many hands as he could. He wanted to talk to as many people as he could. He wanted to hear as many stories as he could. Every employer should give every worker that level of respect.The aspirations of working people fuel Joe. As a senator and vice president, he used his vote and his voice to advance our causes to fight for living wages and health care, civil rights and retirement security and safe jobs protected by OSHA and MSHA. And Joe never lost his core goodness. Not long after I was elected president of the AFL-CIO, I lost my mother.One of the first calls I got was from Vice President Biden. He was there for me during a difficult time, as a friend and a brother. He knew what to say and how to listen. Because Joe is no stranger to grief. He’s lost a spouse and buried children. A few months after that parade, a few weeks after he lost his son Beau, I sat down with Joe for four hours. I saw the pain. I saw a man who loved his family and his country and didn't want to let either down. He wanted to serve both—and Joe Biden has.He fulfilled the promise he made to his grandparents whenever he left their home in Scranton. Joe’s grandfather would tell him to “Keep the faith!” And his grandmother would yell back: “No, Joey, spread it—spread the faith!” Across America, working people have kept the faith. And this year, under impossible circumstances and in dire conditions, we’ve spread the faith, too.But we can’t do it alone. We need a president who believes in the dignity of work, a president who has faith in us! That’s why Joe supports the PRO Act, which would create a fairer process for forming a union. That’s why Joe supports the HEROES Act to protect our paychecks and pensions and public services in the midst of this deadly pandemic. And that’s why he picked Kamala Harris to be his running mate, a champion of social, racial and economic justice and a lifelong friend of unions. Joe and Kamala understand this is NO time to go back to business as usual. Back to an economy marred by bad trade deals and harmful tax cuts that benefit the wealthy. Back to an economy fueled by inequality and indifference. Joe understands it’s time to make structural reforms and build back better!To create millions of good-paying jobs—union jobs!To rebuild our crumbling infrastructure!To ensure the future is ""Made in America"" and union-made! And to finally have a plan to beat COVID-19 and rebuild our economy so it works for all of us. Joe knows workplace safety is more than a policy. It’s a promise to our loved ones that we will return home at the end of a hard day’s work. Joe Biden comprehends something Donald Trump never will: workers will never quit on America, and our president must never quit on workers!Brothers, sisters and friends: I've known Joe Biden for 40 years. He's real. He loves his family. He loves our country. He loves workers. This is not a campaign posture. It is his life.Joe and I grew up 300 miles apart in Pennsylvania. Our families were not rich, but we were given confidence that our generation could do better than the last. Today, we’re both proud grandfathers. Our grandchildren belong to a generation that believes in equality for everybody and the dignity of work. They deserve to be a part of a country that lives up to its founding promise that we are all created equal, endowed by God with certain unalienable rights, chief among them life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Our choice in this election is between division, decline and darkness...or rebuilding America and restoring her promise! A country whose strength comes from unions and whose future depends on the strength of unions!We’re powerful! We’re united! We’re writing America’s comeback story! And nothing and no one will stop us from electing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.Mr. Vice President, working people are ready to make hope and history rhyme! And we’re going to do it with you.Take it away, Vice President Biden. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
139,Trumka: Union Members Will Rebuild America,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-union-members-will-rebuild-america,9-3-2020,"The following are AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka's remarks at the Christian Science Monitor Labor Day Breakfast, as prepared:Thank you, Linda (Feldmann), for that introduction. And thank you all for being here. I hope that wherever you are logging in from, you are healthy and safe. I look forward to this discussion every year as a kickoff to Labor Day. In many ways, it’s a progress report on the American labor movement. And it is a tribute to the leadership and resilience of our movement that—even when the state of our Union is in such disarray—the state of America’s unions is strong. Union members have answered the call of COVID-19. Every day and in every way. We’ve served. We’ve sacrificed. We’ve healed. We’ve done it all. We’ve honored the country we love, the country unions built. And that’s why new research from Gallup released just this morning puts our approval rating at 65 percent, the highest since 2003 and one of our best marks in more than half a century. The problem—and more than that, the clear and present danger—is that too many of our country’s leaders haven’t honored us. They haven’t served us well. They haven’t protected us. They’re letting our country crumble and our people suffer.Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are at the top of that list.Remember what Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats did to make America whole. They passed the HEROES Act on May 15. That’s SIXTEEN weeks ago tomorrow. More than a HUNDRED days. It would protect our paychecks and pensions and public services. It would save lives. But Mitch McConnell and his anti-worker colleagues in the Senate have refused to act. American workers are sitting awake at night—worrying, suffering, mourning. Our bills are mounting up on kitchen tables because that bill sits on Mitch McConnell’s desk. Across America, some governors and mayors have tried to pick up the slack. They deserve credit—but they can’t do it alone. An unprecedented national crisis requires a plan from the top. It requires vision and competence and management skills. It requires humility, agility and perseverance. And yes, compassion—compassion for everyone who calls this country home.The crises we confront today would challenge even America’s most revered presidents. Yet our lives depend on the competence and compassion of Donald Trump. He is simply the worst president to have at the worst time. And the worst part about this devastating moment is that it didn’t have to be this way. In 2016, enough union members defected from the Democratic Party to tip the balance in places like Michigan and my home state of Pennsylvania. And when Trump was elected, I committed to working with the president on issues where we might agree. I owed that to every working person out there, whether they voted for Trump or Hillary Clinton, or didn’t vote at all. Because if working people are strong, America is strong. At the time, trade, infrastructure and manufacturing stood out as areas for common ground. But Donald Trump failed. He failed to seek common ground with us. He failed to consult common sense or demonstrate common decency. He broke his promises on infrastructure and manufacturing. The jobs he said were coming never came. Instead of rebuilding America, he’s torn it apart. And his tax cut for the ultra-rich accelerated the outsourcing of good-paying American jobs and worsened inequality. On trade, yes, working people made some progress. But let’s get the facts right. Speaker Pelosi stood with us in blocking the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement until Trump finally made it enforceable. Never forget: working people rewrote NAFTA. The president just rode our coattails. But it’s more than the broken promises that have made Donald Trump such a reckless president for working people. It’s the relentless, reprehensible attacks. There are too many examples to name this morning, but let me point out just a few. Donald Trump’s appointments, from the Supreme Court to the National Labor Relations Board to the Department of Labor, have made it their mission to undermine collective bargaining. Every rule...every decision...every move...has made it harder to live and work in America. Not since Ronald Reagan fired the air traffic controllers have we seen this level of union-busting from the White House. Donald Trump’s disregard for workplace health and safety has been dangerous, delinquent and deadly. He has never had a full-time director of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. There are fewer OSHA inspectors today than at any point since it was founded. He’s weakened enforcement by the Mine Safety and Health Administration, forcing miners to work in hazardous conditions. As a former miner and as the son and grandson of miners, that offends me personally. And he’s halted new rules on combustible dust, construction noise, silica and even infectious disease. Donald Trump inherited a pandemic playbook from his predecessor and tossed it in the trash. He abandoned a workplace infectious disease standard that would have protected our front-line heroes from COVID-19. And even after the virus hit, he refused to issue a national workplace safety standard, leaving millions vulnerable to infection and in too many cases, death.What have we learned from all of this? We’ve learned that working people cannot afford Donald Trump. We’ve learned that workers might not be able to survive another four years with Donald Trump. Meanwhile, what has Donald Trump learned? Absolutely nothing. After months of pandemic politics and generations of systemic racism, Trump is pouring gasoline on the fire. It is a transparent, ugly, last-ditch effort to scare some people into voting for him and scare others away from voting at all. Our country is sick, and Donald Trump is making it worse. Our economy is weakening, and Donald Trump is making it worse. America is hurting, and Donald Trump is making it worse. America needs healing, and he gives us division. America needs hope, and he gives us tweets. Here is the plain truth: For the good of the country we love, working people gave Donald Trump every last chance to prove himself. But it’s clearer than ever that for working people to defeat the coronavirus, economic inequality and systemic racism, we’re going to have to remove this dangerous president from the White House. Working people are ready to keep pushing America forward. We’re ready to organize and form new unions. We’re ready to mobilize and pass the HEROES Act and the PRO Act so workers can join a union freely and fairly. We’re ready to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and union members and allies from coast to coast. We’re ready to get out the vote and then protect those votes. There is still nothing stronger than a united American labor movement! In May of 1964, President Lyndon Johnson shared his vision of a Great Society. It was a vision of health and education and American community. But more than anything else, it was a vision built on the idea that we have the agency to make our future.LBJ said: “There are those timid souls who say this battle cannot be won; that we are condemned to a soulless wealth. I do not agree. We have the power to shape the civilization that we want. But we need your will, your labor, your heart.” This is a scary time. Donald Trump’s America is a dangerous place. And there are those who right now are again predicting our country’s demise. But America’s unions know better! America’s workers prove it every day!This Labor Day, with our will and our heart, we are ready to carry the nation we love through this dark day and shape a greater society.This fall, with our votes, union members will secure the future we want and save the country we’ve built.Thank you. And God bless you. I look forward to your questions. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
140,Shuler at March on Washington: We Must Do Better,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-march-washington-we-must-do-better,8-28-2020,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks at the March on Washington:Hello, my name is Liz Shuler, Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO...America’s unions! 12.5 million working people in 55 unions from all across the economy, saying BLACK LIVES MATTER. Thank you Reverend Al Sharpton, NAN and Martin Luther King III for bringing us together.As we stand on the shoulders of Dr. King, Congressman John Lewis, A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin and all the brave souls who marched together 57 years ago, we know, as a nation, we must do better.Black Americans know the bank of justice IS bankrupt.Justice was denied to Jacob Blake and George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks because they were Black. Justice was out of reach for Riah Milton and Dominique Fells, two black trans women who were killed earlier this summer. Union members have been out in the streets protesting these injustices. Professional athletes, many of them proud union members, have stood up in ways they never have before. The Milwaukee Bucks players said enough is enough, and the NBA playoffs are now on hold. WNBA players have spoken out...Major League Baseball...soccer...and more.Whether it’s in professional sports...or in our communities...we in the labor movement are feeling excruciating pain, anger and grief. We will do our part to end racism in our economy, our politics, our workplaces AND our union halls. And on top of the widespread racism throughout our country’s institutions, COVID-19 is exposing the cracks that were already poisoning our system. A system that denies housing and health care and opportunity to far too many people of color. That’s why Black and brown people are more likely to lose their jobs or get sick and die in this pandemic. We have to do better. Now...NOW is the time to do the work and pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that are sitting in the Senate.As a white person, I know that I will never experience the same pain and trauma that Black people have been feeling over and over again.All I can say is I understand what I can’t possibly understand. But I choose to stand. And to kneel. And raise a fist. And shed a tear. And say a prayer. And fight like hell to make real change. As one united labor movement, we stand with our Black members, friends and neighbors.Our mission is to empower families and communities to reach their dreams. That’s why we’re in this movement. It’s how we inch closer to achieving Dr. King’s Dream from 57 years ago.It’s how we wake up America.And it’s how we TOGETHER continue the march of those who marched before us.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

Your leadership is building a stronger labor movement in Alaska for working people, our families and retirees.And I want to thank you for your commitment to identifying a coordinator from every local union in Alaska.To all my brothers and sisters in Alaska, you’ve shown courage and compassion in the face of incredible crisis.You are proving that our power is not limited to some states or some regions.We take our power—the power of a united labor movement—where we want to.And we exercise our power in Alaska.On June 17, the labor movement planted our flag in the ground with the Workers First Caravan for Racial and Economic Justice. There were 608 events in all 50 states, D.C. and Puerto Rico—including in Alaska.Under the leadership of the state fed, the caravans put on by the Juneau, Fairbanks and Anchorage Central Labor Councils were powerful and effective.Quite frankly, it was inspirational to the entire labor movement across the United States.Cars and trucks with signs reading “Union Members for Black Lives” and “State and Local Funding Now” made their way through downtown Juneau, passing by the Alaska State Capitol.Union members demanded that Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan support the HEROES Act.To prioritize worker safety and public services. To protect pensions and paychecks.To invest in infrastructure and public schools.To guarantee health care and vital public services. The next day, the mobilizations of Alaska's labor unions made the front page of The Juneau Empire!You don’t need me to tell you there is a lot on the line in Alaska. Too many people are out of work because of the coronavirus pandemic through no fault of their own.The working people of the Marine Highway are vulnerable because of the erratic and irresponsible actions of Governor Mike Dunleavy. Before the pandemic, the governor made major budget cuts. Now city, burrough and state workers face even more painful rollbacks. And frontline workers face unsafe conditions and an uncertain future.During this season of unprecedented crisis, Alaska's unions—and America’s labor movement—are a beacon of solidarity. Our members are heroically and resiliently confronting a pandemic that is still raging, economic pain with no end in sight and the cancer of systemic racism. Once again, our nation, from Kenosha to Kodiak, is feeling sorrow and sadness and everything in between. Like so many of you, I saw the video of Jacob Blake being shot by a police officer. Shot seven times in the back.Shot seven times with his children in the car.Brothers and sisters, this is nothing new.George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks.We need to say their names. We remember names like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Medgar Evers.Eric Garner and Trayvon Martin.But this list keeps growing. So many Black lives and bodies harmed.Yes, let’s say Black Lives Matter. But it’s time to do more. To be more. To understand why this keeps happening to Black people in America.The tough truth is Black people have been murdered since slaves first arrived in Jamestown in 1619.And here we are today.Still facing an economic and political system that seems unable or unwilling to deliver justice for communities of color.We must never grow weary. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.This is a time to challenge ourselves. To better ourselves. To build the labor movement America needs.And that means looking inward and making reforms. At times, those conversations and our decisions will be downright uncomfortable, but that’s the point.This year, we’ve seen a wave of collective action. It continued last night.Athletes across the NBA, WNBA, MLB and MLS are boycotting games, protesting racial injustice and showing the strength of solidarity.We’ve heard pundits try to dismiss them as celebrities. That is wrong.Athletes may have massive platforms, but they are workers. Workers who are often members of a union.If you watch the video of the Milwaukee Bucks players’ statement, you can see them physically standing together.  You can see that some of them are outside their comfort zone—just as we all were the first time we stood up on the job. And yet they stood together!And showed the unmatched power of collective action!As one united labor movement, we must be at the tip of the spear, pushing for racial justice for our members, our friends and our communities.As Americans, we must recognize the difference between right and wrong, and we must always stand up for what is right.The COVID-19 moment—with all of its challenges and complications—is testing us. And how have we answered the call? With nothing but our solidarity, our commitment to economic and racial justice, and our belief—our intense, passionate belief—that our darkest hours will not define our lives or our nation. A better day is coming—but only because working people will make it so.In America, we have the right to expect that our leaders—our democratically elected leaders—will share in those values.  Even when we disagree on almost everything, we share that basic optimism, that fundamental belief in our country and our people and the future we could build together.Like many of you, I’m sure, I watched parts of this week’s Republican National Convention—a virtual event whose purpose was to persuade us to vote for President Trump. While I was watching, I kept an eye out for the optimism and love for our country, which elected officials of all stripes have sought to project to us.And I couldn’t find it. What did I find instead? I found a gathering shrouded in darkness.Speaker after speaker was animated by division and malice.  I felt like I was listening to a gathering not in America but in some decaying empire, where a fading emperor and his family fought over control of the palace while outside the gates plague, economic ruin and foreign enemies circled around us.That is not us. That is not the country we love. That will not be the country we rebuild. Yes, we face a tough situation with the virus and the economy, with economic and racial injustice. We are mourning the deaths of nearly 180,000 people who shouldn’t have died. We are going to work without the PPE we need if we’re lucky enough to have a job. And all of us are feeling the anxiety of putting food on the table, filling that prescription and making that next rent or mortgage payment. America’s labor movement is meeting these challenges. Alaska’s working people, America’s essential working people, keep us safe and fed every day despite the danger.Danger on the rigs, in the meatpacking plants, at our schools.  Brothers and sisters, I still believe in an America where the solidarity of working people makes us who we are as a nation. Where even in our darkest moments, we live in the light of family, of solidarity, of democracy.I often think of the man I was raised to admire above all others in politics in the coal mining town I grew up in. That man was President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  And I thought of how he said: “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”  And then I thought, who in American public life today tells us to set aside fear, tells us what we can do to help each other rather than fueling our fear of what we might do to harm each other.   A person who knows working people, not someone who pretends he is a friend of working people. Someone who understands you can’t fix the economy until you get the virus under control with a plan. Someone who cares enough to fight for our lives, our health, our jobs, our families. That man is Vice President Joe Biden. And in 68 days, we need to make him president.And so as we go into the Labor 2020 program, I need to ask you something straight up. Do you want to live in a country governed by hatred and fear?  If you do, President Trump is your man. And so is Mitch McConnell and the rest of his anti-worker friends on Capitol Hill like Senator Dan Sullivan who time and time again vote against our interests.But we in the labor movement know it’s time for a better day. For light rather than darkness. For solidarity rather than division. And that’s why the AFL-CIO endorsed Joe Biden for president and Kamala Harris for vice president.  And that is why you and everyone you know needs to organize not next week, not next month, but now.So we can defeat the apostles of delay, division and disenfranchisement across our country.  So we can elect people to represent us who know what America means and what she stands for.We are in the home stretch of this election. That may feel strange, but that’s because this year is different.Election Day truly begins when the mail-in ballots are sent out.  Donald Trump and his handpicked Postmaster General have set out to do just enough damage to the Postal Service to frighten us into not voting by mail. But their plan didn’t work. Why?  Because we fought it with everything we had—in the streets, at the bargaining table, in Congress and in the courts—and today our half a million brothers and sisters who work for the Postal Service tell us without hesitation your ballot will be delivered and counted.We should learn a lesson here.  Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell are going to throw everything they can at us. But we can beat them if we stand together, organize together and get out the vote together. It’s time to fight like hell to pass the HEROES Act and pass the PRO Act!To protect Social Security! To fund the Postal Service and uphold democracy! The Alaska labor movement has a long and proud history of working with Democrats, Republicans and independents who are willing to work with us. This election is not about party. It’s about possibility!And here is the simple truth: we cannot possibly get a fair shake with this Senate and this White House. They see us as expendable. So we need to expend our energy electing friends and champions and union members to every office in the land. We have to make sure all the votes get in and that they all are fairly counted. This is what Labor 2020 is all about.And if we do that job, we will have a new president and a new Senate Majority Leader.A new senator from Alaska and new pro-worker elected across this great state.Brothers and sisters, we have the chance to win a bright new day in America—a union day!This is a moment for union leadership, and we won’t back up or back down. Not now. Not ever! We drive the trucks and fly the planes.We package, print and power the state.We do what it takes. We always answer the call and always meet the moment!Union members wake our country up every single morning, and drive her during the day. We don’t mind hard work. We want to get back work! We demand dignity and fight for equality! We won’t be faced down or pushed around!We are America's labor movement and we will not be denied!Thank you. May God bless you and keep you safe!

142,Trumka to DNC Labor Council: Our Democracy Is at Stake,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-dnc-labor-council-our-democracy-stake,8-17-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the 2020 Democratic National Convention Labor Council Meeting:I want to thank my longtime friend, Brother Stuart [Appelbaum], for that introduction. And I want to thank Chairman [Tom] Perez, for his great leadership. As we convene this meeting of the Labor Council, as we begin four days of a Democratic convention unlike any other, working people are counting on us more than ever because working people are doing more for us than ever. Right now, in big cities and small towns, union members are on the job. A pandemic is not stopping us from lifting the loads, stocking the shelves and fighting the fires. From healing the suffering and teaching our children. And while many of us are joining this meeting and watching this convention from the comfort of our homes, too many working people are wondering if they will be able to keep their home or make next month’s rent. They are choosing between groceries and prescriptions. Millions are out of work through no fault of their own. As travel halts. And shows stop. And our economy grinds to a halt.These workers did their job and they did it well, but our president refused to do his. Donald Trump did not create the coronavirus, but his utter incompetence, his inaction and his lack of basic compassion have made COVID-19 worse. Instead of pouring himself into a national response plan, the president is pouring gasoline on the fire! He downplayed the threat, called it a hoax and ignored the experts. 173 days ago, the president said we would soon have zero coronavirus cases. There have been 5.4 million cases and 170,000 deaths. So what does President Trump have to say about that? “It is what it is.”Try telling “it is what it is” to the family of Tiran Billups. Tiran began his New Jersey Transit career in 1996 as a bus operator in Maplewood. He proudly served as the president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 819. When this pandemic hit, he fought to protect frontline workers, his brothers, sisters and friends. In June, Tiran lost his own fight to COVID-19. Thousands of working families are grieving the loss of a loved one. In the past, presidents of both parties have comforted the grieving and rallied our nation in times of tragedy, summoning our better angels to come together for the common good. From this White House, there is no sorrow, just deception. No call for unity, just division and talk of domination. No hope, just fear. Some people tell me: “But Rich, the president is plain spoken. I like that.” Fair enough, but so is the drunk at a bar. And far too often, this president’s belligerent words have demeaned, divided and deceived.In fact, on Friday, the president boasted: “My administration’s decisive actions have yielded truly incredible results.” Shirley Thomas, an AFSCME member in Florida, does not see those truly incredible results, Mr. President. She was a public-school custodian for more than 19 years. And over those 19 years, her motivation stayed the same: she loved being around students. She treated them like her own, with care and love. In April, she was furloughed. There is no telling when or if she will get to go back to work safely. Shirley is diabetic. Without health care, her medications are so expensive that she was forced to ration what she had left. She’s canceled a procedure to remove a blood clot. Here’s how Shirley put it: “My job gave me stability to take care of my kids. It gave me stability knowing that I would be able to retire. Overnight that stability is gone, but I will continue to live by prayer.”I pray for Shirley. But she and millions of working people just like her need more than a prayer. They need real relief! They need real leadership! They need Joe Biden in the White House!The AFL-CIO endorsed Joe Biden because we know Joe, and Joe knows us. Joe knows a job is about more than a paycheck, it’s about dignity. It’s about respect. Joe knows why worker safety must be more than a priority. It must be a guarantee. A promise to our loved ones that we will return home safely at the end of a hard day’s work. It’s why he’s always fought to strengthen OSHA, not gut it like Trump. Joe knows that Wall Street didn’t build America, the middle class did. And as he told the AFL-CIO, the middle class was built by unions. Joe Biden will sign the PRO Act into law so the 60 million Americans who want to join a union can do so freely and fairly.Joe also knows our democracy is under siege. Look no further than what Donald Trump is doing with the Post Office. He’s threatening America’s most trusted public service with attacks and lies and extortion. And he’s doing this for one simple reason: to suppress the vote. Donald Trump knows that when we vote, he loses. Well I have a message today for the president, the Postmaster General and anyone who would attack our Postal Service. We’re going to fight you. We’re going to beat you. And America’s unionized postal workers, letter carriers and mail handlers are going to deliver every last ballot no matter what you throw at them. And on November 3, the Postal Service will be more than happy to process Donald Trump’s change of address form.You see, this election is about more than red and blue. It’s a fight for our democracy itself. And in a battle for justice, it helps to have a warrior like Kamala Harris. As California’s attorney general, she held big banks accountable in the wake of the housing crisis. She prosecuted employers for stealing our wages and advanced criminal justice reform. In the Senate, she has been fighting alongside union members to pass the HEROES Act so we can provide overdue relief to our families and communities. She is a champion in every sense of the word, which is why she has a perfect lifetime rating from the AFL-CIO.Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the right team for working people. To beat this virus. To save lives and livelihoods. To win a better day. But when that day comes, our woes won’t be behind us. That’s when the real work of rebuilding begins.Our economy is a set of rules. And those rules are written by the people we elect. They help pick the winners and the losers. And for four decades, working people have too often been left behind. Every day, we experience more suffering, fueled by the politics and economics of inequality. Inequality of income and inequality of opportunity, all rooted in inequality of power.It is time to change the power dynamics in America. It is time to build an America where workers are paid fair wages and corporations pay fair taxes. Where health care is a right and a pension is a promise. Where workplaces are safe and it’s easier to form a union than bust one. And where systemic racism and sexism and homophobia and transphobia are called out and rooted out and cast into the dustbin of history. This moment demands that we pick a side. We have an obligation to confront these tough truths, to adopt a party platform—a pro-worker platform—that is bold in scope and size. None of that will be easy. But what working people are doing every day is not easy.We are heroically and resiliently battling this virus. And when we send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House, when we elect union members and union allies up and down the ticket, we will have leaders who will help us beat this virus. Leaders who will finally and truly rewrite the rules of our economy.All of you know I’m a grandfather. My grandchildren are the joy of life. They deserve a country where everyone who works hard has the opportunity to succeed. They belong to a generation that believes in the dignity of work and equality for everybody. They deserve to be a part of a generation that achieves more and prospers more. One that goes further and does better than the one I belong to. Over these next four days, over these next four years, we need to put America on that path!We face a choice in this election. It’s a choice between more division and decline, or rebuilding and reviving the country we love. A country built by unions. A country run by unions. So I want to ask all of you today: are you ready to fight? Are you ready to vote? Are you ready to build an America that works for all of us?There is no challenge too great. No mountain too high. No job too hard. We are the American labor movement and we will not—WE WILL NOT—be denied!Thank you. And may God bless you.

143,"Trumka: ""Pass the HEROES Act Now"" ",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-pass-heroes-act-now,8-6-2020,"Good afternoon. Thank you for joining this call. I hope everyone is staying safe and staying healthy.Let me also acknowledge the other labor leaders on this call:For months, the AFL-CIO and our affiliate unions have rallied behind America’s Five Economic Essentials. These essentials found a home in the HEROES Act. And we are fighting every day to make this legislation the law of the land. A lot of people are focused on the final 89 days of this election season—and for good reason. Every day, 1,000 Americans are dying from COVID-19. And what does our president have to say? ""It is what it is.""President Trump is a dangerous combination of incompetence and indifference. And the labor movement is going to defeat him in November. But there is another number we need to focus on: 83. It’s been 83 days since the House did their job and passed the HEROES Act. But for 83 days and counting, that bill has been sitting on Mitch McConnell’s desk. And during those 83 days, 79,000 Americans have died.Where is the sense of urgency?McConnell told us to “pause” in May. He wanted to see if we really needed another coronavirus relief bill. After more than nearly 160,000 dead, after a massive spike in the number of cases, after an economic catastrophe that rivals the Great Depression, we are still waiting for action. The McConnell proposal cuts unemployment benefits, which expired last week. There is nothing for state and local governments. Nothing about worker safety and OSHA. Nothing to protect our pensions.No wonder McConnell and the White House are scrambling. As negotiations go nowhere, working people are suffering.McConnell claims America “needs another shot of adrenaline.” Well, the HEROES Act is that antidote. And the time for waiting is over. The HEROES Act needs a vote now.Together, America’s labor movement is working to make that happen. Across the country, America’s labor movement is mobilizing. On June 17, we had the Workers First Caravan for Racial and Economic Justice. There were 608 events in all 50 states, D.C. and Puerto Rico. We brought more than a thousand cars and shut down the Capitol with one simple message: SENATE ACT NOW! 

We’ve continued to flex our muscles and raise our voices in the days and weeks since. We’ve made over 107,000 phone calls to Senate offices. But senators are not just hearing from us. They are seeing us, too. We've continued mobilizing, with approximately 500 registered events in all 50 states, D.C. and Puerto Rico, focused on pressuring the Senate to pass the HEROES Act.

In Miami, the South Florida Central Labor Council’s caravan circled Senator Rubio and Senator Scott’s offices.In Denver, the Colorado AFL-CIO and the Denver Area Labor Federation led a mock funeral procession by the offices of Senator Gardner, calling attention to the working people who died while the Senate failed to act. 

In the Hawkeye State, the Iowa AFL-CIO held a virtual town hall on the need to pass the HEROES Act. There was an empty chair for Senator Joni Ernst, who failed to show up.We are participating in car caravans, setting up Zoom meetings with senators and driving calls to the Senate. Each of these actions has the same demand: Pass the HEROES Act NOW!Working people are acting heroically and resiliently in the face of this pandemic—and we will beat this pandemic. But we can’t do this alone. The stakes have never been higher. The urgency has never been greater.I’m a student of history. I love learning about events and movements but also the leaders and people who shaped them. One day, my grandchildren will read about what happened in America in 2020. And when they read about the crises this country faced, they will read that America’s labor unions joined together and won a new day for working people and the communities we call home.So let me close with this. To Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer: stand strong. To the White House and Mitch McConnell: get real. 

We may be hurting, but we will never back down. We will never give up. And mark my words: we will remember in November. Thank you. I now want to introduce one of our great champions, D. Taylor, president of UNITE HERE.

144,Trumka to the 2020 Summit for Civil Rights: We Are Moral Visions and Legacies,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-2020-summit-civil-rights-we-are-moral-visions-and-legacies,7-31-2020,"Good afternoon. Thank you to the Workers’ Rights Institute at Georgetown University Law School, the University of Minnesota Law School’s Journal of Law and Inequality, the Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity, and Building One America. While I wish we were together, our solidarity, our love, cannot be contained in a single room.This week, Representative John Lewis wrote to us from beyond the veil of death. He told us about a voice he heard on a radio when he was in high school. That voice said, “we are all complicit when we tolerate injustice.” That was the voice of Dr. Martin Luther King. But that is not all John Lewis told us. He challenged us to “continue to build union between movements stretching across the globe because we must put away our willingness to profit from the exploitation of others.”We are gathered under the banner of a Jesuit institution and in those words, I hear echoes of our Jesuit Pope Francis. And it is in that spirit of solidarity, of defiance of injustice, and yes, of love of each other and of our country, that we gather today.In a moment, we’ll join several foundation leaders. All of us represent institutions. But our institutions are more than institutions. We are moral visions and legacies. And we have been, and must be, the foundations, the seedbeds of a great movement, a movement for racial and economic justice that is on the verge of sweeping across America.Many of you know I first went to work in the coal mines of Western Pennsylvania. I’m a proud member of the United Mine Workers of America. In 1890, at our founding convention, the United Mine Workers banned discrimination against any member based on race, national origin or religion. We never had a Jim Crow local in the Mine Workers because we learned the hard way that the mine owners treated us all equally. And by equally, I mean bad.So yes, the United Mine Workers are an institution but we are also a moral legacy. And so are the institutions represented by leaders here today like Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation. During the civil rights movement, the Ford Foundation supported public defenders, legal aid and litigation to advance racial justice. Just as the Steelworkers paid Dr. King’s bail. Just as the Auto Workers paid for the microphones that John Lewis and Dr. King spoke into during the March on Washington. And yet our institutions bring complex legacies to the table. The labor movement had segregated locals. We were involved in episodes of racial violence. We must acknowledge our own painful pasts and recognize how the past shapes the present. That’s what confronting structural racism requires. We have a moral obligation to get it right. To make Dr. King’s dream our future. To live for the causes John Lewis marched for. To win a better day.Change is coming in America. I can feel it. I see it when I look at the House of Labor, which is now on Black Lives Matter Plaza. I see that change when I look at streets full of young people demanding justice. On picket lines and in voting booths, I see a better day coming.In that better day, no one will live in fear of violence at the hands of those who are sworn to protect them because they are Black or because of their sexual orientation or identity.In that better day, no one will fear being fired because they demand a safe workplace, or speak out for justice on the job.In that better day, we won’t have to fear that our votes won’t be counted, or our democratic republic attacked—whether by armed men in the streets or robed judges in our courts.In that better day, the fruits of our labor and the wealth of human invention will not be pocketed by a handful of billionaires, but will be the foundation of better lives for disenfranchised Americans.That future may feel unobtainable right now. This pandemic is getting worse by the day. Every day, we hear of more economic suffering, fed by the politics and economics of immense inequality. And the cancer of structural racism continues to eat away at our country. It’s shaping who lives and dies from the virus. Who must work and who can stay safe. Who has health care and who dies. This moment demands that we decide which side we’re on. Because together, we have a moral obligation to confront these truths.We can’t deny this virus has disproportionately sickened and killed Black people. People of color, especially women of color, are more likely to be out of a job. Make no mistake about it: economic inequality is racially structured. Coronavirus is only the latest tragic reminder of that. The rules are written to benefit those at the top. And those at the top are overwhelmingly white. The Supreme Court favors business over people. It continues to gut voting rights laws. That entrenches systemic racism deeper into the fabric of our society. And it exacerbates the inequality of power. It feels like we’re on a trajectory toward greater inequality in power, inequality in income, inequality in opportunity—and that the result will be catastrophic.We must stop this. We must make structural changes. We have done it before in America. Never perfectly, but we have done it. We fought a Civil War, and propelled by the courage and determination of freed slaves in uniform, we ended slavery. During the Great Depression, millions of America’s workers rose up and demanded industrial democracy. For decades in this country after that uprising, economic inequality declined, driven by the economic and political power of the collective bargaining system that men and women like my parents literally bled for. And we honor John Lewis because he was a great leader in America’s civil rights movement and our moral compass. We went from being a country where John Lewis protested “Whites Only” signs to a country where John Lewis became the “Conscience of Congress.”We are on the verge of a moment when structural change can happen. But our institutions have to be the incubators, the funders, the midwives of change. So when I say we need to confront these crises, I mean we must coordinate our work. We must do as John Lewis asked of us and “continue to build unity between movements.” Let’s be honest with ourselves: we haven’t really done enough to build that unity. So if we want bold structural change, if we hunger for that better day, we can’t keep living in our own little worlds. As large as we think our institutions are, as powerful as we think we are, by ourselves, we can’t defeat white supremacy nor bring the structural change needed to reverse inequality.As we face the challenge of the coronavirus, of the wreckage structural racism and economic injustice have wrought, of the 2020 election, let us remember what Dr. King once said about that which we seek to change: “Our needs are identical with labor’s needs: decent wages, fair working conditions, livable housing, old-age security, health and welfare measures, conditions in which families can grow, have education for their children, and respect in the community. That is why Negroes support labor’s demands and fight laws which curb labor. That is why the labor-hater and labor-baiter is virtually always a twin-headed creature, spewing anti-Negro epithets from one mouth and anti-labor propaganda from the other mouth.”Sixty years after Dr. King spoke these words, they echo today. In warehouses, in nursing homes and in schools where students and educators are being forced into unsafe conditions. In detention centers where our government keeps children in cages. In the numbers that define our economy and our nation’s health. The grotesque disparities in wealth and income that shape the lives of all working people, especially working people of color.Dr. King died bringing forth a new day. He died on a union picket line, with African American sanitation workers on strike for the right to collectively bargain. From the moment he was recruited by the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters leader in Montgomery to lead the bus boycott, to the moment he died on the balcony in Memphis, he lived the unity of movements.How can we do less in the face of the towering injustice, the terrifying threats and the astounding opportunities of our moment in history?How can we not do everything in our power, together, to bring a new day?The torch lit by Dr. King was carried forward by Congressman Lewis. That torch is now ours to carry onward together. Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
145,Trumka Presents Hong Kong's Civil Human Rights Front with 2020 Meany-Kirkland Human Rights Award,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-presents-hong-kongs-civil-human-rights-front-2020-meany-kirkland-human-rights-award,6-30-2020,"2020 has been a year of massive and sustained worldwide protests defending democracy and human rights. In Chile, Colombia, Haiti, Lebanon, India, Zimbabwe and the United States, people have taken to the streets. To demand accountability for people in positions of power. To reform unjust systems. To change the course of history. It’s been powerful to witness.And as we just heard from our panelists, the Hong Kong democracy movement and its leading coalition, the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), stands out for its courage and persistence. They have resisted increasing pressure from the Chinese government to cede fundamental rights to speech, assembly and association and to abandon aspirations for democratic governance.In the most recent chapter, Hong Kong’s democracy movement has once again brought together trade unions, students, human rights groups and other civil society organizations. After last June’s incredible million-person rally against legislation that would allow the extradition of Hong Kong citizens to face mainland China’s judicial system, the CHRF has sustained protests through most of this past year. At times, this movement brought 25 percent of Hong Kong's population to the streets at the same time. Talk about power in numbers. Since 2002, the CHRF, working with the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) and many other pro-democracy allies, has been critical in sustaining the call for democracy. And they have paid the price. In October of 2019, the peaceful protests were met by violence when Jimmy Sham, the leader of CHRF who is with us today, was attacked by a group wielding hammers. Despite the attack, CHRF and Mr. Sham remain dedicated to non-violence.This May, Hong Kong’s authorities followed Beijing’s direction. They arrested and charged fifteen activists who organized and led street protests in 2019. Those individuals now face the possibility of long prison sentences. Some—including our union brother and someone who I have had the privilege of knowing for many years, Lee Chueck Yan—have been arrested and charged three separate times in the past couple of months.But these fighters for democracy have been here many times before. They were central to the 2014 “umbrella revolution” that advocated for greater political freedom, including universal suffrage and the ability for Hong Kong to directly elect its chief executive. And we know that the national Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) and local unions are a driving force to the CHRF. As the only autonomous democratic union federation in China, the HKCTU is a leading civil society advocate for democracy. For the rule of law. And for more inclusive economic policies.They play an essential role in promoting participation among low-income residents and raising broad awareness of worker rights. The HKCTU has pushed for laws and policies that enshrine international labor standards—such as a minimum wage—as well as legislation on working hours and collective bargaining rights. With freedom of association as its guiding principle, the HKCTU’s work exemplifies the vital link between the fight for workplace democracy and broad democratic rights. They were at the center of the biggest political conflict in the history of Hong Kong, calling for two general strikes, including the one on August 5, 2019. It brought the city to a standstill.This high participation shows the widespread discontent over the erosion of Hong Kong’s rule of law and fundamental freedoms, and the deep-rooted inequality that has only widened since the 1997 handover. The proposed extradition bill would have further eroded Hong Kong’s sovereignty, and sparked the recent waves of mass action, but the roots of the protests stretch back decades. China has refused to keep promises made to Hong Kong’s people to respect their democratic rights.Today, the central government in Beijing determines who is eligible to lead the local government. Through peaceful protest, the CHRF has called repeatedly for changes to this rigged election system. The government’s response has been harsh. Nearly 9,000 arrests. Tens of thousands of rounds of tear gas used. And restrictions on the right to protest. But none of that prevented massive participation and growing public support. While the government withdrew the extradition bill, there is little sign that it will consider the protesters’ five major democratic demands. Hundreds of working people have been reprimanded or fired by their employers for expressing political views. To protect working people from being punished and to build a more organized base to sustain the pro-democracy movement, thousands of people have joined new unions that represent civil servants, hotel staff, theater professionals and others. Between June 2019—when the protests began—and March 2020, more than 1,700 applications to establish unions were submitted to the Hong Kong Labor Department. Protesters have also brought their demands to the ballot box. In November 2019, an unprecedented 71 percent of voters turned out for local elections, sending a wave of pro-democracy representatives into positions of power. Protesters and voters have clearly insisted that Hong Kong remain a separate system from mainland China. Nevertheless, China appears poised to end the “One Country, Two Systems” framework guaranteed in the 1997 Basic Law.In May, the Chinese central government voted to directly impose a national security law on Hong Kong, bypassing the Hong Kong legislature. We just learned that it will go into effect tomorrow.  The move will make protests and criticism of the Chinese government a serious crime, carrying stiff sentences.  Collusion with foreign forces will also violate the law. The details of exactly what this will mean are still emerging. We do know that the courageous representatives who are with us today are on the frontlines of testing this new law and could face enormous consequences. The elimination of Hong Kong’s civil society and autonomous trade unions would now be easier to impose from Beijing.For over a year now, the CHRF has been on the frontlines, facing the greatest threat yet to Hong Kong’s civil society and democracy over the past twenty years. The AFL-CIO recognizes and honors the sacrifices, bravery and courage demonstrated by all of the participants who are with us today and the people of Hong Kong in the pursuit of democracy and fundamental liberties. Unions and our allies are key to building and sustaining a robust democracy. Courageous leaders like the ones who are with us today from CHRF inspire us with their courage and dedication. That is why we are honoring the Civil Human Rights Front and associated member organizations with the 2020 George Meany-Lane Kirkland Human Rights Award. But this award is about more than recognition. As a federation, we join you in solidarity as you fight to create a world that upholds the tenants of freedom, justice, equality and dignity for all. We stand in solidarity with you tomorrow as you take to the streets peacefully tomorrow.And the AFL-CIO renews our call for the government of Hong Kong to immediately drop the charges against the 15 democracy activists who have been criminally charged for their participation in peaceful protests in 2019. We also strongly oppose the imposition of the national security law. The government must refrain from charging others for their participation in these demonstrations. This award represents our steadfast commitment to every movement around the world committed to advancing the pursuit of democracy and fundamental liberties. Each of these movements has been made stronger by the heroic actions and perseverance of working people in Hong Kong. Thank you and congratulations.

146,Trumka: Black Lives Matter,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-black-lives-matter,6-3-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks in the wake of George Floyd's murder and the national protests that have followed:Our nation woke up this morning in profound pain. Just as we did yesterday and the day before.Pain from a pandemic that has torn through our country, through our workplaces, through tens of thousands of our families.Pain from an economic crisis that has cost tens of millions of workers our jobs.Pain from deeply rooted racial injustice. Injustice baked into our workplaces, our schools and our criminal justice system.These catastrophes are not coincidences. These crises are connected. They cannot be separated or dealt with individually. The coronavirus exploits the health consequences of systemic racism, and the virus rips apart the economy. In turn, mass unemployment adds to and is channeled through racial inequality.  These devastating, dangerous challenges are intertwined. But guess what: so are we.We are here today to say as a labor movement that our country must come together to fight these three crises. To stand in solidarity with those whose lives have been so horribly changed by them—not just in this tragic week, not just in this tragic spring, but over years and decades and generations.We are all connected, so let us speak the names of the lost. The names of victims whose killers must be brought to justice. Those killers include the officers who didn’t protect or serve, but pulled a trigger and pressed a knee into a man’s neck.The killers include a system of racial oppression that is as old as our country and as new as President Trump’s latest tweet.So let us speak their names.George Floyd. Ahmaud Arbery.Breonna Taylor.David McAtee.The names do not stop there. The injustices do not stop with police brutality. The list of victims, the list of grievances, is long.Racism plays an insidious role in the daily lives of all working people of color. This is a labor issue because it is a workplace issue. It is a community issue, and unions are the community. And make no mistake: it is union members on the front lines battling COVID-19 for the communities and the country that we love. We cannot ignore that so many are people of color. So many fallen essential workers were so young. And so brave.  Let us speak their names, too.Kendall Nelson, a member of ATU local 825. A New Jersey Transit bus driver who brought people safely home for 28 years.Detroit Fire Department Captain Franklin D. Williams, Jr. A member of the International Association of Fire Fighters. A man who ran into burning buildings when other people ran out. Karla Dominguez, a 33-year-old pediatric intensive care nurse at Hospitals of Providence Memorial Campus in El Paso. A member of the National Nurses United. She lovingly referred to her child patients as ""her kids."" This week, so many working people said: We have had enough. Enough of the systemic racism.  Enough of the police violence. Many of us took to the streets. In Minneapolis, an entire community rose up in protest, and the labor movement was proudly a part of that rising.  We saw unionized bus drivers refuse to transport protestors to jail.  We saw our labor bodies organize community networks to support peaceful protest. And just yesterday, the Minnesota AFL-CIO rightfully called for the resignation of the Minneapolis police union president—who is inflaming community tensions instead of healing them. Our movement did this because protesting racial brutality—whether at the hands of a police officer or a neighbor or an employer—is not only a righteous cause. It’s a responsibility. It’s incumbent upon each and every one of us. Because as A. Philip Randolph reminded us: “Justice is never given. It is exacted.” And “freedom is never a final fact, but a continuing, evolving process.” So let us say today, with a conviction that is unmistakable, Black Lives Matter.Black. Lives. Matter.But here’s what doesn’t matter: when it comes to your dignity, to your right to live a full life, a life free from fear—it should not matter what your race is. Or how you pray. Or where you were born. Or whether you are documented, what your gender identity is, what your sexual orientation is. None of that matters. We are all children of God.Two years before the historic March on Washington, Dr. King addressed the Fourth Constitutional Convention of the AFL-CIO. He shared that day his dream that “all who work for a living will be one, with no thought of their separateness.”That solidarity is the foundation of the labor movement. In America and around the world.Late Sunday night, as a peaceful protest in front of the White House ended, the AFL-CIO headquarters was sprayed with graffiti. Windows were smashed. And a fire engulfed the lobby.As you can imagine, that was a painful sight to see. In that building where I am so proud to work are artifacts of the courage and dignity of working people throughout the history of our country. A mural of immigrant workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, confronting National Guard bayonets. Photos of autoworkers in the Great Depression, emerging from strikes in triumph. Women workers in the 1970s demanding equal pay. Quilts woven with the names of union members killed on September 11th. My father’s coal lamp is in that building.I visited the house of labor a few hours later. The damage was heartbreaking.  But it was also a reminder: The labor movement is not a museum. It is a living, breathing thing. It is a people linked arm in arm in common purpose. And so on Monday morning, many of those people cleaned up the glass and got back to organizing.Organizing for justice. For a better future. For profound, systematic change. Beneath all three of the connected crises we now face—the coronavirus and mass unemployment and racial injustice—beneath all of them is the question of who gets seen. And who gets heard. And, ultimately, who lives and who dies.A racist society means workers of color are sent into unsafe workplaces by employers and a government that literally does not see them.  A racist society means that millions are left jobless and uninsured when neither needed to happen.But our movement sees you. Our movement fights for you. Our movement raises a fist beside you, kneels next to you, and links arms with you.Where do we go from here? Brothers, sisters and friends, there is no way to uproot what is wrong without profound political change.Yes, we need to throw the divider in chief out of the White House.  But working people need more than that. A return to the socially and economically unjust normal is not acceptable. We need the leaders we elect in their place to use their positions...their power…to dismantle the traditions of oppression in our workplaces, our health system, our housing system, our voting laws, our criminal justice system. The courage, determination and vision that this moment requires demands leadership that sees, that hears, that understands, and that unites. That gives no thought to our separateness but sees us instead as we are: as one.We woke up this morning in pain. Let us turn that pain into resolve. Let us channel our anger and our anguish into action.That is what the labor movement is determined to do.That is how, out of this dark moment, we will win a better day. We will not rest until that day comes. We will not rest until this nation can finally wake up to equality and justice for all.Thank you. May God bless you and keep you safe. © 2023 AFL-CIO.

147,Trumka: COVID-19 and the Symptoms of Structural Discrimination in Our Society,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-covid-19-and-symptoms-structural-discrimination-our-society,5-28-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the following remarks at a town hall on civil rights and COVID-19:

Thank you, Tefere (Gebre) for that introduction, and thank you for leading this town hall. This is an important conversation. Quite frankly, it’s a long overdue one.We often hear people say that the coronavirus doesn’t discriminate. We know that’s far from the truth. It has, and it will continue to. We’ve known for decades that women and minority communities don’t have equal access to health care. These inequities come in many forms. Hospital systems don’t open locations in majority-black communities. If they do, they don’t provide adequate resources. And when it’s time to cut budgets, these locations are the first to go on the chopping block. Women earn less but are expected to work the same hours as men and take care of children more. LGBTQ+ people are treated as second-class citizens, unable to donate blood to help those in need or serve the country they love.This week, our nation is mourning another instance of a deadly encounter between police and an unarmed person of color. George Floyd’s unnecessary death at the hands of Minneapolis police was a preventable tragedy. What happened to George Floyd, what happened to Ahmaud Arbery, has happened for centuries. The difference is now we have cell phones. We can watch what is happening. And we can’t turn our heads and look away because we feel uncomfortable.Racism plays an insidious role in the daily lives of all working people of color. This is a labor issue because it is a workplace issue. It is a community issue, and unions are the community. We must and will continue to fight for reforms in policing and to address issues of racial and economic inequality.Inequities exist. For far too long, we, as a nation, avoided saying that out loud. We avoided doing anything. We can no longer be silent. We can no longer sit still.COVID-19 is shining a light on the inequities that marginalized communities face each day. Black fatality rates from COVID are more than double the rate of white fatalities. It is even worse in communities with large black populations. In Chicago, African Americans make up 30% of the population but 70% of the city’s COVID fatalities. Infections among Native Americans are spiking in urban areas like Salt Lake City, Seattle and San Jose.It is hard to get care in an overcrowded hospital. It is even harder when the nearest hospital is miles away and there are no reliable public transit options. Communities of color are overlooked when there isn’t a public health crisis. That’s unjust, unfair and unsafe. Today, it’s a national tragedy.The health disparities represent one piece of the puzzle. When we take the wider view, we see the domino effect of COVID—and how different communities are affected.When schools are shut down, who takes care of the kids? More often than not, the burden falls on women. That is one reason why the unemployment rate among women is three points higher than the rate among men. When hotels and restaurants close, who loses a job? Overwhelmingly, the answer is people of color. When transit systems remain open, who remains on the front lines? In many cases, African Americans. About 40% of New York City’s transit workers are black, far more than their proportion of the city’s entire population. Meanwhile, nearly 2,500 MTA workers tested positive for COVID-19 and at least 123 people have lost their lives.According to a Pew poll, 61% of Hispanic Americans and 44% of black Americans said that because of COVID-19, they or someone in their home lost a job. COVID-19 is putting a disproportionate amount of people of color at risk. Killing them. Taking away their jobs and income.We know this disparity must be fixed. When the evidence is so overwhelming, we know there are larger issues at play. It isn’t enough for us to make some small fixes while papering over the larger inequities.We must acknowledge that what is happening today is a symptom of structural discrimination in our society. It wasn’t caused by COVID-19, but COVID is making it worse. So much of our focus is on how to beat the virus. What happens after that? Getting back to normal means living in an imbalanced world. We can do better. We must do better.As we identify ways to beat the virus, we should also find ways to be fairer. We can overhaul housing and city planning policies by ending redlining. That will help underserved neighborhoods get access to care. We can fix our infrastructure so public transit is available in every community. We can change paid leave policies so mothers—and yes, fathers, too—can take care of their children.We can either live through history or we can shape it.Structural discrimination exists in red states and blue states. It has festered for generations. We can’t wave a magic wand and get rid of it overnight. But we can acknowledge the harm it causes and the people it hurts. Then we can work to fix it.Let’s use this national moment of problem-solving to solve one of our most pernicious and persistent ones. Let’s root out discrimination and all its consequences. Otherwise, we’ll be having the same conversation during the next crisis.Tefere, back to you.

148,Trumka: Biden a Champion in Every Sense of the Word,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-biden-champion-every-sense-word,5-26-2020,"Below is a transcript of AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka's video message, following the federation's endorsement of Joe Biden for President of the United States:I’m Rich Trumka, and on behalf of the 12.5 million members and 55 unions of the AFL-CIO, we are proud to endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States.We know Joe. And Joe knows us. He’s been to our union halls. He’s marched on our picket lines. He is a champion in every sense of the word. As our unions voted to endorse Joe, I couldn’t help but think back to when I was 12 years old, sitting on my grandfather’s porch in Nemacolin, Pennsylvania. I made a promise to him that night to use my career to help people. About 300 miles northeast in Scranton, Joe was embarking on a similar journey that would eventually take him to our nation’s capital. But D.C. didn’t change him. He changed D.C. As a senator and later, as vice president, Joe used his voice and his vote to advance the cause of working people. He fought for living wages, health care, retirement security and civil rights. He did everything he could to create a fairer process for forming and joining a union. And he never lost his core goodness. Joe’s greatest asset is his character. When he gives us his word, we can take it to the bank. When he tells us he cares, we know it’s true. Joe has overcome unspeakable tragedy in his life. He has buried children. He lost a spouse. And all the while, he has kept going. He has kept serving. And he has never lost faith.Joe Biden is writing a comeback story. And all across America, working people are doing the same. We’ve been knocked down. We’ve been counted out. We’ve been told our time is up. But in the face of corporate greed and political sabotage, we’ve not only survived. We’ve risen. The labor movement has overcome the sustained and vicious attacks of state legislatures, the Supreme Court, the United States Senate and yes, the White House. Gallup puts our approval at 64 percent, a nearly 50-year high. 60 million workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance. We’ve organized and mobilized and gone on strike to win better contracts, better policies and better lives.And we’ve responded to the coronavirus with passion and dedication, even as our federal government falls down on the job.Just imagine what working people can accomplish with an ally in the White House. This endorsement is about working people’s hopes and aspirations. It is an expression of support for Joe Biden. But it is also a clear rejection of our current trajectory. Donald Trump campaigned as a friend of workers, talking about a new direction and a new day after decades of policies that left us poorer and weaker. Some working people, desperate for a rapid departure from business as usual, took a chance on Trump. Look, I get it.And then, over the past four years, the president showed his true colors. He slashed rules designed to protect us on the job and cut workplace health and safety inspectors to their lowest level in history.  He took away overtime pay from millions of workers. At every turn, he has actively undermined collective bargaining and the freedom to form a union. And his response to COVID-19 has been delinquent, delayed, disorganized and deadly.Worse yet, Donald Trump has used the highest office in the land to divide America, scapegoating immigrants, degrading women and playing on people’s worst fears. That’s our choice this year. Between Donald Trump’s pettiness and negativity, and Joe Biden, who is the embodiment of goodness and decency. This is a moment, and an election, for our better angels. Working people have overcome the politics of inaction and hostility. We have confronted our fiercest bullies and made it through to the other side. Joe Biden has done the same.Now is the perfect time to join forces on behalf of the country we love. The path to the presidency runs through the labor movement. And with the full force and unmatched reach of our political program, we are ready to pave that road for our friend Joe Biden. Thank you.

149,Trumka: We'll Either Have a Just Transition or No Transition at All,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-well-either-have-just-transition-or-no-transition-all,5-20-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the 2020 Ceres Global Investor Summit:Thank you Reverend [Kirsten] Spalding, I’m pleased to be with you and Ceres today, and of course also to be here with Torben [Pedersen] and Pension Denmark, which is investing Danish workers’ capital in good jobs and clean energy in Denmark, here in the U.S. and around the world. More about that in a moment. And thank you to all those who are joining online today.This is certainly different than what I expected when I agreed back in January to join Ceres once again for the Global Investor Summit. So before I turn to climate I want to say a word or two about what we can learn from the coronavirus crisis. Our response to the coronavirus has already reshaped our society. It is easy to think the virus is the cause of these changes. But that would be a mistake. The virus simply does what it does. Human beings are the ones making the decisions that shape our societies and our lives, and it is human beings, and human institutions, who will either lead us through this crisis to a better day, or find in the virus the excuse to unleash our own fear, our own greed, our own capacity for hatred.Consider what this has meant for workers. The global labor movement has been engaged in an unceasing struggle since the virus first appeared to see that working people have the equipment, the safety protocols, and most of all the power, dignity and voice we need to keep workplaces safe for everyone. Yet, despite our efforts, too many workers in critical sectors still don’t have adequate personal protective equipment, access to testing, or paid sick days—risking exposure for themselves and their families every time they go to work. Or they can risk their family’s economic security by staying home to avoid exposure. This is unacceptable, and it has to stop.In the context of the coronavirus crisis, that starts with the common sense measures needed to hold our economy together that are in the HEROES Act passed by the U.S. House last week, including the critical mandatory workplace safety standard for infectious disease. For working people, the injustices of the coronavirus crisis are nothing new. In the United States, the lived experience of workers for the past 40 years is that most big changes in the economy result in harm to workers and our communities. Trade agreements that protect investor rights but not worker rights. Outsourcing. Deregulation. Wages that lagged productivity for decades, while inequality soared and the cost of health care and education skyrocketed.Climate change and our response to it can either accelerate this trajectory or take us in a newer, better direction. Rising temperatures threaten the material foundations of our civilization, but also pose enormous challenges to an economy formed on our sourcing and consumption of fossil fuels. We think of coal miners and refinery workers, but the real carbon job footprint includes the railroads, trucks and barges that haul oil and coal, the manufacturing supply chains that produce everything from delicate valves to huge mining trucks that extract fossil fuel. The auto workers that make internal combustion drive trains. We are talking about millions of largely good paying jobs, with benefits and a secure retirement, distributed throughout the United States. And these jobs didn’t get to be life-sustaining careers by accident or the laws of economics.I come from a coal mining family. When my immigrant grandparents went into the mines in the 1920s, a coal miner’s shovel was a ticket to hunger, disease and an early death. When I went into the mines in the 1970s, we had strong unions with powerful safety committees, wages that paid for houses and college educations, including mine, as well as pensions and health care. But my family’s health and economic security was paid for in blood—our blood, at the hands of the Pennsylvania Coal and Iron Police, and the mine owners, their dangerous mines and Black Lung disease. They, like so many employers today in the coronavirus crisis, saw our health as a cost they could not afford. And the same is true for oil workers and railroad workers and auto workers and utility workers.Working people made jobs in the carbon economy into good jobs. We fought for every dollar, for every health benefit, for every safety device and rule. And we powered this nation in the process. If we treat the challenge of moving to a low carbon energy sector as though it is a matter for experts, not for workers, if we act as if a minimum wage job or a staffing agency job is the same as a job that pays middle-class wages with benefits, if our response looks like the past 40 years, with job quality declining in the energy sector as it has in so many other sectors, then of course we can expect—indeed we will create—intense opposition to action on climate change.To prevent that, we must create a politics of hope. Remember, NAFTA went into effect in 1994. Resistance to it reverberates in our politics to this day. Without hope, our politics are in stalemate, and we cannot make progress fast enough. Not on COVID-19, not on fixing our economy, not on reversing inequality, not on fighting racism and not on climate. We need to understand that the true enemies of effective action on climate change are not the workers in the carbon sector, but those who would force them to bear the economic costs of change. Those who offer in exchange for good jobs with real benefits, poorly-paid jobs with few benefits and no future. Those who would seek to combine 21st century technologies with 19th century labor practices. Those like Elon Musk who think that because they make electric cars for rich people they can violate social distancing orders and endanger not just their workers but the entire community in which they do business.But we know it can be different, if we make the right choices. That’s why the AFL-CIO recently entered into the Labor Energy Partnership with former Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz. We will work with Secretary Moniz to develop policies that advance our climate goals and create good jobs, to create hope that the fight against climate can be a win for workers.This work to lay a politically and economically viable foundation for the transition to a clean economy must go on even as we fight the coronavirus. We have no time to waste. And we need the help of the global investor community to succeed. We want a real spirit of partnership between government, investors, workers and operating businesses—the kind of partnership that our hosts at CERES have always championed. We can work together for a policy framework that supports clean energy and high-quality jobs where workers have the ability to collectively bargain.Let me give you an example. Last year, I joined Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon at the Capitol to help him introduce “The Good Jobs for 21st Century Energy Act,” which ties an investment tax credit for renewable energy to labor standards. This legislation has wide support. Several energy unions. The National Wildlife Federation. The BlueGreen Alliance. Data for Progress. That is the kind of broad coalition that can make real headway on these issues.This idea deserves investor support. We must make clear by example that everyone will benefit from fighting climate change. Because the lesson in what has happened globally since the Paris Agreement was signed is that there will be a just transition to a low carbon economy or there won’t be a transition at all. And of course a just transition must be global, just as the atmosphere itself is global.That can only happen if we rebuild our multilateral institutions, starting with the Paris Accord itself. The AFL-CIO supported the Paris Agreement, and we believe the U.S. must stay in it. But there is no way to have a real global solution to climate until the principles of just transition are not just words in a climate treaty, but reality across the multilateral system.In the United States, the labor movement believes the offshore wind sector can be an example of how to create well paid, community sustaining jobs. We are putting that belief to the test on the East Coast right now. We’re hopeful that offshore wind projects from Maine to North Carolina will create hundreds of thousands of good jobs from the manufacturing supply chain to maritime and construction jobs to operations. And the labor movement is ready not just to negotiate the terms of these jobs but to train the skilled workers that the project sponsors will need.The labor movement trains more workers than any institution in the U.S. other than the military. Our training and apprenticeship programs already train workers in the specialized skills needed for offshore wind, and we can meet the need of this vast and critically important project. I personally believe that East Coast offshore wind can be the turning point of the fight against climate change in the U.S., not because of the huge amount of carbon-neutral electric power it will generate, and it will be huge, but because of the potential for a new and truly viable workplace model I believe we can create together—a model that can be the stable political and economic foundation of the great transformation we must make to a low carbon economy.We are encouraged by the pledges to this vision that renewable energy project developers have made in consultation with our partners at the International Trade Union Confederation, the B-Team, CERES and others. This pledge has been signed by leading offshore developers and includes the following commitments “in our operations and in procurement from contractors:”Last year, I asked AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler, who comes out of the power sector herself, to coordinate our work in this area, and to work with our building trades and manufacturing unions to build the relationships we need to make this vision more than words on paper. With the help of the Danish and Norwegian labor movements, and the particular support of the Danish government, we believe we are making real progress. One of our partners in this work is Pension Denmark, so I am eager to hear our friend Torben’s reflections on this critical work.Let me conclude with this. My friends, we can see now that the forces of authoritarianism are in a dance of death with science deniers. But it isn’t just the economy or our ecology that is in peril of further damage. It is our democracy. The same people that want to deny climate science are seizing on the coronavirus crisis as another opportunity to sow division and hatred, and to undermine the public’s faith in science and in the institutions of democratic government.To fight both the coronavirus and climate change we need to address the deficit that threatens global society. And by that I mean not fiscal deficits. I mean the deficit of social solidarity that neoliberalism has fed for decades. In the coronavirus crisis, millions of people have sacrificed their jobs, their incomes and their health to save the lives of people they will never meet.Working people’s sense of social solidarity is undiminished. To fight climate change the critical actors—the investor community, the leaders of multilateral institutions, tech entrepreneurs—must show the kind of solidarity that grocery workers and nurses have shown in these past terrible weeks. And I believe that if the everyday worker can show such solidarity and courage, then so can all of us. Thank you.

150,Trumka on the Unemployment Crisis and the Practical Solutions to Support Workers,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-unemployment-crisis-and-practical-solutions-support-workers,5-7-2020,"Good afternoon. And thank you for tuning in. I am Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. We’re 12.5 million members proud and 55 unions strong.I grew up in a coal town in southwestern Pennsylvania. Losing a job was something my parents feared, our neighbors feared, our entire community feared. Today, that fear has become reality for tens of millions of people across the country. The coronavirus crisis has torn through our nation. It’s turned our world upside down.It didn't have to be this way. Years of weakening our public health system and months of ignoring warnings have left us here. As the death toll continues to climb, as hospitals are being pushed to the brink, as workers sacrifice and serve on the frontlines, we can’t forget that millions of hard-working people have been forced to the sidelines. Out of work through no fault of your own. Before COVID-19 hit, seven million of you were already unemployed. In just the past seven weeks, over 33 million more of you have lost a job. Studies show that for every 10 people who successfully file for unemployment, another three or four can’t get through. And two more don’t even try. So it’s likely that 50 million people are currently out of a job. That’s a quarter of the workforce.If we don’t act, we’ll be inviting a second Great Depression. Working people will suffer in a way we haven't seen in our lifetime. Our economy will come apart. Because nothing works when we aren't working. Already, more than twelve million of you have lost your health insurance when you lost your jobs. Tens of millions more could be next. And many of you who are suddenly uninsured won’t qualify for existing programs like Medicaid. Think about that. Losing health care in the middle of a recession is bad enough. But in the middle of a global pandemic with no end in sight? It’s criminal. We have to do something.Let’s learn the lessons of the past decade. Let’s learn the lessons from just this past month. We know what doesn’t work. There are people in Congress who think the solution is to let cities and states collapse under the pressure of the virus. But the Great Recession taught us that cutting state and local budgets isn’t the answer. Despite what Mitch McConnell thinks, letting state and local governments go bankrupt is not a solution – it’s a scam. Forcing first responders, teachers and other public service workers into unemployment is a drag on our economy. And because of the vital work they do, it’s a danger to all of us. How on earth will we beat this virus without them?We should also learn a lesson from the first chapter of this current crisis: health and safety must come first. Let's remember why we all shut everything down in the first place: to give our overburdened health care system time and space to help those who need it, and to keep new cases to a minimum. If we open before we’re ready, if we open because we’re impatient, if we send our workers into unsafe workplaces and send consumers into unsafe communities, we will not be reopening a healthy economy. We will be reopening an economic wound. And we will make it that much harder to heal down the road. Impatience and imprudence will create a catastrophe of sickness, joblessness and economic collapse. We can see the iceberg coming. Now is our chance to steer out of the way.There are a lot of terrible words to describe what is happening: the worst, the hardest, the deadliest, and so on. But this is not a time for hyperbole. It’s a time for humanity.Behind America’s tragic unemployment numbers are real people. People like Suzie Wilson, a member of UNITE HERE from Philadelphia. For 20 years she worked as a housekeeper and cook. Every morning, she woke up at 5:15 and took two buses to make her 7 a.m. shift as a restaurant prep cook. Suzie has worked all her life. She’s been chasing the idea of a better life. She’s done everything asked of her. And then, one morning in March, she woke up with no job and no health care. Instead of being protected by a safety net, she’s caught in credit card debt, racking up fees just to afford food until she can get some unemployment support. Suzie didn’t do anything wrong. Why are we treating her, and the millions like her, this way?And what about Shirley Thomas, an AFSCME member in Florida? She’s been a public-school custodian for over 19 years. This whole time, her motivation has stayed the same: she loves being around students. She treats them like her own, with care and love. She took pride in keeping the classrooms, bathrooms and cafeteria clean so her students could keep on learning and growing. Last month, school was canceled and she was furloughed. There is no telling when or if she will get to go back to work. That has had a dangerous ripple effect. After all, Shirley is the head of her household. She’s not the only one who depends on that paycheck. It provides for her two daughters, her sister and her brother, who is recovering from a stroke. Without income, Shirley doesn’t know how she’ll be able to gas up the car and take her brother to the doctor. She’s also making personal sacrifices that are unfathomable. That none of us would want to make. That no one in this country should ever have to make. Shirley is diabetic. Without health care, her medications are so expensive that she’s rationing what she has left. She’s even canceled a procedure to remove a blood clot. Here’s how Shirley put it: “My job gave me stability to take care of my kids. It gave me stability knowing that I would be able to retire. Overnight that stability is gone, but I will continue to live by prayer.”Shirley, we’re praying for you. But we’re also fighting for you. Nobody should be living by a prayer or hanging by a thread. Where is our sense of solidarity for Shirley and Suzie and the millions who have lost a job?These days will likely be the greatest test of our lifetime. So I want to call on us, the employed and the jobless, the insured and the uninsured, those suffering at home and those risking everything on the frontlines, to come together as one. One family. One nation. One purpose.If we don’t look out for our neighbors, we all fail. We all suffer. And we cannot expect to recover. If we continue on this current path, if we get impatient, if we think enough has been done already, we will soon pass a point of no return.Our federal government, our Congress must act – swiftly, boldly and if necessary, electronically.Here’s my message to Congress: You have two main jobs right now – keep people on payrolls and keep people safe and alive. End the pandemic politics – now.Don’t tell us this is about the national debt. We are worried about our lives and livelihoods.Don’t tell us we should wait a little longer for unemployment benefits we earned or health insurance we deserve. We have waited long enough. Don’t tell us we should sacrifice our pension. We earned that.Don’t tell us states should go bankrupt or that federal relief is a blue state bailout. We are all vulnerable.Here is the good news: there are practical solutions on the table. We can use federal funding to keep people employed and guarantee everyone’s paycheck for the duration of the crisis. This concept is neither new nor radical. It’s been done before. Employers that have to lay off workers or shut down can certify their payrolls to the federal government. The government pays for the employer to pay their employees. No money goes to CEOs or to Wall Street — just to workers.Payroll support has been endorsed across the political spectrum, from Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri to Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. It’s supported by Alabama’s Doug Jones and Vermont’s Bernie Sanders. And it’s gaining traction among both business and labor. Yes, we must work out the details. But that’s what governing is. What better time to put aside party labels and do what is necessary to keep America whole?Trust me, every worker would rather receive a paycheck than an unemployment check. But that’s not all we want. Our jobs are a source of dignity. A piece of our pride. We are ready to get back to work. We are ready to rebuild America – a nation built by unions. We’ve made this country better, and we’re going to do it again.We are not holding out hope for a return to normal. Workers know “normal” wasn’t working for us. COVID-19 exposed the cracks already in our system. Now, now is our moment. To do more. To be more. To expect more.We all need to stand together.Whether you have a job or you are out of work. Whether you are in a union or not.America’s labor movement is ready to do the hard work of winning a better day.May God shed His grace on the sick and the suffering. And may God bless you. Thank you.

151,Trumka on Fighting Inequalities Exposed by COVID-19 to the OECD and the Business for Inclusive Growth Coalition ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-fighting-inequalities-exposed-covid-19-oecd-and-business-inclusive-growth-coalition,5-6-2020,"Thank you. Let me begin with a word of gratitude about the OECD and the importance of international coordination in this terrible crisis. It’s important to have both good comparative data and strong international leadership. So I want to express my personal appreciation to Gabriela [Ramos] and to Secretary General Gurria for all you and your staff have done in this crisis. Finally, let me thank Marie-Ange Debon for your leadership of the Business for Inclusive Growth Initiative.The global coronavirus crisis is simultaneously the worst health crisis and the worst economic crisis since the Second World War. In a sense it is no one’s fault. The disease is a product of natural forces. Unlike the reckless and exploitative financial practices that led to the 2008 crash, it is not something someone did. But the vulnerability of global society to a pandemic, the vulnerability of the United States and the vulnerability of the poorest countries and the poorest people to a pandemic—these things are very much the consequence of human action. And the consequences of public policy decisions. Now we see the full cost, much like a person who doesn't pay fire insurance premiums doesn't see the cost of what he has been doing until there is a fire.We now face immediate and extremely serious challenges.The first challenge is the challenge of simply getting the coronavirus under control, and protecting the lives and health of working people.The second challenge is emergency economic relief—or the steps that must be taken to minimize the economic damage of the steps we must take to get the virus under control. And here again, we see around the world more and less effective approaches. We see areas in dire need of immediate action, such as the global garment industry, where the companies controlling supply chains that employ millions in the developing world have been reluctant to take any responsibility for what happens to their workers. It’s utterly unacceptable.The third challenge is truthfully where global leadership failed in 2008—and where we simply cannot fail again. This is the challenge of putting in place policies that drive growth and increase incomes after the initial shock we are living through. The policies that lead to the job creating investments in 21st century technology that we need to see around the world to make us more resistant to future pandemics. To address climate change. And to reach the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals.I will say bluntly—if instead of adopting expansionary policies in the months to come we see a revival of austerity economics—I fear for the survival of democracy. And I fear for the very idea of an international economic and political order.We must meet all three of these challenges successfully or the consequence of the coronavirus crisis will be massive unnecessary loss of life and a global depression. The social and political consequences are both unpredictable and unthinkable. There is a statistic that gives a sense of the scale of what is happening in the global labor market. The latest ILO report estimates that global working hours in the second quarter are expected to be 10.5 percent lower than in the last pre-crisis quarter. This is equivalent to 365 million full-time jobs based on a 48 hour work week. Behind that statistic is both widespread devastation in sectors like retail, hospitality and entertainment—and consequent rises in unemployment.Like the disease itself, unemployment has disproportionately fallen on the most vulnerable. Contingent workers, migrant workers, women workers, and workers already facing ethnic, religious and racial discrimination. There is a deep sense in which what we are seeing now in the spread and economic impact of the coronavirus is the wages of inequality. It is the consequences of the long term neoliberal attack on social solidarity and public institutions, and recent right-wing authoritarian attacks on the idea of international cooperation. This is because essential public health measures simply cannot be done within the ideology of market fundamentalism.In this sense fighting the coronavirus is like fighting a war. It requires social solidarity, collective action and planning. At the same time, we can see what works:Social dialogue works. Countries with some of the strongest systems of social dialogue have shown that they can come up with creative solutions that successfully address the most important economic challenge. They are maintaining workers’ income and holding businesses together in the face of revenue collapse. We have seen countries like New Zealand that moved in a more neoliberal direction returning to principles of social dialogue and social solidarity. They are showing positive results in terms of both containing the disease and mitigating the economic impact of the shutdowns necessary to fight the disease.Joint action by business and labor works. At the global level, the pandemic has created space for some joint work between the International Trade Union Confederation and the International Chamber of Commerce. Together, we have advocated for debt relief and for a coordinated action on public health and reconstruction plans dedicated to uplifting the lives of working people.Large-scale, targeted, active labor market policy works. Countries that have put in place comprehensive payroll support programs like Denmark, the U.K. and Canada—or have used short time unemployment systems like Germany—have seen unemployment kept within manageable levels. The U.S. approach of general stimulus and funding for employers with weak employment conditionality has led to Great Depression levels of job loss. This type of direct payroll support must be combined with active labor market policies to help those who still lose jobs toward needed tasks like tracking the disease, shoring up front line workers in healthcare and the food production and distribution system.Finally, international cooperation works. We have seen unprecedented international cooperation among scientists in pursuit of treatments and a vaccine. Cooperation that is responsible for a sense that meaningful medical relief is a matter of months—and not years—away. We have also seen international cooperation among central banks that has so far prevented the collapse of financial markets.But, tragically, that kind of cooperation has been absent in so many other areas—ranging from the production and distribution of PPE, where the law of the jungle seems to prevail. To the treatment of vulnerable migrants and refugees. To the policing of supply chain practices by the world’s largest businesses.And this brings me to the work of the Business for Inclusive Growth coalition. This work obviously began before the coronavirus crisis. The Trade Union Advisory Committee and the global labor movement have strongly supported the coalition’s agenda of mobilizing business groups to address income inequality and embed living wages. But the importance of this work has grown enormously as a result of the coronavirus crisis. Because we are going to face a decision of enormous consequence as a global society as we emerge from this crisis. Will we continue down the path that has made this crisis so deadly and destructive, or we rebuild based on an economic order built on social solidarity. Rising wages, increasing economic security and giving voice to working people.Almost a decade ago, the world’s leaders, through the U.N., endorsed the call for Universal Social Protection. Today, 55% of people have no access to social protection. Another 20% have little coverage of essential services or income measures central to the promised social protection floors in the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals. In developed countries this is a matter of making good policy choices and undoing the self perpetuating political economy of inequality. But it is not an issue of resources.But in the developing world in the face of the coronavirus crisis we must show international solidarity. This is why the global labor movement is calling for the creation of a Global Social Protection Fund, which would require less than $5 billion a year in the 28 poorest countries and from the U.S., $25 billion a year for partial support for low- to middle-income countries according to need. We thank the OECD, the E.U. and other governments for supporting this plan. I look forward to working with you to making it a reality.In a similar vein, thanks to decades of work at the OECD, we have important tools that should be used to address the consequences of coronavirus for supply chain workers and their communities. The OECD’s Multinational Enterprise Guidelines should be enforced to ensure that multinational employers pay their suppliers and maintain income and social protections for the supply chain workers from Honduras, to Bangladesh to Cambodia that have created so much wealth for them. The recently signed Call to Action between the International Organization of Employers and the ITUC is a first step to recognizing the need to maintain the income of the 150 million supply-chain workers in the garment industry. For the work of the OECD, there should be an expectation of all Business for Inclusive Growth coalition members that they take active steps to mitigate the risk for violation of the OECD Guidelines. That they commit to constructive dialogue and not reject offers for mediation to peacefully resolve specific problems with respect to these guidelines.And more broadly, let us work together to embed the things we are learning in this crisis in the economic life of the global economy and in the way we structure our trade policies and our systems of market regulation. Because we can't fight a global pandemic with public institutions crippled by tax evasion. We can't fight a global pandemic when we have a small number of firms controlling inordinate shares of output. Nor can we excuse trade rules that ignore the risks of such high levels of concentration in either a few firms or a few production locations.We can't fight a global pandemic when workers are voiceless and powerless in unsafe workplaces that are effective super-spreaders of disease.We can’t fight a global pandemic when workers don't have paid sick days. We can't stop a global recession without setting real living wage standards globally.We can't stop a global recession when work has been made precarious and millions of workers in both developed and developing countries are excluded from social protections.And we can't manage a global economy without structures for workers and employers at every link in supply chains to work together to manage the human and economic consequences of disruption.On behalf of the Trade Union Advisory Council to the OECD, let me say that we are really pleased that global business is engaging with the OECD—and with each other through the B4IG initiative. We are committing ourselves to dialogue with you and developing a space of common cooperation in the midst of this global pandemic. Thank you and I look forward to questions.

152,Trumka: Working People’s Plan for Reopening the Economy the Right Way,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-working-peoples-plan-reopening-economy-right-way,4-21-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks on a call with reporters: Good morning. Thank you for joining this call. Right now, amid this global pandemic, it is difficult to see clearly. But this country is finally starting to see workers. America sees the grocery store worker restocking the shelves so we have meals. We see the teacher who is going above and beyond so our children continue to grow. We see the nurse who is being pushed to their limit to save lives. We see the unemployed worker who is out of a job through no fault of their own. And we see the workers who have lost their lives to coronavirus.The AFL-CIO proudly represents over 12.5 million of these workers across 55 unions. While each union represents different workers in different industries, we stand together as one. Our greatest statement of solidarity is how we move forward and begin to heal. Heal in the wake of personal loss. Heal our communities, which have been pushed to the brink. Heal our country.Right now, the narrative has shifted to reopening the economy. And I get it. People are looking for a light at the end of the tunnel. A sense of resolution. A return to normal—whatever that may look like.Now more than ever, we have a responsibility to speak with honesty and act with urgency. We must do what the federal government has refused to: protect America’s workers. Hundreds of thousands of workers have been infected with coronavirus. Thousands have died. Instead of following the advice of worker safety and health experts, President Trump made this crisis worse. Instead of science, he’s chosen politics. Instead of unity, he’s chosen division. And now he wants us to trust him with our lives and livelihoods? No. Too much is at stake. That is why I believe…and why workers believe…the greatest mistake we can make is reopening the economy too soon. Too many people, including President Trump, are asking: when? That is the wrong question. We need to be asking: how? A rush to open without the proper protections for workers will lead to an explosion of the disease, many more deaths and another shutdown. It is a surefire way to increase the death count and plunge our economy into a second Great Depression. There is no room for error. Not one inch. We have to get this right.Workers have been on the frontlines of this battle. We’ve given our sweat and blood. We’ve lost our jobs. We’ve given our lives. It is time to listen to us. We must put safety first. Here are our demands.First and foremost, workers must have a say in these decisions. A say in every workplace. A say across every industry. A say at every level of government—city, state and federal. Workers believe any decision must be based on worker safety and sound science. Any interference from politics and profits puts us in grave danger.Workers need strong, clear and enforceable workplace health and safety standards. Later today, House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott will introduce legislation requiring the Department of Labor to issue an emergency workplace infectious disease standard. The one President Trump scrapped when taking office. This standard would require employers that are currently open or plan to reopen to develop and implement an infection control plan. And let me be clear, if this standard had been in place when COVID-19 hit, far fewer people would have died.Workers also deserve stronger protection against retaliation. We must have the right to refuse to work if we fear exposure to the virus. Just look at Amazon. Chris Smalls was fired for exposing the dangerous conditions he and his co-workers had to endure. Two more employees were fired for doing the same thing. And let’s call it like it is: Amazon is not alone. What kind of culture does this create? For workers, it sends the message that silence is more important than safety. That is morally and economically reprehensible. And we must stop it.Next, workers on the job and those returning to the job need a massive increase in personal protective equipment—or PPE. For example, reusable respirators that provide higher levels of respiratory protection than disposable N95 respirators must be available for workers with the greatest exposures. There is no excuse for not having enough equipment. The president invoked the Defense Protection Act, but he has failed to use it in any coherent manner. Workers are ready to support each other. We are ready to build more PPE. We are ready to prioritize the places that need it most.Next, workers require a massive increase of rapid and reliable coronavirus testing. This should go without saying. Widespread testing is indispensable in order to assess the threat to public health before lifting preventive measures. If you look at the president’s plan, it excludes benchmarks for testing. It’s unacceptable. Testing must be fast, free, accessible and everywhere. Right now, we are nowhere close to that benchmark. We are also calling for the federal government to oversee a system of recording, reporting and tracking worker infections. There must be a presumption that COVID-19 is a work-recordable illness for all workers. There must be real-time reporting of infections from the workplace to state and local health departments.And finally, workers demand that employers must trace the contacts of infected workers and remove exposed workers from work with pay and without retaliation. If we are potentially exposed, we must be informed and appropriately removed from the workplace. We need to be protected from loss of income, benefits or employment. And employers must guarantee 14 days of paid sick leave. No questions asked. No caveats.This may seem like a bold plan, but a historic crisis requires a historic response. If we truly believe workers are essential, then these conditions are essential, too.Let’s back our words up with actions. Worker safety, economic recovery and public health are intertwined. Moving too fast or doing too little on one front poses an extreme danger to everyone. That can’t happen. Workers have risen to the occasion throughout this crisis. Now it is time for our government to do the same.Thank you. God bless you. And stay safe.

153,Trumka to Pennsylvania AFL-CIO Convention: This Is a Moment for Solidarity,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-pennsylvania-afl-cio-convention-moment-solidarity,4-6-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks via video conference to the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO Convention:Brothers and sisters, it’s great to be with you tonight. Thank you, Brother Rick [Bloomingdale], for inviting me, and for everything you do. Thank you, Brother Frank [Snyder], for your strength and vigor. I am grateful to both of them for their steadfast leadership but also their friendship. And thank you to the entire Pennsylvania AFL-CIO for your courage in the midst of a crisis.Selfishly, I wish I was back home. I wish I was in Pennsylvania. I wish I was in the same room as you. The coronavirus may keep us apart, but it cannot break our bond or bust our unions! Nothing can, and nothing ever will!This year’s theme—“Solidarity”—could not be more fitting. These are dark and difficult days. Our hearts are filled with anxiety and uncertainty. At times, our faith is downright tested. But solidarity does not happen only when you can reach out and touch your brother or sister. It happens every time we uphold and act upon our shared values—even when…especially when…times are tough.Those values will guide us and help us beat this virus. The grocery store worker who stocks the shelves early in the morning and late at night will help us beat this virus. The firefighters and EMTs who answer the call and run toward danger will help us beat this virus. The nurses at Pennsylvania’s hospitals who are treating an onslaught of patients without personal protective equipment—they will help us beat this virus.And by the way, the labor movement will help get them that equipment, come hell or high water. This state federation is working with businesses, retooling factories and taking care of frontline workers. Look at Majestic Athletic in Easton. They have gone from making athletic jerseys and hats to making personal protective equipment and gowns. That matters. That will save lives. That happened because of you.Brothers and sisters, our strength, our solidarity, our service, will flatten the curve, deliver America to the other side and rebuild this nation in our image. It won’t be easy. We all know that. Coronavirus is the greatest challenge we have faced since the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations merged nearly 65 years ago. And it’s going to get worse before it gets better.Right now, all 67 counties in our commonwealth are shut down. Unemployment claims have skyrocketed to record levels. Economists project that the actual unemployment rate right now is about 13 percent. By comparison, it topped out at 10.2 percent during the financial crisis. Joblessness from the coronavirus is going to look more like the Great Depression than the Great Recession. Construction has come to a screeching halt. Workers are hurting. When I say workers, I’m not only talking about union members but all working people, regardless of if they carry a union card or one day hope to. Solidarity extends to anyone. Perhaps that promise has never been more important.Before this crisis, more than 60 million people were ready to join our ranks if given the chance. Now, that number is growing. Coronavirus has pulled back the curtain on life-changing and in many cases life-saving power of collective action. We are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Chris Smalls, the worker and organizer who planned strikes at Amazon facilities this week. One day later, Amazon fired him. They said it was for employee insubordination, but we knew it was employer retaliation. As is often the case with Jeff Bezos, the rhetoric does not match the reality. A leaked email from his top lawyer exposed the truth. Smalls was fired for calling for better wages, better protections, better equipment. Conditions in Amazon warehouses were a disgrace before coronavirus, and now we’re seeing once again the dangers of corporations that put bottom lines over workers' lives.At Amazon’s fulfillment center in Palmer Township, workers have been informed of multiple employee coronavirus cases this week. Instead of closing the facility and cleaning it, they’re encouraging employees to practice social distancing. It’s shameful. Amazon is proving that corporate America’s moral compass is broken. We can do better. We must do better.Workers remain on the frontlines of this battle. We are still showing up every day and stepping up to do more. We are rising to the moment despite the danger and rising up in solidarity!But workers can’t do it alone. Rick and Frank can work miracles, but they’re not saints. This is a time for real leadership in Washington, D.C. Donald Trump proved long ago that he is bad for workers. And now he’s proving that he can’t handle a crisis. A crisis calls for selflessness. It calls for poise and judgment and vision. The only thing Donald Trump can see is the man in the mirror. Who else would talk about television ratings as people are dying?Donald Trump’s reckless and dangerous deregulation is costing lives. He cancelled President Obama’s workplace standard on infectious diseases. He fired the pandemic response team put together by Presidents Bush and Obama. He’s put the Occupational Safety and Health Administration on a starvation diet and there are now fewer workplace inspectors and health specialists than at any point in history. Only one inspector for every 79,000 workers. At the federal level, the agency has enough inspectors to inspect workplaces only once every 165 years. And he gives himself a 10 out of 10. As our members are dying. I give President Trump a one. As in one term!But we have seen what real leadership looks from some members of Congress, including a 35-year old from the suburbs of Pittsburgh! The political pundits said we couldn’t flip that district. Working people pounded the pavement, knocked on doors and made phone calls. Now Conor Lamb is working for us! And he’s doing a damn good job fighting for the dignity and safety of workers. He’s been picking up PPE, loading it in his truck and delivering it to frontline workers in Pennsylvania. That’s what character looks like. Conor Lamb is looking out for people’s lives instead of looking for a photo-op. Harrisburg and Washington need leaders who have compassion, a conscience and the courage of their convictions. People who don’t pander to us but prove themselves to us.It’s been easy to forget the 2020 election is only a few months away. But this crisis has made clear just how important it is to get that decision right.Brothers and sisters, we are going to win here in Pennsylvania. Conor Lamb was just the beginning. This isn’t a red state or a blue state. It’s a union state! So we’re going to elect our members and allies from the school board to the statehouse to the White House.I have to be honest: I wish Pat Toomey was up this year. After a quarter century of suffering under NAFTA, we poured our blood, sweat and tears into the USMCA negotiations. Last June, we kicked off our trade tour in Pittsburgh and promised to do everything we could to win a better deal. And in December, we won that deal—despite Donald Trump, not because of him. His original proposal was completely unenforceable and would have left us holding the bag for another 25 years. But working with champions like Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Sherrod Brown, we put NAFTA in the dustbin of history. When the bill came up for a vote, Pat Toomey thought it was too worker-friendly and voted against us. Here is a simple rule to live by: If Pat says it’s wrong, it must be right. Pat voted against us. In 2022, we’re going to vote against him.Pat Toomey’s biggest insult to Pennsylvania’s working families is his continued support for Mitch McConnell. The other week, Congress passed the $2 trillion coronavirus relief package. The labor movement boosted unemployment insurance, knowing more and more people will need it in the coming weeks and months. We secured more money for states and cities, hospitals and schools, Amtrak and local transit systems. And for industries receiving major bailouts, like the airlines, we made clear: this money isn’t a golden parachute. It isn’t for stock buy-backs. It’s not for another executive’s vacation house. It is to keep employees on the payroll. But you should have seen the bill Mitch McConnell originally put forward. It was no better than Donald Trump’s original NAFTA rewrite. Nothing more than a corporate power grab.Mitch McConnell and Mitch McConnell alone blocked pension relief. He wants to let our retirement plans go under. Never forget that! He wouldn’t negotiate on paid sick leave. He blocked real relief to the Postal Service. This is what we’re up against. This is why elections matter. Just imagine the progress we can make when we have a White House and a Senate that actually believes in the labor movement.We need to vote for our values. We need to elect candidates who want to build unions, not bust them. And we know where to find them. Our path to power program is working. Pennsylvania is proof. The commonwealth has 27,000 elected officials—the second-most in the nation. Well, 4,000 of those elected officials are card-carrying union members. The labor movement is building a farm team for the future. It’s a future where our rights are protected. Our values help lift everyone up. Our brothers and sisters run for office and run our towns, our commonwealth and our country!Having faith in the future can be tough right now. I get that. Working people have been pushed aside, knocked down and rolled over for 40 years, but we always get back up and lend a hand to the person next to us. No recession or right to work law has defeated us. The rising tide of collective action gives me hope. The droves of young people organizing and unionizing give me hope. Pennsylvania gives me hope.This state federation is working with businesses, retooling factories and taking care of frontline workers. Look at Majestic Athletic in Easton. They have gone from making athletic jerseys and hats to making personal protective equipment and gowns. That matters. That will save lives. That happened because of you. Donald Trump is not giving Pennsylvania the PPE that frontline workers need and deserve. He’s saying it’s a federal stockpile, not a state stockpile. Mr. President, look at this commonwealth. Look at this state federation. Look to us for guidance. Unions are donating their extra PPE to the unions that need it more. To people who are on the frontlines of this pandemic, regardless of affiliation. That is solidarity. You realize that we are our brother’s and sister’s keepers.This incredible generosity reminds me of my childhood in Nemacolin. My mother made pork chops for dinner. We were poor. My dad worked in the mines. So pork chops…that was a big deal. Well, I brought a buddy home. My mother only had four pork chops. One for herself. One for my father. One for my sister. One for me. My mother gave her dinner to my friend. I’ll never forget that. Why? Families make shared sacrifices. Not just for members of our family but for everyone in the community. We are a family. In this time of crisis and confusion, we will care for the sick and restock food. We will power the plant and continue to teach children. We will lift the loads and lift everyone up with us. We never ignore the call, and we’ll do whatever it takes for the commonwealth and country that workers built. And that in the face of this crisis, that they will rebuild.This is a moment for solidarity.This is the moment we were made for.May God give you health and strength.And may God bless the American labor movement.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

154,Trumka: We Will Pass This Test,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-we-will-pass-test,3-19-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following Facebook Live address outlining the labor movement's response to the coronavirus outbreak:My name is Rich Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO.Thank you for tuning in. Thank you for your hundreds of questions. Thank you for keeping this country strong.Leading America’s labor federation is the greatest honor of my life.55 unions proud. 12.5 million members strong. We are the nurse.We are the teacher. We are the firefighter and the grocery store worker.We are the pilot and the flight attendant.We are the steelworker, the autoworker and the mineworker.We are the actor and the stagehand.We are in every state and every community.We are from every background, every race, every religion, every sexual orientation and every gender identity.We are young and old. Public and private sector.We built this country. We serve this country. We are this country. And we are hurting. Hurting for those who are sick. Hurting for those who are scared. Hurting for each other. Hurting for our nation.But even in the face of a public health emergency, a pending economic catastrophe and the utter disruption of life as we know it, working people are showing that no crisis is too great. No task is too tall. No challenge is too daunting.Frontline workers are risking their lives to save others. They are running toward this virus. They are the embodiment of courage. Workers of every stripe are supporting those in need—the sick, the laid off, the isolated, the vulnerable—with money and encouragement and love and solidarity.Our bond cannot be broken. Our spirit cannot be shaken. We will get through this. We will pass this test. The courage of working people shines even brighter when compared to the indifference of our leaders in government. President Trump and his administration were woefully unprepared for this outbreak.Their response has put politics over science and greed over good.Workers—especially those who do not yet have a union—are undeniably less safe because of this president. Over the past three years, he has systematically rolled back workplace protections and cut funding for the programs that keep us safe, healthy and alive. The agency charged with protecting workers—OSHA—is rudderless and still without a full-time director. And today there are fewer workplace inspectors and health specialists than at any point in history.There was a contingency plan for a situation like the one created by the coronavirus. Progress was being made on a permanent infectious disease workplace standard.A strong enforceable standard would have provided employers both the tools and the mandate to protect workers from infection.But President Trump halted it once taking office.This is part of the Trump administration’s pattern of reckless and dangerous deregulation.Instead of strengthening worker protections, President Trump is scrapping them. Lisa, a member of the Ohio Nurses Association, asked me what we can do to encourage more N95 masks to protect frontline workers from exposure?The accounts from nurses like Lisa have been heartbreaking. Stories of nurses making their own masks out of gowns.Clearly, our frontline health care workers don’t have the protective equipment they need to take care of patients. And the government is not being transparent about what is available and how to get it. So we are calling on the administration to specifically put someone in charge to make sure our national stockpile is distributed to those workers in greatest need.I don’t think that’s too much to ask.Because of the administration’s incompetence, a deadly disease may soon give way to a Great Depression if we don’t take dramatic steps to rescue working people from a disaster we did nothing to cause.This cannot be business as usual.First and foremost, we need to solve the public health crisis. Every worker should get 14 paid sick days, no matter where they work and no matter how they are classified.Coronavirus testing and treatment must be free and accessible to all who need it. We must expand our hospital and intensive-care capacity as fast as we can, no matter the cost.Second, while the economy is ground to a halt, we’re going to need the government to step up in a massive way.We need to fix our unemployment insurance system—broaden it to all working people and increase the benefits. We need to get help to every entity that drives our economy: workers, households, businesses, and state and local governments.This is particularly urgent right now in aviation, hospitality, entertainment, construction and education.Michael, an AFT member in New York, asked what message we can send to ensure that the rich and corporations don’t use this public health crisis to further erode the middle and working classes.Michael, you’ve hit the nail on the head. Let me be perfectly clear.If you are a business that gets money to weather the storm, you must use it for the common good.No layoffs, no wage cuts, no benefit cuts, no busting of union contracts.No stock buybacks. No bonuses.No way. No how. No more. These are the conditions we are insisting on.Finally, once we’ve weathered this crisis, we should make the big investments in our country and each other that are long overdue. We should finally rebuild our infrastructure through a massive trillion dollar investment that will put our construction workers back on the job and spur economic growth. And we should pass the PRO Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act because a stronger labor movement means a stronger America. As I conclude, I’ve been thinking a lot about a question I got from Garrett, a member of the National Association of Letter Carriers in Seattle.He wondered if this crisis may be an opportunity for the labor movement to increase the number of union jobs in this country.Garrett, my answer is: YES! YES! YES!I’ve been at this for 50 years.And I’ve never been more optimistic about the future of the labor movement.We’ve endured 9-11 and a Great Recession. We’ve come together in the face of right to work, incomparable corporate greed and now, a deadly disease and a lawless president who is a threat to our lives and livelihoods. And guess what? We’re still standing. The seeds of a union resurgence have been planted in every corner of this country. Our popularity is at a nearly-50-year high.60 million Americans would vote to join a union today if given the chance.Workers are positioned to make the difference in the 2020 election—and we will. Our values—hard work, dignity, respect—are needed more today than ever before. Unions built America. We can protect and care for our people and our families...and we will rebuild America. And I promise you this: there WILL be a better day.God bless you. God protect our frontline workers. God bless the American labor movement.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
155,Trumka Calls for Workplace Standard on Infectious Diseases,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-calls-workplace-standard-infectious-diseases,3-6-2020,"Below are AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka's remarks at today's reporter roundtable, as prepared for delivery: Good morning and thank you all for being here. I hope this is the first of many conversations throughout 2020 about the hopes, aspirations and direct action of working people. This morning, the AFL-CIO and many unions submitted a petition to the U.S. Department of Labor calling for an emergency workplace infectious disease standard in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The reports I’m hearing from our affiliate unions are deeply troubling. Guidance from federal authorities have been inconsistent at best and dangerous at worst. Many employers are woefully unprepared. And the virus continues to spread. There was a contingency plan for this type of situation. Progress was being made on a permanent infectious disease workplace standard. A strong enforceable standard would have provided employers both the tools and the mandate to protect workers from infection.But President Trump halted it once taking office.This is part of the Trump administration’s pattern of reckless and dangerous deregulation. Over the past three years, the president and his team have systematically rolled back workplace protections and cut funding for the programs that keep us safe, healthy and alive. The agency charged with protecting workers—OSHA—is rudderless and still without a full-time director. And today there are fewer workplace inspectors today than at any other point in history. We just learned yesterday, that despite union outcry, the Trump administration is trying to weaken protections for health care workers and first responders. Instead of recommending a minimum of N95 respirators for certain workers at elevated risk, and instead of putting in place other measures that are more effective, the CDC is now claiming a simple face mask is enough for workers who are exposed to infected patients. This change is not based on sound occupational health practice, but shows that hospital associations have an ear in the Trump administration. Further, the shortage of respirators is another reminder that the Trump administration did not prepare for this crisis—and the CDC should know better than to put politics over science. The AFL-CIO—made up of 55 unions and 12.5 million members—including those on the front lines—is working nonstop to empower and protect those in harm’s way. We are coordinating with our affiliate unions to immediately develop and disseminate educational training and logistical resources and recommendations from the foremost experts. We have trained, educated and equipped our members with the tools they need to be safe on the job. We are demanding the CDC provide protective guidance instead of bad advice that leaves workers at risk.Make no mistake, we have the most qualified members on the ground. But we should not have to go it alone. Working people are doing our part in the face of the coronavirus outbreak. Now our government must do the same. An emergency workplace infectious disease standard would be a step in the right direction and set in motion a 6-month timeline to create a long overdue permanent standard so we are better prepared if and when the next outbreak occurs. A protective OSHA standard is even more important now that the Trump administration rolled back CDC-recommended protections, leaving working people at greater risk.The administration’s incompetent response to the coronavirus is the latest example of a system on the brink—working people simply do not believe that our economy or our politics is working for us. We are increasingly skeptical of information, unless it comes from a fellow union member. The most basic tenet of our democracy—voting—remains under attack. There was only one vote center on UCLA’s campus, a university with 40,000 students. Three and four hour wait times were reported. At the center, apparently only 9 machines worked out of 39. Texas closed 750 polling places after the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act. A gentleman named Hervis Rogers waited seven hours to vote at a polling station on the campus of Texas Southern University at Houston. These are just a few examples. Is it any wonder people are fed up?I strongly believe that the 2016 election was an indictment of political elites in both parties that for too long have embraced policies that increase inequality of income, opportunity and power. Donald Trump promised to change the rules and he has, but to whose benefit? More than three years into his administration, it is clear this president only cares about people like himself. Day after day, he’s attacked our wages, our health care, our pension, our safety and our right to form a union—all to further entrench power in the hands of the wealthy elite. He is one of the most anti-worker presidents in my lifetime, and we are looking for something much different in 2020. Clearly, Tuesday was a big night for Joe Biden. Vice President Biden has overcome a lot of adversity in his life. And his comeback in this election is just another example. Our members know Joe well. He is a longtime friend and ally. He also has some explaining to do with our members, especially around the issue of trade. While we congratulate Joe Biden on strong Super Tuesday, this race is far from over. Our presidential forum in Orlando on Thursday could not come at a better time. Workers will have an opportunity to interview Vice President Biden and Senator Sanders directly about the issues that are most important to us. Working people are driving this election process. We are evaluating the candidates. We are asking the tough questions. Our voices must be heard. And our support must be earned. Simply put, we have a long way to go.With that, I am happy to open it up for questions.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
156,Trumka Vows to Fight Attacks on Federal Employee Collective Bargaining,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-vows-fight-attacks-federal-employee-collective-bargaining,2-10-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the AFGE Legislative and Grassroots Mobilization Conference:Thank you, Brother Everett (Kelley). I am proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with you.And I am proud to stand alongside every AFGE member who has fought back against some of the most ferocious and despicable political attacks in our nation’s history. For the past three years, your union has had a bullseye on its back.The Trump administration has attacked your collective bargaining rights. They’ve attacked your members’ due process. They’ve attacked your very right to exist.And just this weekend, we learned of their latest plan to strip collective bargaining from the hard-working Americans who serve our nation at the Department of Defense.In 1962, President John F. Kennedy issued an executive order which said and I quote: “Employees of the federal government shall have and shall be protected in the exercise of...the right...freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal...to form, join and assist any employee organization.” He understood that collective bargaining was an exercise of freedom. He believed that federal employee unions were good for our nation and yes, for our national security. Now Donald Trump wants to retreat from generations of common sense policy for no other reason than he doesn’t like you. Brothers and sisters, we will fight this in the courts. We will fight this in Congress. We will fight this on every front and with every fiber of our being. And I promise you this: we’ll be here long after we send Donald Trump back to his gold-plated mansion. AFGE members are strong. You are powerful. You are devoted. And you are tough as nails. You don’t go into work every day for fame or fortune. You do it for our troops and the support they deserve at the DOD. You do it for our veterans and the care they need at the VA. You do it for our seniors and the Social Security and Medicare they rely on. You do it to carry out your oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.You are federal workers because you are patriots. And YOU DECIDED that there is nothing more American than forming a union. That fundamental right is why we raise our voices. It’s why we organize. It’s why we fight.AFGE has been securing good jobs, dignity and respect for 88 years. During the Great Depression, agency leaders called for furloughs and tried to cut pay for federal workers. In one of the bleakest years of the Depression, America’s civil servants organized and demanded their pay be restored. They said enough was enough. And AFGE was born. That act of boldness and unity was an inspiration for people everywhere, even in those dark times. Private-sector workers looked to their brothers and sisters in the civil service and said, I want what they have. It started a wave of powerful organizing in America.That’s what I want you to remember today: When you fight, you’re not just fighting for the brothers and sisters who share your foxhole. You’re fighting for everybody, everywhere. Your wins lift up everybody, everywhere.When this union stands tall, workers everywhere grow taller. When this union pushes hard, workers everywhere push harder. Your legacy of solidarity has guided you through these painful past few years.Even after the government shutdown…even after the legal letdowns…even after the executive orders aimed at your jugular…AFGE is still going strong.In the budget agreement last year, federal workers won a raise and paid parental leave. Just last week, the House passed the PRO Act on a bipartisan vote, so workers in the private sector can form unions on a level playing field. We’re electing union members to public office from coast to coast and everywhere in between. And I know you are ready to get back to the bargaining table and win even more.This administration has tried to act tough. But the only thing it has proved is that labor can take a punch, dust ourselves off, and keep demanding what’s rightfully ours: collective bargaining, a secure retirement, safe working conditions and fair wages.That’s what we do. Just a few miles away, across the Anacostia River, you can visit the house of Frederick Douglass. As you know, he escaped slavery as a young man and spent the rest of his life fighting for justice and equality. So he knew a little something about standing up and rising up. His legacy is one we should all keep in mind now, during Black History Month.Douglass once said that: “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did, and it never will.”This conference is designed for you to make your demands known to the people in power.Tell them you demand nothing less than dignity and respect at work.Fill up the Hart Senate Office Building tomorrow. Tell your members of Congress to protect your pension and health care. Tell them that you expect their support for the fundamental right to collectively bargain. And tell them you’ll remember in November.I know you may feel tired. But as I look out on this crowd, I see you’re battle-tested.And in a fight between Donald Trump and AFGE, I will take America’s civil servants every day of the week. We will rise, brothers and sisters! And no right-winger or union-buster or government-basher can stop us.As long as we stand up and fight back, as long as we lock arms, as long as we keep demanding better, we will rise. And we will win!God bless you! God bless AFGE! God bless the American labor movement!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
157,Trumka Calls PRO Act 2020's Most Significant Piece of Legislation ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-calls-pro-act-2020s-most-significant-piece-legislation,2-5-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a press conference in support of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act: AFL-CIO President @RichardTrumka joined @SpeakerPelosi and others today at the #PROAct Press Conference. #1u

Hear his remarks here: pic.twitter.com/5sWrSVwqBx
Good afternoon. Thank you, Speaker Pelosi, for your leadership. And thank you, Jennifer (Womack), for your courage. How many of you saw Verizon’s commercial on Super Bowl Sunday? It captured the duty, responsibility and humanity of America’s first responders...a fitting tribute to those who risk their lives for our safety. And while it was a nice reminder about the importance of our connection to each other—it didn’t tell the whole story.When Jennifer and her coworkers tried to form one of the most personal and powerful bonds possible—a union as members of the Communications Workers of America—Verizon said no. You see, 5G might be able to do a lot of exciting things, but it cannot fix our broken and outdated labor laws. At Verizon and elsewhere—in more than 40 percent of all union organizing drives—employers break the law. They lie. They coerce. In some cases, they fire union supporters. Workers are forced to attend mandatory meetings with one item on the agenda: make people afraid to exercise our freedom to form a union. And these messages of fear and intimidation are coming from the very people who control our paychecks, how much time we can spend with our family, whether we will have a job in six months, a year. That’s how you end up with an economy where more than 60 million people would vote to join a union, but only one in ten workers actually have one. Workers want in. Is it any wonder why? Simply put, workers in unions bargain for higher wages and are much more likely to have health care and a pension. The union advantage is even greater for people of color. Unionized workers have a real say in critical workplace issues like time off to care for a loved one, the deployment of technology and protection from discrimination.The National Labor Relations Act—passed in 1935—was a beacon of the New Deal. It ushered in a new era of workers organizing to win equality—our share of the American Dream. That wave of worker voice changed the direction of America and built the greatest middle class the world has ever known. But the NLRA has only been weakened in the 85 years since—and an entire union-busting industry now works nonstop to block workers from exercising the freedom that the law is supposed to protect.  Now is the time—in fact, it’s way past time—to protect the right to organize for workers in the 21st century. The PRO Act is how we do it. It is not an exaggeration to say this is the most significant piece of legislation that will come before the House this year. It protects the right to strike. It trumps the “right to work” sham. It ensures a process for reaching a first contract once a union is recognized, provides substantial relief for workers whose rights have been violated and creates a true deterrent, so employers think twice before violating the law.It also removes the employer’s standing in representation cases. The choice to form a union must belong to Jennifer and her coworkers, not Verizon and its executives. So we call on the House to pass the PRO Act. We call on all members of Congress—Republican and Democrat—to support it. We call on the Senate to follow suit. And we call on President Trump to sign this bill into law. And to those who would oppose, delay or derail this legislation—do not ask the labor movement for a dollar or a door knock. We won’t be coming. Stand with us today. And we’ll stand with you tomorrow.Jennifer deserves nothing less. America’s workers deserve nothing less. Thank you very much.

158,Trumka: Immigration Is About Coming Together,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-immigration-about-coming-together,2-4-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at hearing on immigrant worker rights:Good morning and thank you for being here. It is good to see so many unions represented in this room.At our 2017 convention, delegates unanimously adopted Resolution 22, committing us to build community trust, which said and I quote: “Politicians attempting to distract from the real issues facing our nation have elevated efforts to criminalize and target immigrants to a level that puts our core democratic values and institutions at risk.”Those efforts are ongoing. And those risks are growing more serious. Look at what happened in just the past seven days.First, the Supreme Court let the White House get away with its public charge policy, which some call a wealth test, because it allows America to close our doors to legal immigrants who may not be high-earners. That’s a direct attack on working-class people—and would fundamentally change America’s primarily family-based immigration system to one that grants preference to the wealthy and privileged.Then the Trump administration expanded its travel ban to six more countries, blocking one out of four people on the African continent from coming here, and turning away people from Myanmar—where countless refugees are seeking safety.On top of all of this, two more people who came to our border to request asylum died in custody.That’s only one week’s worth of news. Election Day is still 10 months away.Brothers and sisters, immigration is going to be part of this campaign every single day. The forces dead set on destroying unions are going to use this issue to distract and divide us. When they’re not shouting about it, they’re whispering and dog-whistling.So if we don’t tell the real story of how workers get ahead, how we need each other, all of us, to win justice and dignity at work, if we don’t spread that truth, we’ll be ceding the story to their messages of hate.Brothers and sisters, not on our watch!You don’t need me to tell you how the haters are trying to use immigration to tear us apart. You see it every day. You hear it every day. It’s on your TVs. It’s in your social feeds.But here’s what they keep getting wrong about immigration: in America, immigration is about coming together. Union members and our families come from every country in the world, and our labor movement has trade union partners around the globe. These connections are a source of strength and vitality for our country, our workforce and our movement. Each new travel ban and hostile enforcement action imposed by this administration undermines our values, our competitiveness and our standing in the world.But it will never—and I mean never—undermine our solidarity.If we fracture, then we’re betraying our history as a labor movement, and we’re dooming our future. Because what we’re dealing with today is ugly, but it isn’t new. The mine owners in my hometown tried to divide us by language, by nationality, by religion. They had a dirty name for each and every one of us.But guess what happened? Our grandparents pulled together as the United Mine Workers of America. They stood strong in solidarity despite different accents and origins. That union—my union—won good jobs—hope overcame hate—and America grew stronger as a result.That was the labor movement at our best, and it’s what we need to do today.Because when you attack immigrants, you attack workers. And we won’t stand for any of it!We all have a stake in this fight because when more people are forced to work in fear, when more people are forced to work without rights, we’re all at greater risk.Think about this: In 2018, the U.S. spent $24 billion on immigration enforcement and only $2 billion on labor enforcement. That’s twelve times more to hunt down immigrants than keep us safe on the job. So are you surprised when workplace deaths go up? Are you surprised when companies cut corners to save a buck?Brothers and sisters, budgets reflect priorities. And in this government…we don’t seem to matter very much. The Trump administration doesn’t value our work or our humanity, and the numbers don’t lie.They may not want to listen to us. But brothers and sisters, we will be heard!We need to fight back—together. Our solidarity is our strength and it must be our strategy. The way we fight best is by restoring humanity and common sense to this conversation. To remind the country that this is personal to us. This is personal to our families, and our unions.And that’s why I’m so grateful that this morning, we’re going to hear the stories of these men and women—from Wilna, Hector, Rafael and Mahya. Real stories from real people about real experiences with real consequences. When we are deporting military veterans and witnesses to workplace tragedies, something is wrong. When worksites are dangerous, but it's the workers who get taken away in handcuffs, something is wrong. When we are stripping away and denying rights based on where workers are from, something is wrong, and it's our job to work together to fix it.These stories matter. These voices matter. And it is our job to make sure everyone hears them. So let’s listen—and then let’s get loud.It’s now my honor to hand the floor to the president of the Ironworkers and the new chair of the AFL-CIO Immigration committee, my brother, Eric Dean.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

159,Trumka at AFL-CIO Civil and Human Rights Conference: Give Us the Ballot,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-afl-cio-civil-and-human-rights-conference-give-us-ballot,1-17-2020,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the 2020 AFL-CIO Martin Luther King Jr. Civil and Human Rights Conference:Good morning, brothers and sisters. Thank you for being here today. Thank you for making the Martin Luther King Jr. Civil and Human Rights Conference a part of your observance during this holiday weekend of reflection and action.The power of Dr. King’s words and example are in each of you—in your focus, your fierceness, your fighting spirit. It’s a reminder that Dr. King’s legacy is shaped by the leaders who came after him...those who carry forward the torch he lit.This year, one of those leaders is very much on our minds. I want to take a moment this morning to send our best wishes to America’s greatest living civil rights hero, the conscience of the Congress, Representative John Lewis.When Alabama’s state troopers hunted for blood on that Sunday in Selma, John Lewis was the first marcher they met. The world learned that day that you might hit John Lewis, but you can’t break him. And I know that cancer has never met a match like the distinguished gentleman from Georgia.Dr. King called for that march in Selma because of a man named Jimmie Lee Jackson. He was a woodcutter and a deacon and just 26 years old when the police shot and killed him. For what? As King said at the young man’s funeral, “Jimmie Jackson just wanted to vote.”A few weeks later, 600 marchers set out in Selma. A few days after that, LBJ called on Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act. And in the decades that followed, the number of black voters in the South more than doubled. So did the number of black elected officials. One of them, sent time and again to represent the hometown of MLK, was John Lewis.Dr. King’s fight...the civil rights fight...our fight—was for goals both big and basic. Integration. Education. Jobs. Dignity. Respect. And a union! It was also about the insidious and inane injustices that protected the powerful. You know these stories.Making somebody who just wanted to vote calculate the number of bubbles in a bar of soap.Making somebody recite the preamble to the Constitution just to exercise the rights it promises. By the way, does anybody here think the current president could pass that test?Or how about this: court orders in the South that prohibited three or more African Americans from meeting together at the same time.Does that sound familiar? It should. Because it’s the kind of thing those in power always do when they’re scared. They’re scared of what happens when the people they’re trying to keep down come together. To protest. To vote. To organize. To unionize. To look at those who are standing over them and still summon the belief: we shall overcome!That’s why, six years before Dr. King stood at the Lincoln Memorial and dreamed, he demanded the vote from those very same steps.He was tired of the tests and trickery, the intimidation and insults. He was tired of being expected to ask permission for what was rightly his. So he refused to make a polite request for the ballot. He insisted on it. “Give us the ballot,” he demanded—not “give us the ballot, please.”On top of everything else, why was the franchise something worth fighting for? Dr. King demanded the ballot because he knew its potential. He knew that nothing else in a democracy makes the powerless so powerful.Give us the ballot, King preached, and we will use our vote to stand up against violence.Give us the ballot, King preached, and we will use it to make sure that voices of virtue are louder than the “bloodthirsty mobs.”Give us the ballot, King preached, and we will elect to Congress men and women who are so committed to justice that they are willing to give their lives in its name. Americans like our brother John Lewis.Give us the ballot, King knew, and you give us the chance to write our own future.A future of justice. A future of peace. A future defined by unions. That’s why Dr. King sacrificed his life marching for those sanitation workers in Memphis.That’s why he exposed right to work as a false slogan designed to “rob us of our civil rights and job rights.”And that's why—more than ever before—we must come together in his name.Take a second to look at the people around you.We are a family.And whenever anyone tries to keep us from using our voice...from casting our vote...whenever anyone tries to build a wall between us—that’s the first sign they’re scared.Because they know that our solidarity is our strength. They know that when we’re united, they’ll be defeated.Brothers and sisters, the best way to honor Dr. King’s memory is to lock arms and carry his torch forward together.Jimmie Lee Jackson just wanted to vote. John Lewis just wanted to vote. Dr. King just wanted all of us to vote.Brothers and sisters, the fights of Martin Luther King’s day are still our fights today.Today’s Supreme Court weakened the Voting Rights Act.Today’s Supreme Court gave us Janus—which wasn’t just an attack on public sector unions. It was an attack on the people of color who make those unions go.Today’s voter ID laws are the new poll taxes and literacy tests.Today’s attacks on early voting...extreme gerrymandering...voter purges like what’s happening this very moment in Wisconsin—they’re still our fights.They’re still our fights so long as this White House gins up fiction about illegal votes and cooks up commissions in search of nonexistent fraud.And they’re still our fights so long as the governor of Alabama—a successor to George Wallace —brings a major manufacturer to his state by promising to silence unions.Oh, but they have another thing coming, don’t they? In 2019, we gave them a preview of what we do with our ballot.We took out an anti-worker governor in Kentucky. We re-elected a pro-worker governor in Louisiana. We won a labor-friendly legislative majority in Virginia. And we’re just getting started.Union approval is at 64 percent—the highest in nearly 50 years. Union members are running for office—and winning. We are going on strike—and winning. And the rest of the country wants in! More than 60 million workers say that if they’re given the chance, they would vote to join a union. You know what that sounds like to me? They’re saying: just give us the ballot!Brothers and sisters, our voice must still demand the ballot, protect the ballot, make our ballot count. And in turn, the ballot amplifies our collective voice.Brothers and sisters, they’re scared of us. But we’re not scared of them, are we?They fear the future, don’t they? But we welcome it with hope.They don’t want to hear our demands, do they? Well, that just makes us louder.We’ll make them look us in the eyes—and when they do, they won’t see fright. They’ll see a fight!We’re not shying away from this moment. We’re not sitting out this battle.We’re the ones who make America great. We keep it safe. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We build the roads, fight the fires and lift the loads. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide.We wake our country up every single day. We tuck her into bed at night. And come Election Day...we vote!We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united. We’re the American labor movement and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!Thank you, and God bless you!

160,Trumka at MIT: The Future Is What We Make of It ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-mit-future-what-we-make-it,11-20-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the MIT School of Management: Professor (Tom) Kochan, thank you so much for that introduction. You’d probably be happy to know that I quote your worker voice study in almost every speech I deliver. So let me just get it out of the way now. Research from MIT shows that more than 60 million workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance.It is a pleasure to be with all of you. I just had a meeting with President Reif about the future of work. This is the issue dominating every room I’m in these days. I imagine it’s a pretty big topic of conversation across this school as well.As future managers, you are uniquely positioned to shape the trajectory of our economy, our country and quite frankly, the entire world. And for those of you who are engineering students, the big decisions around technology and automation and artificial intelligence could one day be in your hands. So as someone who represents 55 unions, 12.5 million workers and the hopes of those aspiring union members in Professor Kochan’s survey, I truly value this opportunity to spend some time with you.At its core, I believe the future of work debate is about voice. Who has a say in the development and deployment of technology? Who owns, controls and profits from the data we all generate?  Who decides how the benefits of technology are distributed? Who gets to set the ground rules on the ethics of information technology, on questions of privacy and prejudice? Sometimes it seems like we are quickly heading toward a future where these choices are made exclusively by billionaires...where the future of work is determined in behind closed doors, in rooms where workers are not allowed in.But I don’t think that is going to be our future. America’s workers, particularly young people, are tired of being silenced. We are hungry for connection to each other, so we can influence the decisions that will shape the future.At the AFL-CIO’s 2017 Convention, we formed a commission on the future of work and unions.  And just as we began our work, it became clear that a generation of rigged economic rules and anti-worker attacks had awakened the incredible passion and power of working people. Teachers in states where collective bargaining is illegal successfully walked out for better pay and smaller class sizes. Google employees went on strike around the world in support of the #MeToo movement and climate justice. Graduate students are organizing like never before. 50,000 UAW members at General Motors went on strike and won. Their demand was simple: if workers share in the sacrifice, we should also share in the profits. In California, after a heated debate and the full-scale opposition of Uber and Lyft, the governor signed legislation into law, clarifying that more than a million workers who had been misclassified as independent contractors are really employees and should be given all the rights and protections that workers have fought for and won over the years. Workers inside and outside of unions have stood together to win progress on everything from sexual harassment to immigration to climate change. And across the Charles in Boston, Marriott workers were part of a nationwide strike, winning a say in how new technologies are deployed in the hotel business. Union approval is at 64 percent, the highest in nearly 50 years. 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in a generation. This uprising comes as the astounding technologies of the digital revolution have the potential to improve workers’ lives, but also threaten to degrade or eliminate millions of jobs. And nothing less than our democracy hangs in the balance. Exactly who gets to be heard in the workplace, in the economy and ultimately in politics is the great question of the modern age.  I served as president of the United Mine Workers of America for 17 years. It was one of the greatest honors of my life. This is a union with a long history of raising the voices of coal miners and our communities. We believe in democracy. In justice. And in fairness for all. So, when apartheid in South Africa was in full swing, I couldn’t help think about our fights in the hills of West Virginia and Kentucky. The struggle to be treated as human beings. To have a voice at work, a share in the wealth we created and a real chance to elect people to government who represented us. And when I met a young South African miner named Cyril Ramaphoza, I realized we were brothers on the same journey. Now fast forward thirty years. Cyril is the President of South Africa. And together with the Prime Minister of Sweden, a former metal worker, Cyril co-chaired the International Labor Organization’s commission on the future of work. This commission’s report makes clear that the real issue isn’t technology itself. The real issue is the human arrangements that shape how technology is used and who reaps the benefits. And the real question is whether human beings will be listened to and respected. Will our work be honored? Will our voices be heard?And, I don't think it’s a coincidence that both MIT’s Task Force on the Work of the Future, led by your distinguished scholars David Autor and David Mindell, and the AFL-CIO Commission on the Future of Work and Unions that I mentioned earlier, agreed with the ILO Commission that working people must be in the room when the decisions get made that shape how technology is used in the workplace.Consider what happens when working people’s voices are not heard.In the past thirty years in the United States, wages have been flat as productivity has soared.  Less than 7 percent of the private sector workforce now belongs to a union or is protected by collective bargaining. Inequality has reached historic levels. In fact, 40 percent of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for an emergency. And study after study shows that political power has flowed directly to the very wealthy and away from the common working person. And the result? A study from, forgive me, Harvard University, showed that only 30 percent of millenials believe it’s essential to live in a democratic nation. 25 percent actually said democracy is bad. I believe this reflects the simple truth that your generation increasingly equates our system of government with economic inequality and political instability. If we want to secure a democratic and prosperous future, working people must have a real seat at the table when it comes to the design and deployment of innovation. After all, the unmistakable role of public funding in U.S. innovation policy provides a clear rationale for actively steering the direction of research and innovation to ensure that technological advances benefit workers and society broadly, not just a handful of private interests.But in order to make our voices heard in this process, working people must have the expertise to make our seat at the table count for something. So, the AFL-CIO is in the process of setting up a technology institute to connect the labor movement with institutions like MIT. The goal is to help us gain the knowledge and capacity needed to engage broadly in the complex innovation process, so technology is used as a force for good, not greed. At the same time, this is not our first rodeo. Before the punch clock and the assembly line, there was the hand tool and the workshop. Before the hardhat, there was the artisan's apron. Before diesel and electricity, there was steam. Times changed. Our jobs changed. And we changed with them, building a more prosperous nation and a stronger labor movement in the process. And, we’ve learned a lot, like if workers aren’t involved in the design of technology we’re supposed to use at work, then the technology will probably be poorly designed in basic ways. In other words, it just won’t work.If workers don’t have power, the kind of power that only can be won through collective bargaining, businesses are likely to make short-sighted decisions about how to deploy technology...and that can end up destroying valuable human capital in the process.And, if workers don’t share in the gains from technology, the resulting inequality will exacerbate our broken economy, our divided communities and indeed, our toxic politics. It’s a vicious cycle, one that working people can have a hand in changing and reshaping for the better. And that brings me back to our common future and the role you can play as leaders. We are at a moment where the world urgently needs to take on the greatest challenges of our time: global poverty and climate change. Innovation, technology and productivity growth can provide solutions. But not if we sit and wait for someone else to do it.  The path forward is right in front of us: If the United States invests the trillions of dollars needed to rebuild our infrastructure, we can put millions of people to work in good union jobs and maintain strong job growth. Then, millions of good jobs can be created by investing, organizing and raising labor standards in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors. The fastest and most equitable way to address climate change is to create solutions that reduce emissions while investing in our communities, maintaining and creating high-wage union jobs and reducing poverty. We also think it’s high time to end the growing trend of work swallowing more and more of life. Rising productivity should mean shorter work hours. We should consider moving toward a four-day workweek. That is the logical consequence of predictions that artificial intelligence and other new technologies will make workers far more productive in the future.  But even if the predicted spike in worker productivity never materializes, there is a very strong case for redistributing work hours today—that is, for limiting the excessive hours worked by some people, thereby making more work hours available to those who want to work more, and giving all workers control over our time. Doing so could help ensure the benefits of technological progress are shared broadly.In a world of full employment where workers have bargaining power and an effective voice, technological change should mean rising wages, falling hours and better lives. If that isn’t happening, we should point the finger, not at science or technology, but at the domination of the wealthy over our economics and our politics.I want to close by pointing out that the path to a positive future of work, one compatible with democracy, is not just about technology. As part of our commission, we undertook a serious self-assessment at how we could attract a workforce that is growing increasingly more diverse. According to the Census Bureau, people of color will become the majority of the U.S. population by 2045. The shift will occur by next year for those younger than 18. The labor movement is already nearly 7 million women, and by 2025, they are on track to make up more than half of the union workforce.So, if we do this right, the labor movement can be the place where ALL working people come together, and no one gets left behind. Strengthening fair employment laws...adopting protections for workers who are discriminated against because of their gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity...comprehensive immigration reform...voting rights...civil rights...LGBTQ rights...a path to secure work and upward mobility for young people...this is the broad-based agenda that will build solidarity and power for all who work for a living. I remember sitting in law school at Villanova in the 1970s and wondering what I would do next. The choices I’ve made in the 50 years since—to become active in my union, to pursue a career in the labor movement, to serve others—they have put me in a position to do some real good. And that has made every day worth living. That’s what I want for you as future leaders at the intersection of business and technology and innovation. I want you to have a seat at the table and a voice in the debate. I want you to study and search and shape. And, I want you to not be afraid to fail. Whether it’s reversing a generation of income inequality or tackling climate change, there is big work to be done. It’s going to take some risks, but the rewards will be worth it. The future is what we make of it. And…to do the great work that must be done in America and around the world…all of us...managers...engineers…financial experts…construction workers…teachers…must work together.Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.  © 2023 AFL-CIO.

161,Trumka on New NAFTA at Maryland/DC AFL-CIO Convention: We Are Not There Yet,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-new-nafta-marylanddc-afl-cio-convention-we-are-not-there-yet,11-18-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Maryland State and DC AFL-CIO 32nd Biennial Convention:Sister Donna (Edwards), thank you so much for that introduction. You and Brother Gerald (Jackson) are doing an incredible job leading this federation forward. It is an honor to be here at a union casino and a union hotel. What a great place for a convention. And what a great time to be in the labor movement.I’ve been in the trenches for more than 50 years, brothers and sisters, and I’ve never been more excited. We are rising. We are fighting. We are demanding better. From Baltimore to Bowie. From the Eastern Shore to Washington, D.C.At a time when our politics and our culture wants us isolated and bitter and ready to blame, working people are, instead, turning to each other. Union approval is at 64 percent, the highest in nearly 50 years. 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in a generation. More than 60 million workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance.And how about those elections? We took out an anti-worker governor in Kentucky. We re-elected a pro-worker governor in Louisiana. We captured a labor-friendly legislative majority in Virginia. And we elected a brand new class of union member candidates. All told, more than 400 of our brothers and sisters won public office in 2019. They will now join the nearly 1,000 card-carrying union members elected last year, including 12 members of the Maryland State House and 5 members of the Maryland State Senate.This election was just the latest criscendo in an ongoing surge of collective action by working people. 85,000 workers went on strike in just a single week this October. We’ve walked off the job to win better contracts at Marriott and GM. Teachers are continuing to challenge the status quo in Republican states and Democratic cities alike—showing the entire country what’s possible when we stand together.This uprising is alive and well here in Maryland. Baltimore teachers and musicians stood strong during tough contract fights and in the case of AFM, an illegal lockout. UAW members at Volvo near Hagerstown went on strike and won better pay, benefits and job security. And I was privileged to experience the determination of working people firsthand when nurses rallied outside John Hopkins Hospital during a heat wave this July. Man, that was a hot day!Nurses are the most trusted public servants in our nation. They treat the sick. They comfort our families. They support our communities. And they deserve a voice on the job!We know it won’t be easy. Johns Hopkins has spent millions of dollars to prevent nurses from organizing. Management interrogated nurses and took steps to block workers from having conversations about forming a union. They’ve even gone so far as to fire union supporters.But here’s the thing...no corporation or institution is stronger than a committed group of working people willing to risk everything for each other. And when that group of people happens to be nurses, you better believe we are going to win. It won’t be fast. It won’t be easy. But with National Nurses United leading the way, we’re going to make John Hopkins a union hospital!Something is happening in America, brothers and sisters.In the richest country in the world...at our richest point in history...workers are deciding that one job should be enough!That no one should go broke just because they get sick.That no one should earn less because of their gender.That no one should be fired for who they are.Everyone should have a voice.Everyone should have a fair shot and a fair shake.And everyone should be able to form a union.Brothers and sisters, are you with me?This is our time.This is our moment.This is our country.And we’re taking it back for the people who work!The labor movement’s recent success is a reminder that when we sacrifice the comforts of today for the progress of tomorrow, real change is within our reach. So we’re telling everyone within the sound of our voice: If you want power—join a union.Of course, with more than 60 million workers saying they want in, you’d think unions would be growing at an exponential rate. But our badly outdated labor laws, which haven’t been
strengthened since 1935, continue to make the job of organizing unreasonably hard. Employers like Johns Hopkins hire high-price attorneys and consultants to scare workers into accepting business as usual.That’s why we need to pass the PRO Act—Protecting the Right to Organize.The PRO Act would let us do our jobs without interference from anti-union employers or anti-worker politicians.We have wanted labor law reform for a long time, so workers can fairly choose to form or join unions. Well, sometimes you've got to knock on the door before you get in. We've been knocking. How many of you remember the Employee Free Choice Act? It was the first major piece of labor reform legislation in a generation or more, and we came up just a few votes short.In the years since that setback, the labor movement has never stopped educating working people and legislators about the importance of raising wages through fair and modern labor laws.The PRO Act protects the right to strike. It includes first contract arbitration, substantial relief for workers whose rights have been violated and real penalties for employers who break the law.And here is one of the most underrated pieces of this legislation. It removes the employer’s standing in representation cases. The choice to form a union should be that of workers alone. They don’t ask for our input when making a decision about work. So they have no business attempting to influence who we choose to sit at the bargaining table.The PRO Act is our strongest bill yet—and just last week, we reached 218 cosponsors, a majority of the U.S. House of Representatives. I am hopeful Speaker Nancy Pelosi will bring it up for a vote soon. We’re making progress on labor law reform. And we’re making progress on trade. I want to address some of the rumors floating around about the future of NAFTA. Here is what I know to be true. First and foremost, corporate-written trade has been a disaster for working people. Maryland has lost more than 70,000 manufacturing jobs in the era of NAFTA and trade with China. The GM plant in White Marsh. The iconic Luke paper mill, which faced constant pressure from Chinese imports. It never stops. So the labor movement jumped at the chance to make trade work for working people. We’ve been lobbying the White House specifically on NAFTA for more than two years, slowly but surely moving the ball down the field. But we are not there yet. Let me repeat: we are not there yet. I know from experience this can be one of the most dangerous points in a negotiation. An agreement is in sight so you fold on core issues in order to get across the finish line. I will not allow that to happen.We are in a position of tremendous strength. Our allies on Capitol Hill understand that getting this done right is more important than getting it done fast. So until the administration can show us in writing that the new NAFTA is truly enforceable with stronger labor standards, there is still more work to be done.Close is not good enough. Not when millions of jobs are at stake. Not when lives and livelihoods hang in the balance. Not after 25 years of devastation and destruction. We are ready for a victory on NAFTA. Bring us a deal that's good for workers and we will use our voice and muscle to pass it. But we cannot and will not support any deal that does not deliver for working people.On NAFTA...and the TPP fight before it...and every battle we face, unity is the key to our success. United we soar. Divided we crumble. When our public sector brothers and sisters faced the threat of Janus at the Supreme Court, we rallied to their defense. And guess what? Despite that horrible decision, public sector affiliates are growing. Turns out people like their union! When the Trump Administration tried to water down registered apprenticeships in the building trades—the best training programs in the world—we all made our opposition clear to the Department of Labor.And when Donald Trump shut down the federal government, forcing hundreds of thousands of federal employees to go without a paycheck, including 90,000 people here in Maryland, the entire labor rallied and fought until the president finally caved. The people who want to destroy the labor movement have always tried to rip us apart. Public against private. Rural against urban. Immigrant against native born. Ravens against Steelers. We cannot fall for it. There is no stronger bond than the one we have as union members. We hold each other’s futures in our hands. I know my partner and sister AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler was here this morning. She has a unique ability to bring our diverse unions together. She is a bridge builder. She understands that solidarity will position us to tackle the biggest challenges of our time—from inequality and climate change to automation and equal opportunity. The late great Elijah Cummings said his mission was to make people realize that the power is within them and that they too can do the things they want to do.That is our mission, too. That’s how we’re winning today. And that’s how we’re going to take back this country in 2020.We know it won’t be easy. Watching the news these days can be almost too much to bear.Americans are being scapegoated, minimized, dehumanized and told to go back where they came from. Voting and the free press are under attack. The very foundation of our democracy is being chipped away.Our nation’s welcome mat, long a beacon of hope for immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, including my family, is being bulldozed and paved over, replaced with a clear message: “you’re not welcome here.”The president uses his Twitter account to demean and divide rather than inform and inspire. He routinely picks on the most vulnerable among us—women of color, people with disabilities, transgender Americans, immigrants—even Gold Star families.And what about the promises to protect American jobs, invest in infrastructure and change the economic rules? Well, he’s changed the rules all right—but not to benefit any of us.Wall Street got another windfall tax cut. Workplace safety regulations have been gutted. They stole our overtime pay. And a management side lawyer with a history of union-bashing and busting is the new Secretary of Labor.Brothers and sisters, enough is enough. We’re demanding better. We deserve better. And in 2020, we’re going to win better.But I also have a warning for the Democratic Party.We are not your ATM. You must work for us, not the other way around.We’re setting the bar high—higher than it’s ever been.Put plainly, my message today is this: If you want our endorsement...if you want our vote...if you want our support...then show us that you’re unambiguously pro-worker and pro-union. Tell us about your plan to make it easier to form unions and harder to bust them. Show us that workers are more than a section on your website or a line in your biography. Make growing today’s labor movement a top priority.The late governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, said you campaign in poetry...and you govern in prose. But for too long, our elected leaders have campaigned in promises and governed in excuses.Or worse.We’re refusing to accept business as usual. Not when...in some parts of the country...it’s still harder to form a union than climb a mountain. Not when 40 percent of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for an emergency. Not when in the past 30 years, the top 1 percent has gained $21 trillion in wealth, while the bottom 50 percent has lost $900 billion.Working people built this country from the ground up. We keep her running every day. Yet far too often, we’ve been disrespected, disregarded and abandoned. So, we are demanding from a president the same thing we demand of ourselves: Hard work. Integrity. Honor. Guts. Grit. And, sacrifice. It doesn’t matter if there’s a D, R or I next to your name. If you refuse to truly make the cause of workers your own, then we cannot endorse you.But...if you join us...and fight for us…and walk in our shoes...we will move heaven and earth to elect you. And together, we can put this country back where it belongs...in the hands of the workers who make it go.We’ll march for it. We’ll organize for it. We’ll fight for it.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?We’re going to fight for higher pay.We’re going to fight for better health care.We’re going to fight for a secure retirement.And, we’re going to fight for an economy where every worker...every single worker...has the freedom to form a union and bargain collectively.We’ve earned it, brothers and sisters. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We put food on the table. We care for the sick. We build the cars and fight the fires. We serve our nation with dignity and pride. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night!This is our time! This is our moment!WE are the American labor movement...and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!Thank you, brothers and sisters! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
162,Trumka Receives the 2019 NIAF Leonardo da Vinci Achievement Award,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-receives-2019-niaf-leonardo-da-vinci-achievement-award,11-2-2019,"Maria, thank you, and grazie mille to NIAF for this honor. Congratulations to the other award recipients for their well-deserved recognition, too. Being here tonight surrounded by my family and some of my closest friends and getting to share a delicious meal is the true essence of being an Italian-American. My mother’s parents, Attilio and Albertina Bertugli, were two of the most influential people in my life. When I was a kid, they lived about six miles away from us, and every Sunday, we would go to church together. Afterwards, we’d come back for dinner and then the cousins would play all afternoon. What more could you want?I wish Attilio and Albertina could be here tonight. My grandmother had a saying, ""stana tupe benne,"" which means ""from everything comes some good.""Those are words that she lived by. No matter what happened, she found something positive to take away from it.  On a recent trip to Italy, my grandmother’s optimism washed over me. I visited the courtyard where she and my grandfather first met and fell in love in the little town of Sassuolo. I’ve never felt more at peace. Or at home. Or more connected. At the base of the Duomo in Florence, there’s a little cafe. Early one morning, an older gentleman and I were having a cup of coffee. Have you ever watched an Italian drink a cup of coffee? In that moment, there is nothing more important in the world. They savor the experience. The past and the future seem far away. Now is all that matters. In our world of division and distraction, we should find time to enjoy the journey and remember that each day is a gift from God. Sometimes, it’s easier said than done. There are many things that make my heart ache today. The unnecessary pain and suffering of working people. The artificial walls being built between us. The isolation. The greed. But, I am comforted by the great blessings of my life. A beautiful wife. Children and grandchildren who bring me more joy than words could ever describe. The most loyal friends a guy could ever ask for. A job where I can truly make a difference. And every once in a while, branzino with a side of linguini. My grandmother had it right all along. Stana tupe benne. Thank you, and God bless you. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
163,Trumka at the Joe Rauh Lecture: Anything is Possible When Working People Stand Together,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-joe-rauh-lecture-anything-possible-when-working-people-stand-together,10-24-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the University of the District of Columbia Law School's Annual Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. Lecture:Good evening. Dean Hutchins, thank you for the invitation to speak tonight. It’s a great honor for me to be here. Chip, my brother, thank you. We go back a long time. If it wasn’t for your dad, Jock Yablonski, and of course, Joe Rauh, I wouldn’t be standing here today as the president of the AFL-CIO, a federation of unions representing 12.5 million working men and women. And, if it weren’t for Chip, Jock and Joe and Danny Edelman, the United Mine Workers of America, my union for over 50 years, would not be the free and democratic organization that it is today.This is the story I want to tell you tonight. It goes back quite a bit, but it’s one worth telling because, in many ways, history is repeating itself today. And, there are lessons from the past we can all heed. I was raised in a small sliver of southwestern Pennsylvania called Nemacolin. It was a company town. The coal barons owned everything except the church and the union hall. They even printed and paid in money that could only be used at coal-owned businesses. One night when I was little, I was complaining to my grandfather about the way the coal company was treating miners like him. He asked what I planned to do about it. “When I grow up, I could be a politician.” Well, that got me a playful smack on the head. Wrong answer. So then I said: “How about a lawyer, so I can stand up for workers?” Bingo. That’s what he wanted to hear. Then my grandfather said something that has always stuck with me: “If you want to help workers, you first need to help people.” It was a message about fairness, dignity and justice for all. When it was time to go to work, I followed my father and grandfather into the mines. That’s what Trumka men did. I also went to college at Penn State and then law school at Villanova. I often studied underground using the light from my helmet. I’m forever grateful for my time in the mines. It’s a job that teaches you the nature of hard work...of creating value out of a hole in the ground. That’s something that gets passed down to the next generation. It was certainly passed down to me and Jock Yablonski. Jock, who was also the son of a miner, got his start in the coalfields at a young age, too. As he rose up through the ranks of the Mine Workers, it became clear to him how a union should operate. He believed that working people should have a voice independent of their employer. And, that the union was there to serve the workers, not the other way around. When Jock ran for president of the Mine Workers in 1969, the need for democracy—both inside and outside our ranks—was greater than ever before. It was a time of great strife and grief across the country. This was the beginning of the Vietnam War. Nixon was president, though it was still a few years before Watergate. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy had been shot and killed the year before. The Stonewall uprising for LGBTQ rights took place that year, as did Woodstock and the first moon landing. The Civil Rights Act had been passed, but it was still a long way from being truly enforced. There were riots, marches and protests over civil rights and equality. Unions were rising up, too. The growth of the public sector throughout the 1960s brought demands for better wages and protections on the job. Remember, Dr. King was shot and killed while fighting for striking sanitation workers in Memphis. The strike was called the “I Am A Man” strike. People were striking to be recognized and have dignity at work. One of the sanitation workers was killed on the job, and it precipitated the strike that Dr. King attended and where he was ultimately killed. And then, in the fateful year of 1969, thousands of mineworkers marched on the state capitol in Charleston, West Virginia, demanding protections against Black Lung disease. Their uprisings ultimately got the governor to sign the first legislation in the country recognizing Black Lung as an occupational hazard.As working people were fighting for democracy in the country at large, we were also waging a battle within our own unions. The president of the Mine Workers, Tony Boyle, had been around for a long time. He ran things a certain way, and a lot of people weren’t satisfied with his leadership. You couldn’t get a copy of the union’s constitution to know what your rights were. You couldn’t get a copy of your union contract to know what your benefits were. You couldn’t file a grievance, which, in a union, is how you can raise concerns over an issue with management. And then, there was the election tampering. For example, Boyle’s guys would say the union meeting would start at 6 p.m. So, you’d go campaigning and pass out materials until ten minutes or so before the meeting started. You’d walk in and the room would be empty. The meeting was over. They purposely told you the wrong time. But, that’s not all of the dirty tricks they pulled. Boyle was also using member dues money for his campaign. Just like in a public election, you need a separate pot of funds to run for union office. Yet, Boyle used official resources for campaign swag, like clocks with his name on them, given as gifts while trying to buy someone’s vote. To this day, I have a campaign pen in the top drawer of my desk. If you click the top, Boyle and the other names on his ballot are displayed. With each click of that pen, I’m reminded of why we can never give up the fight for justice.Meanwhile, Jock wanted the average miner to know that being in a union meant you had a voice and could use it. And that your elected officers were there to serve. That democracy was alive in our union halls. That’s why he ran for president. The vote was held in November of 1969, and Jock lost. As you can imagine, the deck was stacked against him. We were trying to get a new election set up, but on New Year’s Eve, Jock was murdered in cold blood, along with his wife and daughter. Jock had set out for reform, and it cost him and his family their lives.It was devastating, and it was demoralizing. No one was sure what was going to happen next. Then, we realized that Jock was a symbol of something bigger. He was a symbol of everything that we had been fighting for: A union that has your back. True solidarity, where your fight is my fight and my fight is your fight. And, thanks to this evening’s namesake, Joe Rauh, that all became clear again.Joe helped bring Jock’s vision back from the brink. He was the constant that miners and their families needed. Joe was gutsy. No one could intimidate him. He was your guy—and you never doubted it. Everybody knew if Joe was representing you, then you’d have a loyal fighter until the end. He stood for us—and with us.  For that, the other side lobbed attack after attack trying to discredit him. Throughout his career, they called him a commie and a fraud. But, no one had the guts to say he was a bad lawyer. Joe was one hell of an attorney, and he believed in the power of democracy. In equality. In fairness. This fight was in his blood, and you can’t turn away from it. So, Miners for Democracy became more focused, more clear and more determined. We fought for justice for Jock, and we fought for democracy for our union. Later, Joe worked to unseat Boyle and put him behind bars—and he succeeded not once, but twice, of having him convicted of murder. Throughout his career, Joe was a force for good. He was a force for working people. He was a force for the common man and common woman. As Joe made our case in court, Miners for Democracy took hold and grew. We worked to become a progressive force, moving our union forward and advocating for our members and our communities. We knew our voices together were stronger than the voices of one individual. Thirty-seven years ago, on Christmas week at the Charleston Civic Center in West Virginia, I raised my right hand and took the oath of office as president of the United Mine Workers. I was 33. It was one of the greatest days of my life. I was sworn in by my dad, who gave his heart and his life to this union. He died of Black Lung Disease like every male of that generation in my family. You could feel a changing of the guard that day in Charleston. And, just as Jock had taught us, we said the United Mine Workers union was put on this earth for its members to have a better life, not for its leaders to have a higher status. It was the first time we held our inauguration in coal country, and the event was opened up to the rank and file membership. And one thing I remember on that beautiful, sunny day, is that people, our members, stopped looking at their shoes. They didn’t look down anymore. This was their union. We had avenged Jock’s murder. Joe Rauh’s efforts and great legal work made that possible. So, what can we learn from these great leaders? That anything is possible when we stand together. It’s been half a century since Jock was killed, yet today we are experiencing a new democratic revolution. Workers aren’t looking down at their shoes anymore. Standing on the foundation of a democratic union movement, preserved by Jock and Joe and so many others, we are looking our employers squarely in the eyes and delivering a clear message: Enough. In the richest nation on the face of the earth, at its richest point in time, we are refusing to accept an economy where 40% of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for an emergency. We’re not sitting quietly by when in the past 30 years, the top 1% has gained $21 trillion in wealth, while the bottom 50% has LOST $900 billion. The reality is that the systems and institutions we’re supposed to rely on are badly broken. Not because they’re old. Because they’ve been rigged. Our economy and our politics simply do not work for the majority of people because corporations and politicians have conspired to make it that way. In 1969, we didn’t have to convince our fellow miners that democracy was a good thing. Today, our job is much harder. A study from Joe’s law school alma mater, Harvard, found that only 30% of millennials believe it’s essential to live in a democracy. 25% actually said democracy is bad. I believe this reflects the simple truth that young people are becoming more disillusioned as they bear the brunt of our broken economy. However, it’s still a startling...and frankly, heartbreaking...statistic given what generations of people before us, like Joe and Jock, went through to secure and protect our democracy. So, it’s up to us to carry the mantle forward. Make no mistake, progress has been made, slowly, but surely. The protectors of the status quo told people of color they can’t integrate, but we won the battle. They warned workers not to form a union or else, but we did it anyway. They told LGBTQ people they can’t marry, but now it’s the law of the land. And, they’ve been telling immigrants and asylum seekers to stay away, but no wall is big enough to stop the human desire to be free.Over and over and over again, ordinary people have proven we can win big lasting change. That’s why in my more than 50 years in this work, I’ve never been more optimistic than I am today. Look around the country. 50,000 UAW members won a strike against GM for better wages. 35,000 teachers in Chicago are on the picket lines as we speak, marching for respect on the job and better classrooms for their students. Whether it’s Black Lives Matter, the #MeToo movement or young people coming together to stop violence and protect the planet—all of these are collective actions where people are saying: “The only way we’re going to get this done is if we stand together and lock arms with the people standing next to us.” When we do that, nothing can stop us. No crooked politician or corporate baron or self-interested union leader has ever been a match for ordinary people who’ve banded together. Not even a right-wing activist Supreme Court can bring us down. Last year’s Janus decision was part of an effort to fundamentally alter the foundation of our democracy, so it serves a single, solitary purpose—concentrating power and wealth in the hands of a select few. Yet, more than a year after that decision, guess what? We’re still standing strong! In fact, the two major AFL-CIO unions specifically targeted by this case, AFSCME and the American Federation of Teachers, have actually grown. And, the labor movement has a 64% approval rating—the highest it’s been in nearly 50 years! At a time when our politics and culture want us more divided and bitter and ready to blame… working people are, instead… turning to each other… We are speaking out, and momentum is on our side. 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in a generation… Half a million people walked the picket lines… And, MIT found that more than 60 million workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance…That’s because more and more workers know that unions provide better wages, better benefits, better flexibility, better retirement, a better life, and most of all, democracy on the job. Listen, times are tough. But, so are working people! And, we never give up without a fight.Over the summer, we recognized the thirty-year anniversary of the Mine Workers strike against the Pittston Coal Company. It was the most trying—and rewarding—experience of my presidency and my entire career.We had just endured Ronald Reagan’s shameless attacks on the air traffic controllers union. Union-busting was the flavor of the day. There were concessions everywhere. And Pittston decided to come after the health care of our retirees and widows. That was the final straw. Because here’s something you have to understand: These retirees had given their lives to the mines. They’d come home covered in coal dust, but filled with pride that their day below ground meant they could support their families. And, part of their hard work meant the promise of a pension when they retired.For Pittston to try and take this away from them wasn’t gonna happen without a fight. Not on my watch. So, we went out on strike. It lasted for almost a year. But, with the help of the community, and the entire labor movement, we won and sent a clear message to every union-buster across this great country that we were not backing down. We were not giving up. We were not going to take it anymore! It was our “enough” moment. You see, workers are willing to endure hardship. We are the most resilient group of people the world has ever known. But what we won’t accept is the feeling of being unnecessary. What we won’t allow is for anyone to strip us of our value, our dignity and our worth. These are the lessons that Jock taught me. That Joe Rauh taught me. That a group of ordinary people can make an extraordinary difference. That the labor movement is the single greatest force for working people on the planet. And, that democracy is worth fighting for.That’s what I hope you’ll take from this lecture tonight. You’ll soon be holding a law degree in your hands. This university will send you off into a complicated world with an extraordinary opportunity and responsibility to make a real difference.How will you meet this moment? As the next generation of legal minds, you can challenge the forces that seek to tear us apart. You can help bring us together. You can advance justice, expand freedom and promote fairness.  You can do the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons. You can take the education you received here and apply it to real problems. Poverty, violence, racism, inequality, you name it. 50 years after Jock died and Joe helped us all move on, you can help strengthen democracy for generations to come. You can be lawyers for democracy. Thank you very much. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
164,"Trumka to Alabama AFL-CIO: United We Win, Divided We Fall",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-alabama-afl-cio-united-we-win-divided-we-fall,10-22-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Alabama AFL-CIO Convention:Good morning, brothers and sisters. It is an honor to be here with you today. Brother Rickey (Kornegay), thank you for that introduction. You and Brother Bren (Riley) are doing a great job leading the labor movement forward here in Alabama.I love this state. Great food. Great football. Great people. And great unions. That’s Alabama. Roll tide!You’ve maintained nearly 10% union density—more than Virginia and Georgia combined—in the face of globalization and right to work, anti-worker politicians and corporate greed. Just look at what happened with Airbus. When the French giant decided to build a $600 million manufacturing facility in Mobile, after being given more than $150 million of your hard-earned tax money, the governor credited right to work with sealing the deal. The message was clear. Workers stay quiet. And unions stay away.Airbus told employees they could have a direct relationship with management. No third parties.  Organizers know this myth well. It’s like Walmart’s open door policy. The only problem is you have absolutely no power once you get inside that door. Workers were forced to attend meetings where Airbus officials said things like: “All the union cares about is getting your dues…” and “...the union can put you on trial and fine you.” This is what we’re up against. Just yesterday, we released a report called “The Double Standard at Work.” It lays out in great detail how European companies like Airbus have come to the American South in search of cheap labor and low standards. And your elected officials have made it easy for them, offering lavish tax packages and smashing workers’ rights at every turn. Alabama doesn’t even have a minimum wage.With our report, we are calling out this hypocrisy by corporations who preach progress on one side of the Atlantic Ocean and bust unions on the other. We will continue to pressure these global players to provide good jobs here in Alabama and everywhere they operate. But we need your help. As Southern union members and leaders, you can strengthen our hand by joining together in solidarity. United, we win. Divided, we don’t have a prayer.I know unity is easier said than done here in Alabama. The corporate right-wing has been trying to pull us apart for centuries—from slavery to reconstruction, from Jim Crow to modern voter suppression. In March of 1965, right here in Montgomery, after marching for five days from Selma, Dr. King talked about racial segregation. He said it was a political tool by corporate interests to “keep the southern masses divided and southern labor the cheapest in the land.” There is no denying that we've made progress in the more than 50 years since. America elected its first black president, and earlier this month, Montgomery elected its first black mayor. Six union members won Alabama House seats in 2018 alone, part of a nationwide wave that included nearly 1,000 of our brothers and sisters. UAW broke through at a manufacturing plant in Piedmont. Health care workers in Selma and Mobile voted to join the RWDSU. And, CWA and the Steelworkers are demanding good union jobs at New Flyer in Anniston. Day after day and against all odds, Alabama workers continue to demonstrate the true power of collective action.But we are still too divided. All you need to do is open Facebook or watch the news to see that. And all these decades later, southern labor is STILL the cheapest in the land.Brothers and sisters, I’m here today to say we can change that. There is so much more that unites us than divides us. We have more in common with a worker of another race than we will EVER have with a CEO. Our jobs and health care and pensions are not under attack by immigrants or transgender people or even LSU fans—they are being surgically and strategically targeted by wealthy corporations and spineless politicians who want us so divided and so distracted that we forget to notice they are robbing us blind. I say enough.Black and white—we are union!North and South—we are union!Immigrant and native born—we are union!When we stand together, when we fight for each other, when my picket line is your picket line and your picket line is my picket line, no one can stop us.This is our time to shine. I can feel it in this room. We won’t be held down or pushed around.We built the American middle class. And we’re going to rebuild it for every single working family—starting right here in Alabama!Brothers and sisters, I’ve been at this for more than 50 years, and I’ve never been more optimistic about the labor movement. At a time when our politics and our culture wants us isolated and bitter and ready to blame, working people are, instead, turning to each other.Union approval is at 64%, the highest in nearly 50 years. 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in a generation. More than 60 million workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance.As you probably know, nearly 50,000 UAW members have been out on strike at GM for the last month. Remember, this is a company that was on the brink of collapse in 2008. The American people rescued GM with our tax dollars. And UAW members gave up their own wages, their own benefits, to carry GM out of bankruptcy. But autoworkers didn’t just save GM. They delivered years of record-breaking profits. Today, GM is pulling in tens of billions of dollars every year. Their CEO is the highest-paid auto executive in the world. Yet at first, the company put forward a contract that did not adequately share these gains. So for more than 30 days, UAW members have been striking, demanding from GM a fair piece of the profits they made possible. And guess what? They’re on the verge of a big win. The temporary agreement has higher wages. Profit sharing. Job security. And a path to permanent seniority for temps. This is a victory not just for UAW members, but for every worker who makes our country go.When we sacrifice the comforts of today for the progress of tomorrow, real change is within our reach.So we’re telling everyone we can: If you want power—join a union.Of course, with more than 60 million workers saying they want in, you’d think unions would be growing at an exponential rate. But our badly outdated labor laws, which haven’t been strengthened since 1935, continue to make the job of organizing unreasonably hard. Employers like Airbus hire high-price attorneys and consultants to scare workers into voting no. This coercion is seen in corporate boardrooms as little more than the cost of doing business. That’s why we need to pass the PRO Act—Protecting the Right to Organize. The PRO Act would let us do our jobs without interference from anti-union employers or anti-worker politicians. We have wanted labor law reform for a long time, so workers can fairly choose to form or join unions. Well, sometimes you've got to knock on the door before you get in. We've been knocking. How many of you remember the Employee Free Choice Act? It was the first major piece of labor reform legislation in a generation or more, and we came up just a few votes short. In the years since that setback, the labor movement has never stopped educating working people and legislators about the importance of raising wages through fair and modern labor laws. The PRO Act is our strongest bill yet—and we are hopeful it will pass the House before Thanksgiving. The PRO Act protects the right to strike. It includes first contract arbitration, substantial relief for workers whose rights have been violated and real penalties for employers who break the law.And here is one of the most underrated pieces of this legislation. It removes the employer’s standing in representation cases. The choice to form a union should be that of workers alone. They don’t ask for our input when making a decision about work. So they have no business attempting to influence who we choose to sit at the bargaining table.Now, there are a few Democratic holdouts on this bill, including your senator, Doug Jones. I greatly admired the race Senator Jones ran against Roy Moore, and I am proud of the work the Alabama AFL-CIO did to send him to Washington. But this is fundamental. I urge each and every one of you to call on Senator Jones to cosponsor the PRO Act today. This bill is good for Alabama. It’s good for America. And it deserves his support. Brothers and sisters, our approach to politics is pretty straightforward. If you stand with us, we will stand with you. I don’t care if you’re a Democrat or a Republican. Party doesn’t matter. We are a labor movement of issues. That’s the approach I took when Donald Trump was elected. Trump got 62 percent here. So I imagine some of you voted for him. Trust me, I get it. President Clinton gave us NAFTA. President Obama tried to give us the TPP and failed to give us labor law reform. And the 2016 Democratic ticket had more questions than answers. So I wasn’t surprised that some working people, especially here in the South, went the other way.But let’s be clear, the Republican Party’s agenda has been a disaster for working people. Right to work. Lowering our wages. Taking away our health care. The ridiculous law reducing unemployment compensation here in Alabama. Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, said only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of their right to join the union of their choice. Well, those fools are running the Grand Old Party today.So I strongly believe the 2016 election was an indictment of political elites in both parties. Donald Trump made promises that spoke directly to working people. He promised to protect American jobs, fix NAFTA and invest in infrastructure. He ripped Wall Street greed and pledged his commitment to changing the economic rules. He spoke about our issues better than Hillary Clinton ever did. After the election, I traveled up to New York to meet with Trump at his tower. I was hopeful we could work together on the few issues where we actually agreed. I committed to calling balls and strikes—supporting the president when he did something to help us and opposing him when he did something to hurt us. Well, it’s been nearly three years and I can tell you one thing for certain: Donald Trump is one of the most anti-worker presidents in American history. If you think he’s on your side, you better think again. Wall Street got another windfall tax cut. NAFTA is still in place. And when Goodyear announced it was moving the Gadsden plant to Mexico, the president was nowhere to be found. We haven’t spent a penny on infrastructure. Workplace safety regulations have been gutted. They stole our overtime pay. And a management side lawyer with a history of union-bashing and busting is the new Secretary of Labor.Forget balls and strikes, this president is throwing the pitch directly at our heads. Brothers and sisters, I will work with any leader who wants to help our 12.5 million hard-working members. So I reached out my hand to Donald Trump in cooperation. I listened. I waited. I tried. And all I got was broken promises and outright attacks. Workers deserve better. We are demanding better. And in 2020, we are going to win better. So who will win our support?Look, there are plenty of people running for president. Some we know well. Others are new faces.But this election is so much bigger than any one individual.2020 cannot be about personalities. And it certainly cannot be about any one party.This election MUST be about workers.That means talking to us and getting to know us.It means visiting our worksites and our union halls. It means marching on our picket lines. It means learning about our hopes and dreams and understanding our concerns. It means being just as pro-union when you’re at the Farm Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce as you are at a Labor Day picnic.It means knowing inside and out how our trade, tax, labor and immigration policies have been used to batter working families. And being ready to fix them on day one.It means filling the NLRB, the Labor Department, every single government agency and the courts with champions of collective bargaining.We’re refusing to accept business as usual. Not when...in some parts of the country...it’s still harder to form a union than climb a mountain. Not when 40% of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for an emergency. Not when in the past 30 years, the top 1% has gained $21 trillion in wealth, while the bottom 50% has LOST $900 billion.But if you join us, fight for us and walk in our shoes, we will move heaven and earth to elect you.And together, we can put this country back where it belongs, in the hands of the workers who make it go.Listen, times are tough. But so are we! 30 years ago, I was in the middle of a strike against Pittston Coal Company. We had just endured Reagan. Union busting was the flavor of the day. There were concessions everywhere. And Pittston decided to come after the health care of our retirees and widows. Sound familiar? That nearly year-long strike—which we won with the help of the entire labor movement—sent a clear message to every union-buster across this great country. We are not backing down. We are not giving up. We are not going to take it anymore!Not long after the strike ended, I was sitting in the backyard with my dad. We were chewing tobacco and enjoying some time together. At one point, my father turned in my direction and gave me this look. It was the face of pride. He didn’t say a word. He didn’t need to. The American labor movement is finding that pride again. You see, workers are willing to endure hardship. We are the most resilient group of people the world has ever known. But what we won’t accept is the feeling of being unnecessary. What we won’t allow is for anyone to strip us of our value, our dignity and our worth.When Rosa Parks was asked if she didn’t give up her seat because she was too tired, she said: ”The only tired I was—was tired of giving in.”This labor movement is tired of giving in. And we are going to win a new day.We’ll march for it. We’ll organize for it. We’ll fight for it.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? Are you ready to fight?We’re going to fight for higher pay.We’re going to fight for better health care.We’re going to fight for a secure retirement.And, we’re going to fight for an economy where every worker—every single worker—has the freedom to form a union and bargain collectively.We’ve earned it, brothers and sisters. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We put food on the table. We care for the sick. We build the cars and mine the coal. We serve our nation with dignity and pride. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night!WE are the American labor movement and we will not—we will not—be denied! Thank you, brothers and sisters! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
165,Trumka on Future of Work: We Have to Get This Right,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-future-work-we-have-get-right,10-3-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a transatlantic conference with the German labor movement on the future of work: Good morning. Thank you all for being here today. Brother Reiner (Hoffman), I appreciate your partnership and your leadership. We have a lot to learn from each other. Just a few weeks ago, the AFL-CIO Commission on the Future of Work and Unions issued our final report. It was the product of nearly two years of exhaustive study, debate and analysis. At the back of the report you will find the proceedings of our commision, which included a very productive meeting with Reiner and our German trade union partners. Your process and your own report greatly helped guide our efforts. As our commission performed its work, it was clear that a generation of rigged economic rules and anti-worker attacks had awakened the incredible passion and power of collective action. Something is happening in America. Today is the 18th day of a strike at General Motors, where 50,000 UAW members walked off the job to demand that if workers share in the sacrifice, we should also share in the profits. In California, after a heated debate and the full-scale opposition of Uber and Lyft, the governor signed legislation clarifying that over a million workers who had been misclassified as independent contractors are really employees and should be given all the rights and protections that workers have fought for and won over the years. Working people across industries and demographics are joining together for a better life. Union approval is at 64 percent, the highest in nearly 50 years. 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in a generation. MIT found that more than 60 million workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance. This uprising comes as the astounding technologies of the digital revolution have the potential to improve workers’ lives, but also threaten to degrade or eliminate millions of jobs. In other words, we have to get this right. As you know, in the United States and around the world, stakeholders are engaging in a discussion about the future of work. So what makes our report different? First and foremost, it puts workers and unions exactly where we belong: at the center of every discussion about the future of work. And it also includes a serious self-assessment and comprehensive plan for rebuilding the labor movement from the ground up.If our commission’s work could be boiled down to one central finding, it’s the urgent need for an increase in worker bargaining power. Whether our future is one of shared prosperity or rising inequality, and social and economic dysfunction, depends on the strength of working people’s bargaining power.This is not our first rodeo. Times changed. Our jobs changed. And we changed with them, building a more prosperous nation and a stronger labor movement in the process. Today, we are in the midst of another technological revolution. While technology presents working people with the real threat of disruption, many analysts also predict that artificial intelligence and other advances will make Americans far more productive in the future, allowing us to produce more with fewer hours of work and create greater wealth as a society. If we make the right choices, we have the ability to conquer poverty and workers could spend less time at work while enjoying far higher standards of living.The most important question is whether the benefits of technological progress will be distributed fairly and broadly—or whether they will continue to be hoarded by the most privileged segments of our society.The stakes are enormous. A study from Harvard University showed that only 30 percent of millenials believe it’s essential to live in a democratic nation. 25 percent said democracy is bad. This generation increasingly equates our system of government with economic inequality and political instability. Meanwhile, the same bad actors who wrote our broken economic rules want to use technology to sideline the forces of justice and fairness—those of us fighting for a robust economy that lifts up all working families. They say the invisible hand of the market will work things out. But we know better. And our report demands better. So now, I’d like to walk you through a couple of key findings from our commission’s work to tee up today’s discussion. These are by no means exhaustive,  but they do distinguish us from the corporate-funded work being done on this subject. First, workers must have a real seat at the table when it comes to the design and deployment of innovation. We reject the assumption that the only question for working people to decide is how we should passively adapt to technological change. Technology does not fall from the sky. It is developed through public policy choices, and by businesses and working people in our workplaces and the marketplace.The unmistakable role of public funding in U.S. innovation policy provides a clear rationale for actively steering the direction of research and innovation to ensure that technological advances benefit workers and society broadly, not just a handful of private interests.The labor movement should continue to proactively engage with technology leaders early in the process of research and development, including through applying for federal grant money; exploring avenues for funding research and development designed to benefit working people; and exploring various models for ensuring that publicly funded or assisted research and development has broad societal benefit.At the recommendation of our commission, we will be forming a new technology institute to develop expertise and gain access to critical information concerning new technologies that may transform work and displace workers, but also can help unions more effectively represent working people. As part of this work, we will build on and expand key partnerships with universities and research institutions, like our commission’s exchange with Carnegie Mellon. This will provide us with the knowledge and capacity to engage broadly in the complex innovation process so technology is a force for good, not greed. Second, workers must have good jobs to transition to. Discussions about job loss caused by automation and technology tend to focus on training and income support for displaced workers. While these are extremely important, they must be part of a comprehensive good jobs strategy, and unions and collective bargaining are essential to making such a strategy work.Unions have been at the forefront of addressing technology-driven changes in the workplace, including job loss, for more than a century. The best solution for the individual worker who loses their job is to find another good union job quickly. Training, education and income support can play important supporting roles, but there must be good jobs readily available.So how do we get there? As Brother Reiner emphasized in a presentation to our commission, we must be very clear that full employment is possible if we make the right policy choices. If the United States invests the trillions of dollars needed to rebuild our infrastructure, we can put millions of people to work in good union jobs and maintain strong job growth. In addition, millions of good jobs can be created by investing, organizing and raising labor standards in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors. As delegates to our 2017 AFL-CIO Convention recognized, the fastest and most equitable way to address climate change is for labor to lead the way in creating solutions that reduce emissions while investing in our communities, maintaining and creating high-wage union jobs and reducing poverty. Third, I think everyone in this room understands that the economy is a global system governed by rules that we have the power to change. As our report concludes, the current rules of the global economy have failed us and they are unsustainable. Failure to rewrite the rules to benefit working people runs the risk of economic instability and political and social conflict. We cannot shape a better future for workers without tackling this problem head on. I think we all know the dangers of right-wing populism to our institutions and our democracies. We have to rewrite the rules of the global economy with a deep commitment to working-class solidarity on a global scale. We in the American labor movement understand that the fate of American workers is tied to the fate of workers and unions in every country.A fourth area our commission identified for potential progress is work hours. Predictions that artificial intelligence and other new technologies will make workers far more productive in the future have generated interest in the prospect of a “leisure dividend.” I know this is something our German friends have focused on extensively, with your metal union winning the right to a 28-hour work week for more than 2 million members. The idea is gaining traction here in America. Even if the predicted spike in worker productivity never materializes, there is a very strong case for redistributing work hours today—that is, for limiting the excessive hours worked by some people, thereby making more work hours available to those who want to work more, and giving all workers control over our time. Work hours can be reduced by bargaining or legislating a four-day workweek; earlier retirement; stronger overtime protections; paid holidays; paid vacations; partial unemployment benefits for workers whose hours are reduced; and the “right to disconnect” from digital devices and work. Most of these policies would redistribute work hours to those who have too little work.If working people can bargain or legislate more time sovereignty and a “leisure dividend” without any reduction in our pay, this could be a key mechanism to help ensure the benefits of technological progress are shared broadly by working people.Finally, and this is especially important in light of today’s toxic political environment, our commission challenged the labor movement to build working-class solidarity based on the struggles of all working people, no matter our background. At our recent Executive Council meeting in Chicago, America’s unions adopted a statement making clear that the labor movement must be the tip of the spear in the fight against white supremacy. The statement said and I quote: “With each new tragedy and outrage, we are reminded that a well-organized and united workforce is key to winning respect and creating safe and fair conditions that protect the lives and livelihoods of all working families. America’s unions will continue to be on the front lines opposing efforts to rip workers apart for profit.”The strength of worker bargaining power overall will depend on whether we are able to build inclusive working-class solidarity and prevent working people from being pitted against one another, a longstanding tactic of the wealthy elites who use such division to enrich themselves.According to the Census Bureau, people of color will become the majority of the U.S. population by 2045. The shift will occur by 2020 for those younger than 18. In addition, if recent trends continue, women will be more than half of the union workforce by 2025.The labor movement can be the place where all working people come together and no one gets left behind. Strengthening fair employment laws...adopting protections for workers who are discriminated against because of their gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity...comprehensive immigration reform....voting rights...civil rights...LGBTQ rights...a path to secure work and upward mobility for young people...this is the broad-based agenda that will build solidarity and power for all those who work for a living. Strengthening worker bargaining power overall, in turn, will help build a better future for those who historically have been excluded.There are many other ways in which our report is breaking new ground and approaching future of work issues from a fresh perspective. Whether it’s aggressively confronting a financialized global economy that is driving a race to the bottom here and around the world or regulating the misuse of algorithms, surveillance and data programs that violate our privacy and discriminate against us, it is clear that working people can and must shape our own future. Thank you. © 2023 AFL-CIO.

166,Trumka to Indiana State AFL-CIO: We're Not Backing Down,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-indiana-state-afl-cio-were-not-backing-down,10-1-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Indiana State AFL-CIO Convention:Good morning, brothers and sisters. Thank you, Brother Brett (Voorhies), for that very kind introduction. You have poured your heart and soul into our federation. In the face of right to work and a right-wing state government, you have rallied working people around an agenda of good jobs, great benefits and the freedom to form a union. Through old-fashioned solidarity and new tools like LaborKey and your very own Indiana AFL-CIO app, this labor movement is united, strong and growing. So on behalf of the entire AFL-CIO, I want to congratulate you, Brother Shawn, Brother Rob (Henderson) and Sister Uno (Blessed Coons) for a job well done.It’s certainly a great time to be in the labor movement. Workers are rising. We are refusing to settle for less. Teachers and hotel workers and grocery store employees are walking out and demanding better. From the Midwest to Silicon Valley, in industries both established and emerging, collective action is on the rise. Workers are using every tool at our disposal to win what we’ve earned. As you probably know, 50,000 GM workers, proud members of the UAW, have been out on strike for the past 16 days. I saw pictures of Brother Brett on the picket line in Marion. I want to all of you for your solidarity. So what are these workers fighting for? Let me take you back to 2008. GM was on the brink. It was going under...and fast. The American people rescued GM with our tax dollars. And UAW members gave up their own wages...their own benefits...to carry GM out of bankruptcy. They sacrificed and toiled to preserve an American icon.But autoworkers didn’t just save GM. They delivered years of record-breaking profits.Today, GM is pulling in tens of billions of dollars every year. Their CEO is the highest-paid auto executive in the world. So what does that CEO do?She closes plants.She outsources jobs.She stonewalls bargaining.She shows her workers the door and strips away their health care.She stabs 50,000 working families in the back out of all-consuming greed.Brothers and sisters, the boss is never going to hand us what we deserve. We have to take it.And guess what? After public pressure and a national outcry from workers across this nation, GM reinstated health care for its workers. We did that! That wasn’t corporate benevolence. It was worker power. And now it’s time to finish the job. UAW is showing us how to build a just future for ourselves. Their fearlessness is a reminder that the only way to fight back is by FIGHTING BACK.To every GM executive, hear me loud and hear me clear: Workers built, saved and rebuilt your company. You owe them everything you have.And until that debt is paid...we’re not going anywhere!We’re not shutting up! We’re not backing down!We’re going to march, shout and fight every day until our brothers and sisters get what they deserve!Brothers and sisters, I also want to say this: Once the UAW wins this strike and goes back to work, I sincerely hope they come back to the Indiana AFL-CIO. At this time of challenge and opportunity, we must stand strong as one movement and one union family. Together, we win.Because make no mistake, our enemies are relentless, well-funded and dead set on removing us from the playing field. You’ve dealt with it here in Indiana time and time again. In 2006, Mitch Daniels told the Teamsters he opposed right to work. In 2012, he signed it into law. In the years since, thanks to partisan gerrymandering, the Hoosier State has drifted even further into anti-worker hands.Prevailing wage was repealed. Businesses were given a license to discriminate in the name of religion.And what about the help you were promised from Washington? Here in Indianapolis, Carrier and Rexnord closed their doors. Donald Trump is nowhere to be found. And Mike Pence had the nerve to tell GM workers that the administration's new NAFTA deal—which has no way of being enforced and is unanimously opposed by the labor movement—was the answer to our woes. You know what, brothers and sisters? Instead of continuing to send jobs overseas, how about we send Mike Pence back to Columbus?And what about his boss? Trump told us he was our friend. He asked us to trust him. And now the circus is in town.Watching the news these days can be almost too much to bear.Americans are being scapegoated, minimized, dehumanized and told to go back where they came from. The free press is under attack. The very foundation of our democracy is being chipped away.Our nation’s welcome mat, long a beacon of hope for immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, including my parents, is being bulldozed and paved over, replaced with a clear message: “you’re not welcome here.”The president uses his Twitter account to demean and divide rather than inform and inspire. He routinely picks on the most vulnerable among us—women of color, people with disabilities, transgender Americans, immigrants—even Gold Star families.And what about the promises to protect American jobs, fix NAFTA and invest in infrastructure...what about the president’s pledge to change the economic rules? Well, he’s changed the rules all right—but not to benefit any of us.Wall Street got another windfall tax cut. His proposed new NAFTA is unenforceable—and companies are still leaving for Mexico. We haven’t spent a penny on infrastructure. Workplace safety regulations have been gutted. The White House is attacking union-registered apprenticeships. And just last week, the Trump Administration blocked nearly 3 million workers from receiving overtime pay while lifelong union-buster Eugene Scalia secured his seat atop the Department of Labor.When I think about these attacks...I get angry. But then I talk to workers. I stand in rooms like this. I march on picket lines. And I remember something my grandmother used to tell me. Stana tupe benne. In Italian, it means: from everything comes some good.I’ve been at this for more than 50 years...and I’ve never been more optimistic about the labor movement. At a time when our politics and our culture wants us isolated and bitter and ready to blame, working people are, instead, turning to each other. Union approval is at 64 percent, the highest in nearly 50 years. 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in a generation. MIT found that more than 60 million workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance.You are helping to drive that progress here in Indiana. Using his seat on the airport authority and working with our fire and police unions, Brother Brett won approval of an ordinance giving public safety workers the right to organize at Indianapolis International Airport. That’s how we put ourselves in position to win. And that’s why we are fighting to pass the PRO Act—Protecting the Right to Organize. The PRO Act would let us do our jobs without interference from anti-union employers or anti-worker politicians. We have wanted labor law reform for a long time, so workers can fairly choose to form or join unions. Well, sometimes you've got to knock on the door before you get in. We've been knocking. How many of you remember the Employee Free Choice Act? It was the first major piece of labor reform legislation in a generation or more, and we came up just a few votes short. In the years since that setback, the labor movement has never stopped educating working people and legislators about the importance of raising wages through fair and modern labor laws. The PRO Act is our strongest bill yet—and I have good news—it was just approved last week by the House Education and Labor Committee.The PRO Act protects the right to strike. It rolls back right to work. It includes first contract arbitration, substantial relief for workers whose rights have been violated and real penalties for employers who break the law.And here is one of the most underrated pieces of this legislation. It removes the employer’s standing in representation cases. The choice to form a union should be that of workers alone. They don’t ask for our input when making a decision about work. So they have no business attempting to influence who we choose to sit at the bargaining table.Rising collective action. Soaring approval. Successful strikes. The PRO Act. Brothers and sisters, something is happening in America.In the richest country in the world...at our richest point in history...workers are deciding that one job should be enough!That no one should go broke just because they get sick.That no one should earn less because of their gender.That no one should be fired for who they are. Did you hear that Mike Pence?Everyone should have a voice.Everyone should have a fair shot and a fair shake.And everyone should be able to form a union.Brothers and sisters, are you with me?This is our time. This is our moment. This is our country. And we’re taking it back for the people who work!Brothers and sisters, one of the single best ways to build on this momentum is by electing more of our own to office. At the 2017 AFL-CIO Convention, we passed a resolution committing the labor movement to this goal.In the nearly two years since, that’s exactly what we’ve done. We elected nearly 1,000 union members in 2018 alone.And under Brother Brett’s leadership, the Indiana AFL-CIO is getting in the game. It’s a program called Path to Power. You’ll be hearing more about this tomorrow from Sister Maggie (Koebbe), our National Field Director. A strong crop of union members won office in the last election. 6 State Reps. 2 State Senators. Seats on town councils and school boards. With Path to Power, we’re going to build on this foundation, putting our brothers and sisters at decision-making tables across Indiana.2020 is going to be the year of the union.And that includes winning back the White House.Look, there are plenty of people running for president. Some we know well. Others are new faces. Many are friends. For example, everyone in this room and this state should be proud of the campaign being run Pete Buttigieg.But this election is so much bigger than any one individual.2020 cannot be about personalities.It MUST be about workers.That means talking to us and getting to know us.It means visiting our worksites and our union halls. It means marching on our picket lines. It means learning about our hopes and dreams and understanding our concerns. It means being just as pro-union when you’re at the Farm Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce as you are at a Labor Day picnic.It means knowing inside and out how our trade, tax, labor and immigration policies have been used to batter working families. And being ready to fix them on day one.It means filling the NLRB, the Labor Department, every single government agency and the courts with champions of collective bargaining.The late governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, said you campaign in poetry...and you govern in prose. But for too long, our elected leaders have campaigned in promises and governed in excuses.Or worse.We’re refusing to accept business as usual. Not when...in some parts of the country...it’s still harder to form a union than climb a mountain. Not when 40 percent of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for an emergency. Not when in the past 30 years, the top 1 percent has gained $21 trillion in wealth, while the bottom 50 percent has lost $900 billion.But...if you join us...and fight for us…and walk in our shoes...we will move heaven and earth to elect you.And together, we can put this country back where it belongs...in the hands of the workers who make it go.We’ll march for it. We’ll organize for it. We’ll fight for it.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?We’re going to fight for higher pay.We’re going to fight for better health care.We’re going to fight for a secure retirement.And, we’re going to fight for an economy where every worker...every single worker...has the freedom to form a union and bargain collectively.We’ve earned it, brothers and sisters. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We put food on the table. We care for the sick. We build the cars and fight the fires. We serve our nation with dignity and pride. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night!WE are the American labor movement...and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!Thank you, brothers and sisters! God bless you! © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
167,Trumka to Massachusetts AFL-CIO Convention: Workers Are Rising ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-massachusetts-afl-cio-convention-workers-are-rising,9-26-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Massachusetts AFL-CIO Convention:Good morning, brothers and sisters. It’s great to be with you today. Brother Steve (Tolman), thank you for that introduction. Steve is...how do I say this...a personality. A combination of passion and humor and guts. He’s the Julian Edelman of the labor movement. From Amtrak to the Massachusetts legislature, from the Machinists to the AFL-CIO, Steve has dedicated his life to working people. Please join me in congratulating him and Brother Lou (Mandarini) on another four-year term. It’s an exciting time to be in the labor movement. Workers are rising. We are refusing to settle for less. And we are using every tool at our disposal to win what is fair. Earlier this year, when Stop & Shop proposed a contract that would’ve forced 30,000 UFCW members across New England to endure less health care, less retirement and less dignity, workers stood up and said NO! The strike lasted 11 days. The company lost millions. Customers refused to cross the picket line. And guess what? Workers won! The UFCW won! The labor movement won! We won! The fight continues. As you probably know, 50,000 GM workers, proud members of the UAW, are currently out on strike. They are standing on the shoulders of those at Stop & Shop and Marriott and all the places workers took a risk and drew a line in the sand.Let me take you back to 2008. GM was on the brink. It was going under...and fast. The American people rescued GM with our tax dollars. And UAW members gave up their own wages...their own benefits...to carry GM out of bankruptcy.

One union family! We’re going to march, shout and fight every day until our brothers and sisters get what they deserve!Brothers and sisters, when I think about GM’s greed...I get angry. But then I talk to UAW members and I remember something my grandmother used to tell me. Stana tupe benne.

Union approval is at 64 percent, the highest in nearly 50 years. 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in a generation. MIT found that more than 60 million workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance. And because of your hard work, we secured a groundbreaking win for public service workers in Massachusetts, overriding Governor Baker’s veto by a combined vote of 193-2! This legislative victory is the strongest response yet to Janus, the Supreme Court case that was supposed to knock us out but instead gave us new life, and it was carried by IUE-CWA member Pete Capano and other union legislators we elected to serve on Beacon Hill. From now on, if you get the benefits of union representation, you will be required to cover some of the costs. I don’t think that’s too much to ask!Our resounding override—along with progress on a $15 minimum wage, paid family leave and the Fund Our Future-led effort to increase investment in education—reminds us that the best way to win pro-worker laws is by electing more of our own, as Mayor Marty Walsh has shown us in Boston time and time again.  At the 2017 AFL-CIO Convention, we passed a resolution committing the labor movement to electing more union members to public office.In the nearly two years since, that’s exactly what we’ve done.In 2018 alone, you elected five union members to the Massachusetts House, one to the Massachusetts Senate and sent Ironworker Stephen Lynch back to Washington to fight for us in Congress.Lynch, along with his colleagues in the Massachusetts Congressional delegation, is leading the fight to pass the PRO Act—Protecting the Right to Organize.The PRO Act would let us do our jobs without interference from anti-union employers or anti-worker politicians. We have wanted labor law reform for a long time, so workers can fairly choose to form or join unions. Well, sometimes you've got to knock on the door before you get in. We've been knocking. How many of you remember the Employee Free Choice Act? It was the first major piece of labor reform legislation in a generation or more, and if not for the untimely death of your legendary senator Ted Kennedy, it probably would have become law. In the years since that setback, the labor movement has never stopped educating working people and legislators about the importance of raising wages through fair and modern labor laws. The PRO Act is our strongest bill yet—and I have good news—it was just approved yesterday by the House Education and Labor Committee.The PRO Act protects the right to strike.

Our union member candidates program. Brothers and sisters, something is happening in America. In the richest country in the world...at our richest point in history...workers are deciding that one job should be enough!That no one should go broke just because they get sick.That no one should earn less because of their gender.That no one should be fired for who they are.Everyone should have a voice.Everyone should have a fair shot and a fair shake.And everyone should be able to form a union.Brothers and sisters, are you with me?This is our time.

We haven’t spent a penny on infrastructure. Workplace safety regulations have been gutted. The administration wants to replace union-registered apprenticeships with industry-set training standards. And just this week, the Trump Administration blocked nearly 3 million workers from receiving overtime pay while Antonin Scalia’s son, a management side lawyer with a history of union-busting, came one step closer to becoming the Secretary of Labor.Brothers and sisters, enough is enough. We’re demanding better. We deserve better. And in 2020, we’re going to win better.But I also have a warning for the Democratic Party.We are not your ATM. You must work for us, not the other way around.We’re setting the bar high—higher than it’s ever been.Put plainly, my message today is this: If you want our endorsement...if you want our vote...if you want our support...then show us that you’re unambiguously pro-worker and pro-union. Tell us about your plan to make it easier to form unions and harder to bust them. Show us that workers are more than a section on your website or a line in your biography. Make growing today’s labor movement a top priority.The late governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, said you campaign in poetry...and you govern in prose. But for too long, our elected leaders have campaigned in promises and governed in excuses.Or worse.We’re refusing to accept business as usual. Not when...in some parts of the country...it’s still harder to form a union than climb a mountain. Not when 40 percent of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for an emergency. Not when in the past 30 years, the top 1 percent has gained $21 trillion in wealth, while the bottom 50 percent has lost $900 billion.Working people built this country from the ground up. We keep her running every day. Yet far too often, we’ve been disrespected, disregarded and abandoned. So, we are demanding from a president the same thing we demand of ourselves: Hard work. Integrity. Honor. Guts. Grit. And, sacrifice. It doesn’t matter if there’s a D, R or I next to your name. If you refuse to truly make the cause of workers your own, then we cannot endorse you.But...if you join us...and fight for us…and walk in our shoes...we will move heaven and earth to elect you. And together, we can put this country back where it belongs...in the hands of the workers who make it go.We’ll march for it. We’ll organize for it. We’ll fight for it.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight?

168,Trumka: Federal Workers Deserve Fair and Genuine Collective Bargaining,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-federal-workers-deserve-fair-and-genuine-collective-bargaining,9-24-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a rally in support of federal workers:Thank you, Brother J. David (Cox)! There is no tougher leader in the labor movement.Good afternoon, brothers and sisters.Are you fed up? Are you fired up?The AFL-CIO just met in Chicago. 55 unions proud. 12.5 million members strong.And we passed a statement. It said and I quote: “Federal workers deserve fair and genuine collective bargaining and representation free of any political agenda.”That’s our position. That’s what we’re fighting for. That’s what this rally is all about.Brothers and sisters, this administration is trying to crush our federal employees.The executive orders. The government shutdown.And now political hacks are tearing up union contracts.They’re making it harder and harder to have a voice on the job.They’re imposing collective bargaining agreements that aren’t collective, bargained or agreed to.If this president thinks we’re just going to sit back and watch our fundamental rights be destroyed, he’s got another thing coming.We will fight back in the courts.We will fight back in Congress.And we will fight back in the streets.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight?Are you ready to fight at the VA and the EPA and the Department of Education?Unions are on the move.Our popularity is at 64 percent, the highest in nearly 50 years.As we speak, 50,000 workers are on strike at General Motors. UAW members. They, too, are fed up. And we send our love and support and solidarity to every single one of them.Something is happening in America. Working people are refusing to settle for less. We are demanding a fair shot and a fair shake. And we are standing up to the bullies—in business and in government—who have held us down for too long.Every day, federal employees wake up, go to work and serve our country with honor and distinction. You carry out your oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.And too often, instead of heartfelt thanks, you get ridiculed. Vultures who want to profit from your public service tell us government bureaucrats are the problem.They want AFGE to simply go away.Well, brothers and sisters, on this day, in the shadow of the Capitol, in this country built by union hands and served by union heroes, I have a message for the president and ALL those who would harm our federal employees.Your time is up!Your days are done!You’ve met your match!We’re spoiling for a fight. I say, bring it on! We've taken your best shot, and we're still standing. We’re the true American patriots. We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united.And we’re going to fight for the men and women who empower our teachers...serve our seniors...protect our environment...and care for our veterans....the American patriots who keep our nation healthy and safe and strong and free.This is our country...and it’s time...it’s high time...we took it back!Thank you.

169,Trumka to Mexican-American Leaders: New NAFTA Falls Short,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-mexican-american-leaders-new-nafta-falls-short,9-14-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a meeting of Mexican-American leaders:Good morning and thank you all for being here. I’m looking forward to our discussion today. Thank you Bob (Reiter), for that very kind welcome. And thank you Brother Napoleon (Gomez) and Sister Libier (Gonzalez) for making the journey from Mexico to take part in this important meeting. The AFL-CIO was in Chicago this week to plan for the future. Leaders from our 55 unions, representing 12.5 million workers across the United States, gathered to map out a bold agenda to build power at work and in our communities. Our federation represents a broad cross section of sectors, industries and demographics. And much like your clubs, our unions know firsthand that we are stronger together than we are apart. As part of our business this week, we adopted a statement committing the labor movement to leading the fight against white supremacy. Our nation is being poisoned by hateful rhetoric and divisive tactics at the highest levels of government. America’s welcome mat, long a beacon of hope for immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, including my parents, is being bulldozed and paved over, replaced with a clear message: “you’re not welcome here.” In 2018, the U.S. spent $24 billion on immigration enforcement and only $2 billion enforcing our labor laws. That’s 12 times more to hunt down immigrants than protect workers. And the El Paso shooter traveled more than 600 miles to kill Mexican immigrants. It is not lost on me that any one of you could have been the target. I’m so sorry about that. Let me be absolutely clear: We are a nation of immigrants. We are a labor movement of immigrants.Our unions must provide sanctuary, and our contracts must offer protection where our laws do not. Immigrants can find hope and a home in the labor movement—as they have throughout our history. And we will not rest until every aspiring American can live here and work here safely and freely as United States citizens. We also adopted a statement this week laying out our standards for a new North American Free Trade Agreement. As Napoleon knows, I just returned from a trip to Mexico City, where I had the opportunity to meet with the Mexican president and labor minister. I also met with representatives of the independent labor movement, including Napoleon.My trip only served to confirm the disastrous impact of NAFTA. 40% of Mexicans are living in poverty. There are still hundreds of thousands of sham contracts that prevent workers from having a real voice on the job. And while Mexico’s new president is certainly a friend to workers, the Mexican government has yet to demonstrate it has the resources or infrastructure to enforce newly-passed labor law reforms. In fact, just this week, we learned that the Mexican government is actually cutting its labor budget. And because of President Trump’s ill-advised threats, Mexico is diverting troops and money to its southern border with Guatemala, routinely violating the human rights of citizens and migrants alike, instead of working to ensure workers can raise wages through free and independent unions.And what about here in the United States? Those of you from Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin know the answer. NAFTA has gutted American manufacturing. Earlier this summer, I hosted a series of town halls throughout the Midwest on this disastrous agreement. We had real, honest and powerful conversations about the damage NAFTA has caused over the past 25 years. Nearly a million jobs have been lost across America, and many of our undocumented neighbors came here after their livelihoods were crushed by the same raw deal. The beneficiaries of the current trade model want us to blame those neighbors, to pit us against each other in their never ending quest to leave us poor, divided and weak. But we know better. We know our enemies are the global corporations who twist the rules to benefit themselves. Not immigrants. And certainly not American, Canadian or Mexican workers. Workers are never the enemy! As we outlined in our statement this week, any NAFTA agreement that leaves Mexican workers poor and vulnerable and American workers jobless is dead on arrival at the AFL-CIO. The U.S. and Mexican labor movements are in lockstep on winning a new NAFTA that lifts up working people in all three countries. Simply put, the current proposal falls short. First and foremost, it is unenforceable. As I stated earlier, Mexico has yet to demonstrate the capacity to enforce labor law reform and eliminate protection contracts. In addition, the current text allows an accused party to unilaterally block the formation of a dispute settlement panel. That’s crazy! And finally, workers have no way to enforce the agreement, such as the right to stop products at the border if they are produced in violation of labor or environmental standards. Leaders in the United States and Mexico want to ram through the new NAFTA in short order. We are not going to let that happen without the changes working people across North America deserve. It is time for negotiators to go back to the table and hammer out an agreement that is good for working people across the continent.Any new NAFTA that doesn’t guarantee that all workers in Mexico, Canada and the United States can freely exercise our fundamental labor rights isn’t worth the paper it's written on. We deserve better. We are demanding better. And if we stick together, we are going to win better.Once again, thank you for joining in today’s conversation. I look forward to hearing from all of you.With that, it is my pleasure to introduce my brother from Los Mineros, Senator Napoleon Gomez. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
170,Trumka: Working People Will Not Settle,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-working-people-will-not-settle,8-29-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Christian Science Monitor Breakfast: Good morning and happy early Labor Day. As always, thank you to the Christian Science Monitor for hosting us, and thanks to each of you for being here today.I’ve been in the labor movement for more than 50 years. I’ve never witnessed a moment like this. I've never felt this much energy and determination from working people. I've never seen this movement so driven to take the future into our own hands.Working people are rising to meet this moment in history because we know something is deeply wrong. Our nation is being poisoned by hateful rhetoric and divisive tactics at the highest levels of government. People of color are being scapegoated, minimized, dehumanized and told to go back where they came from. Racist dog whistles have been replaced with megaphones. Women are openly degraded and discriminated against. And America’s welcome mat, long a beacon of hope for immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, including my parents, is being bulldozed and paved over, replaced with a clear message: “you’re not welcome here.”Meanwhile, the rich continue to hoard unprecedented money and power...while the people who build that wealth are working harder and longer...for less money...with less dignity...in harsher, more dangerous workplaces. Faced with the reality of historic inequality and rising bigotry that goes all the way to the top, the labor movement is offering a path forward lit by solidarity.In 2017, more than a quarter-million people joined unions—three quarters of them under the age of 35. In 2018, half a million people walked picket lines—the most in a generation—and nearly 1,000 union members were elected to public office—ushering in a series of pro-worker legislative victories throughout 2019. 20,000 public sector workers in Nevada and 100,000 farmworkers in New York now have access to collective bargaining because of our efforts.MIT found that half of non-union workers would vote to join a union TODAY if given the chance. That’s more than 60 million people ready to secure a voice on the job. And just as the labor movement is setting the bar higher than ever before in the 2020 election, fresh research from Gallup shows approval of unions at 64 percent, a nearly 50-year high.You see, America’s workers aren’t interested in slivers of change. We’re not interested in gestures. We need action on a scale that will reverse a generation of corporate government that has rigged our economy to enrich a few powerful interests at the expense of everyone else. And trade is a great place to start.President Trump’s biggest campaign promise was a new NAFTA. It’s a big reason why he won Michigan, Wisconsin and my home state of Pennsylvania. Yet his proposed replacement still falls far short of what we need. We’re not looking for a tinkered, rebranded NAFTA. We need to replace it with a truly pro-worker deal that uses the United States’ enormous influence and economic power to uphold the rights and dignities of working people here and across North America. There are a number of critical issues that we’ve continued to raise. But chief among them is this: the proposed new NAFTA is simply not enforceable. In particular, Mexico has yet to demonstrate that it has the resources and infrastructure to follow through on its promised reforms.Trade without enforcement is a windfall for corporations and a disaster for workers. We want to get to yes. But, if Mexico can’t ensure workers’ ability to bargain for higher wages through real unions, the entire deal is a non-starter.That’s why I’m announcing today that I will be leading a delegation of U.S. labor leaders to Mexico City on Wednesday to meet personally with President López Obrador.He’s been a friend to the labor movement, and I believe he’s acting in good faith. So, I’ll be sharing these concerns directly with him. I’ll also be meeting firsthand with Mexican workers to hear their concerns, hopes and experiences. We need President López Obrador to show us how Mexico will guarantee the right to raise wages through free and democratic unions. If that doesn’t happen, working people across North America will continue to suffer.At this point, I believe it’s been made clear that without the support of the labor movement—in the United States, in Mexico and in Canada—the new NAFTA will meet the same fate as the TPP.It’s also clear that while we can’t fix the economic rules if we don’t fix NAFTA, we also can’t fix the rules if we only fix NAFTA. In 2019, 2020 and beyond, the American labor movement will be engaging in a full court press to win a wide range of economic policies that advance good jobs, higher wages, great benefits and the freedom to form a union, starting with passage of the PRO Act, the most aggressive labor law reform since the National Labor Relations Act. Working people are fighting every day, with every ounce of energy we have, to reclaim what's rightfully ours. This Labor Day, we aren’t going to settle for anything less than what we deserve. With that, I’d be happy to take your questions.

171,"Trumka to LCLAA: Without Changes, New NAFTA Dead on Arrival",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-lclaa-without-changes-new-nafta-dead-arrival,8-17-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Labor Council For Latin American Advancement National Conference:Good morning. Buenos dias. Thank you so much, Sister Yanira for those very kind words. It is an honor to be introduced by the first woman and the first immigrant to head LCLAA. I doubt that I need to tell people in this room what a warrior Yanira is for the cause of working people. Our movement is stronger, and bigger, and more diverse today due to her tireless work and leadership, and I want to thank her sincerely for that. And I of course want to recognize the outstanding leadership of LCLAA Executive Director Hector Sanchez. Hector is one of the premier labor and civil rights leaders in the country, always pushing us to be clear and bold in our commitment to Latino workers and all vulnerable communities. Thank you, Brother Hector! It is good to be home in Pennsylvania. And it is great to be here with the leaders and activists of LCLAA. Earlier this week, President Trump’s top immigration official twisted the inscription on the Statue of Liberty, arguing that working people and people of color aren’t welcome in our country. “Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet,” he said. What’s more, in his view, that offer only extends to “people coming from Europe.” These words—and this sentiment—are simply un-American. Standing here, in the birthplace of our great nation, let us be absolutely clear: We are a nation of immigrants. We are a labor movement of immigrants. This country wasn’t built by people who came here with everything. It was built by families who started with nothing...who worked and toiled to build the greatest nation on the planet. We’re not just standing on our own two feet. We’re rising. We’re marching. We’re striking. And we won’t stop until every bigot dies off or goes back into hiding! Using the Statue of Liberty to batter immigrants is un-American, but it is also unsurprising. Our nation is being poisoned by hateful rhetoric and divisive tactics at the highest levels of government. People of color are being scapegoated, minimized, dehumanized and told to go back where they came from. Racist dog whistles have been replaced with megaphones. Women are openly degraded and discriminated against. And America’s welcome mat, long a beacon of hope for immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, including my parents, is being bulldozed and paved over, replaced with a clear message: “you’re not welcome here.” The El Paso shooter traveled more than 600 miles to kill Mexican immigrants. Let that sink in for a minute. President Trump didn’t start this fire, but he’s pouring gas on it every single day. He uses his Twitter account to demean and divide rather than inform and inspire. He routinely picks on the most vulnerable among us—women of color, people with disabilities, transgender Americans, immigrants—even Gold Star families. And just last week in Mississippi, immigration authorities came into OUR house to deport OUR brothers and sisters. These members of the United Food and Commercial Workers put food on America’s table, laboring in dangerous conditions and sacrificing for their families and our communities. Their only crime is working hard for a better life. And we will not rest until each and every one of them can live here and work here freely as a United States citizen. Under the leadership of Jim Kenney, a pro-worker mayor we helped elect, Philadelphia has proudly established itself as a sanctuary city. Let there be no doubt—we are a sanctuary movement. Our unions must provide safety to immigrants, and our contracts must offer protection where our laws do not. Immigrants can find hope and a home in the labor movement—as they have throughout our history. And all of us—together—can beat back bigotry with solidarity. Our movement is needed now more than ever. After the El Paso shooting, it was suggested that America is better than this. Sadly, that is not true today. We can be better. We should be better. And if workers have anything to say about it, we will be better. But there is no denying that America is falling far short of her promise. Two years ago this week, I resigned from the White House American Manufacturing Council after President Trump couldn’t find the words to condemn white supremacy and murder in Charlottesville, Virginia. And what has happened in the two years since? There have been massacres at music festivals and schools and stores and synagogues. Children are being separated from parents at our border...as families are cruelly imprisoned for profit...after fleeing the poverty and violence made worse by the Central America Free Trade Agreement. The free press is under vicious attack. Wall Street got another windfall tax cut. Workplace safety regulations have been gutted. And in 2018, the U.S. spent $24 billion on immigration enforcement and only $2 billion enforcing our labor laws.That’s 12 times more to hunt down immigrants than protect workers. Brothers and sisters, America is on fire. And the labor movement is ready to extinguish the flames.  I believe there is no better place to start than our decades-long economic policies, perpetrated by both political parties, that have deliberately torn America apart, all to line the pockets of big corporations. NAFTA is one of the worst offenders. The beneficiaries of the current trade model want to pit us against each other in their never ending quest to leave us poor, divided and weak. But we know better. We know our enemies are the global corporations who twist the rules to benefit themselves. The enemies are not American, Canadian or Mexican workers. Workers are never the enemy! Trade itself is also not the enemy. We support trade. For too long, if you opposed a trade agreement for any reason, you were belittled as a protectionist...a dinosaur...as not understanding the complex reality of a global economy. Even some of our friends told us we were fighting yesterday’s war.But our movement is trying to shape globalization, not stop it. We don’t question whether we should open up new markets for our products and do business with people all over the world. We question the trade rules—written by the largest and most powerful multinational companies—that leave too many of us behind. That’s not trade. It’s greed!The record is clear. NAFTA has gutted American manufacturing. Earlier this summer, I hosted a series of town halls on this disastrous agreement. We drove from Pittsburgh to Cleveland to Detroit. We had real, honest and powerful conversations about the damage NAFTA has caused over the past 25 years. Nearly a million jobs have been lost across America, and many of our undocumented brothers and sisters came here after their livelihoods were crushed by the same raw deal. Entire communities are being devastated. Some may never fully recover. But we recognize that the human suffering does not stop at the southern border. Just look at Mexico under NAFTA. Workers at new, state of the art tire plants report making $1.87 per hour. That’s one American dollar, brothers and sisters. Not pesos. These workers don’t make enough to buy the cars they’re producing...and the companies aren’t even selling the tires at a discount. They are pocketing the entire margin. It’s textbook exploitation.No wonder more than 40% of Mexicans live in poverty. There are still hundreds of thousands of protection contracts that prevent workers from having a real voice on the job. A more progressive president and recently passed labor law reforms provide reason for hope, but the Mexican government has yet to demonstrate it has the resources or infrastructure to enforce these new mandates. And because of President Trump’s ill-advised threats, Mexico is diverting troops and money to its southern border with Guatemala, routinely violating the human rights of citizens and migrants alike, instead of working to ensure workers can raise wages through free and independent unions. Brothers and sisters, any NAFTA agreement that leaves Mexican workers poor and vulnerable is dead on arrival at the AFL-CIO. The U.S. and Mexican labor movements are in lockstep on this. I am in constant communication with Brother Napoleón Gómez and Los Mineros about the importance of winning a new NAFTA that lifts up working people in all three countries. Simply put, the current proposal falls short. First and foremost, it is unenforceable. As I stated earlier, Mexico has yet to demonstrate the capacity to enforce labor law reform and eliminate protection contracts. In addition, the current text allows an accused party to unilaterally block the formation of a dispute settlement panel. That’s crazy! And finally, workers have no way to enforce the agreement, such as the right to stop products at the border if they are produced in violation of labor or environmental standards. The Trump Administration wants a vote on the new NAFTA ASAP. We are not going to let that happen without the changes working people across North America deserve. It is time for negotiators to go back to the table and hammer out an agreement that is good for working people across the continent.Bring us a deal like that, and we’ll support it. But if the president insists on a premature vote, we will have no choice but to oppose it.It boils down to this: some parts of the new NAFTA are better than the original and some are worse. But no matter what, any new NAFTA that doesn’t ensure that all workers in Mexico, Canada and the United States can freely exercise our fundamental labor rights isn’t worth the paper it's written on. It won’t be new, it won’t be different and it sure won’t help rebalance our economy or empower working people.Workers are fed up with a race to the bottom. We’re fired up. And, we’re not gonna take it anymore! We reject those who tell us the NAFTA model is “inevitable.” We reject a world of obscene inequality and choose a world of broadly shared prosperity. We deserve better. We demand better. We’re fighting for better. And, we’re going to win better—for all of us!Brothers and sisters, even with all the darkness in America today, I have hope. Hope in a labor movement on the rise. Hope in the nearly 1,000 union members elected to public office in 2018 alone. Hope in the 20,000 public sector workers in Nevada and 100,000 farmworkers in New York that now have the right to bargain collectively. Hope in the strength and solidarity of our North American labor movement. No one can shake us and no one can break us. We’re going to fight for higher pay. We’re going to fight for better health care.We’re going to fight for a secure retirement. We’re going to fight for immigration reform that protects workers, unites families and invests more in citizenship than cages. We’re going to fight for trade that lifts up workers in the United States and Mexico and every single country. And, we’re going to fight for an economy where every worker...from Philadelphia to Reynosa, Mexico...has the freedom to form a union and bargain collectively.We’ve earned it, brothers and sisters. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We clean the rooms and pick the crops. We fight the fires and lift the loads. We serve our nation with dignity and pride. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide.This is our time! This is our moment!WE are the North American labor movement...and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!Thank you, brothers and sisters! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
172,"Shuler to IUPAT: Using Technology Can Make Jobs Better, Safer, More Efficient ",https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-iupat-using-technology-can-make-jobs-better-safer-more-efficient,8-13-2019,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler's as-prepared remarks to the IUPAT Convention: George, thank you for that kind introduction and your partnership as a fellow Secretary-Treasurer, but also as a friend.And, Ken, I am inspired by your bold leadership and the groundbreaking work you’re doing as president of the IUPAT. Your entire General Board, leaders, staff and delegates should be very proud of what you’ve accomplished and I’m thrilled to be here and be a part of this incredible convention. I’m a proud IBEW member.As you all know very well, in construction you often have to travel to where the work is, so, the joke was that IBEW stands for “I’ve Been Every Where.” It feels that way even today because I travel a lot, which also means that I get to meet and talk to working people all over this country. People who are on the move, speaking out and taking risks like we haven’t seen in a very long time: Teachers from Arizona to West Virginia, walking out for the respect they deserve. UFCW members at Stop & Shop grocery stores across New England, striking for better wages and health care. Customers stood with them. Together, they brought the company to its knees! That’s the power of labor and community working together!And, hotel workers, members of UNITE HERE, striking at Marriott and winning raises and better health care and the right to negotiate over how technology impacts their jobs. That’s huge!We are seeing a spirit of activism and not just among union members. How about: Amazon workers in Minnesota who went on strike last month on Amazon Prime Day, calling for better working conditions and respect. Those warehouses are modern-day sweatshops!Google workers worldwide staged massive protests last fall, demanding an end to workplace harassment and fairness for all employees—whether they’re full-time or contractors. And, video game developers are joining together to fight for a voice at work. Developers are working 14-16 hour days with no breaks under insane deadlines. They need a union, too!As I’ve walked alongside these heroic workers and listened to their stories, I hear some of the same things you’re probably hearing back home: Paychecks are not going as far as they used to. Health care costs are skyrocketing and eating up gains at the bargaining table. The growth in technology is causing fears about the future and what work is going to look like and if jobs are going to be lost to automation.  Corporations are chasing short-term profits and no longer see their workforce as an asset, but instead, a cost to be cut. And that threatens our ability to negotiate good wages and retirement security. There are dangerous attacks on civil rights, voting rights and women’s rights. Combine that with the hateful rhetoric and growing division and the very soul of our democracy is being threatened. It feels like we’ve reached a tipping point. The systems and institutions we’re supposed to rely on aren’t working for us anymore. Especially our economy. CEO pay is at an all-time high: 287 times what the average worker makes. The wealthiest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, makes in nine seconds what the average Amazon employee makes in a year. Let me repeat that: Nine seconds. It’s hard to even imagine! And, Amazon effectively pays zero in federal taxes!While people like Jeff Bezos get rich, the rest of America struggles to get by. Forty percent of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for an emergency...40%. And more than 60% of Americans haven’t seen a raise in more than a year. Here’s the thing— after all that doom and gloom— the secret is: It doesn’t have to be this way. Economic insecurity is not inevitable. The leaders we elect make policy choices that can benefit more people...the 99%. And, we can choose to do better. But where do we start?Investment.How about we start with investing in rebuilding our country’s infrastructure?I don’t need to tell you that we should be spending our tax dollars on policies that benefit the middle class, fix our roads and bridges and put the hard-working members of IUPAT on the job in every single community across the country!This should be a no-brainer. It’s one of the few issues where business and labor agree. And, for years, we’ve heard both Democrats and Republicans all say they support infrastructure investment, too. Yet, here we are. Again. Still waiting. Aren’t you sick of waiting, sisters and brothers? I am!Because the livelihoods of working people and the future of our nation’s infrastructure shouldn’t be a partisan issue. Bottom line: It’s time for the federal government to step up and lead on infrastructure.So, call Congress! Tell them why this issue is so important. While you have them on the line, tell them it’s time to rebuild our country with union labor, Davis-Bacon and project labor agreements.Building our infrastructure will also help build our labor movement. More dollars available for construction creates jobs and means more opportunities for training as new people come into our movement.

Did you know the labor movement is the second largest provider of worker training in the U.S. behind the military?

That’s our best-kept secret. But it shouldn’t be! Not when the average young person graduating from college has about $30,000 in student loan debt—and can’t find a good-paying job. That’s why IUPAT DC 35’s program at Madison Park Technical Vocational High School in Boston is so incredible. The power of partnership brings together the City of Boston, the Boston Public Schools and the union and gets high school students into an apprenticeship readiness program, so when they graduate, they’re already on the pathway into the formal apprenticeship program and have a good-paying career waiting for them afterward. These programs are a model for the entire country, and we need more people to know about them. And in Philadelphia: A summer immersion program was created for students to learn about the construction industry, especially for those who’ve never even heard of apprenticeships.We need to do a better job educating the public about apprenticeships. The time is ripe for expanding this successful model into more industries, which is why this administration’s attacks on training and labor standards with these IRAPs MUST be defeated. Our registered apprenticeship programs and training centers—like IUPAT’s incredible, state-of-the-art FTI International Training Center outside Washington, D.C.—pump millions of dollars into the economy every year, training some of the best tradeswomen and men in the world.Our leaders should be doing everything possible to invest in apprenticeships and provide more people with a career full of dignity and opportunity.IRAPS have no place in construction. Defeating this is crucial to our survival. Everyone is doing a great job getting comments into the Department of Labor, but we only have a few more days to up the ante!Investment in training and education is an incredible way to demonstrate our value and relevance to the broader public as well. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve witnessed people who are anti-union change their minds when they learn everything our movement is doing to lift up workers and communities.I know Ken is passionate about apprenticeship and training and how it can change people's lives. Especially for women in the trades. He has always boldly fought for equality. I’ve heard him tell a story about his early days as a new journeyman and soon-to-be father and mustering up the courage to ask at a meeting, surrounded by men twice his age, why their healthcare policy didn’t include maternity leave? He’s leading the way at IUPAT to change the culture throughout the trades with major efforts to recruit a workforce that looks more like the world we live in. IUPAT’s work to push our movement forward on immigration and establish innovative recruitment tools to encourage more women and people of color to join the trades—like District Council 11 and Local Union 195 in Connecticut’s newly formed women’s committee—is exactly where we need to be. It’s crucial for our entire movement’s survival. Staying ahead of technology and automation and making it work for us is also crucial. And, IUPAT is a real leader in this arena. We know the days of tape measures and string lines are behind us. Now, we’ve got Building Information Modeling (BIM), a 3-D model process, to plan and manage design and construction projects.And, I understand you’ve rolled out virtual reality training programs like computerized sprayers and lifts, so workers can test the equipment out and train before ever stepping foot on the job site—saving time and money in the process. Bottom line: IUPAT is using technology to make jobs better, safer and more efficient. You're showing our entire movement how we can dismantle the myth that unions are outdated or out of touch—all while using cutting edge tools to help us organize and grow. This is something the AFL-CIO is working on, too. We’re challenging ourselves to learn and think differently about reaching workers with technology and in entirely new sectors, like tech, to show them the power of a union. Their jobs might be different, and their workplace might not be traditional, but they still need a voice and protections like every other working person out there. And, that means a union!So, this is a moment to be bold and grab our fair share. We are the most powerful voice for working families on the planet! That’s what IUPAT has been doing since its beginning, and it’s why you’ve made history along the way: From painting the Capitol Dome to installing the glass exterior of the new Apple headquarters, these are projects to be enormously proud of. You are proof that by creating and sustaining good jobs and training workers for the future, we can win a stronger, more prosperous America. We have a lot of work to do, but I like our chances. Our movement is changing, getting stronger, bigger and more popular with the public. And with IUPAT leading the way, we’re showing America that when we stand together, we win together. Thank you for having me today. Let’s get to work! © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler

Those warehouses are modern-day sweatshops!Google workers worldwide staged massive protests last fall, demanding an end to workplace harassment and fairness for all employees—whether they’re full-time or contractors. And, video game developers are joining together to fight for a voice at work. Developers are working 14-16 hour days with no breaks under insane deadlines. They need a union, too!As I’ve walked alongside these heroic workers and listened to their stories, I hear some of the same things you’re probably hearing back home: Paychecks are not going as far as they used to. Health care costs are skyrocketing and eating up gains at the bargaining table. The growth in technology is causing fears about the future and what work is going to look like and if jobs are going to be lost to automation.  Corporations are chasing short-term profits and no longer see their workforce as an asset, but instead, a cost to be cut. And that threatens our ability to negotiate good wages and retirement security. There are dangerous attacks on civil rights, voting rights and women’s rights. Combine that with the hateful rhetoric and growing division and the very soul of our democracy is being threatened. It feels like we’ve reached a tipping point. The systems and institutions we’re supposed to rely on aren’t working for us anymore. Especially our economy. CEO pay is at an all-time high: 287 times what the average worker makes. The wealthiest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, makes in nine seconds what the average Amazon employee makes in a year. Let me repeat that: Nine seconds. It’s hard to even imagine! And, Amazon effectively pays zero in federal taxes!While people like Jeff Bezos get rich, the rest of America struggles to get by. Forty percent of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for an emergency...40%. And more than 60% of Americans haven’t seen a raise in more than a year. Here’s the thing— after all that doom and gloom— the secret is: It doesn’t have to be this way. Economic insecurity is not inevitable. The leaders we elect make policy choices that can benefit more people...the 99%. And, we can choose to do better. But where do we start?Investment.How about we start with investing in rebuilding our country’s infrastructure?I don’t need to tell you that we should be spending our tax dollars on policies that benefit the middle class, fix our roads and bridges and put the hard-working members of SMART on the job in every single community across the country!This should be a no-brainer. It’s one of the few issues where business and labor agree. And, for years, we’ve heard both Democrats and Republicans all say they support infrastructure investment, too. Yet, here we are. Again. Still waiting. Aren’t you sick of waiting, sisters and brothers? I am!Because the livelihoods of working people and the future of our nation’s infrastructure shouldn’t be a partisan issue. Bottom line: It’s time for the federal government to step up and lead on infrastructure.And, rail safety. The Federal Rail Administration's ruling on two-person crews is unfair and unsafe. We need two qualified crew members—a conductor and an engineer—on every single train. Period. That’s why the bill currently in Congress, the Freight Safety Act, is so important. I know John testified before the House earlier this summer and did a great job on behalf of the entire labor movement. Thank you, John!We need Congress to pass the Freight Safety Act as soon as possible! So, call them up! Tell them why this issue is so important. While you have them on the line, tell them it’s time to rebuild our country with union labor, Davis-Bacon and project labor agreements.Building our infrastructure will also help build our labor movement. More dollars available for construction creates jobs and means more opportunities for training as new people come into our movement.

Did you know the labor movement is the second largest provider of worker training in the U.S. behind the military?

That’s our best-kept secret. But it shouldn’t be! Not when the average young person graduating from college has about $30,000 in student loan debt—and can’t find a good-paying job. We need to do a better job of educating the public about apprenticeships. The time is ripe for expanding this successful model into more industries, which is why this administration’s attacks on training and labor standards with those IRAPs MUST be defeated. Our registered apprenticeship programs and facilities—like the more than 160 SMART centers across the U.S. and Canada—pump millions of dollars into the economy every year, training some of the best tradeswomen and men in the world.Our leaders should be doing everything possible to invest in apprenticeships and provide more people with a career full of dignity and opportunity.IRAPS have no place in construction. Defeating this is crucial to our survival. Everyone is doing a great job getting comments into the Department of Labor, but we only have a few more days to up the ante!Investment in training and education is an incredible way to demonstrate our value and relevance to the broader public as well. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve witnessed people who are anti-union change their minds when they learn everything our movement is doing to lift up workers and communities.Staying ahead of technology and automation and making it work for us is also crucial to our survival. And, SMART is a real leader in this arena. Your new technology committee is a big move in the right direction. And, I know your apprenticeship curriculum is now entirely paperless, and you’re working on some other big changes for the apprentices beginning next month. I’m excited to see what’s next.And, I understand you’ve got virtual reality training programs—like a virtual lift—so workers can really feel what it’s like to be 80 feet up without actually leaving the ground...saving time and money in the process.How incredible is that?Bottom line: SMART is using technology to make jobs better, safer and more efficient. You're showing our entire movement how we can dismantle the myth that unions are outdated or out of touch—all while using cutting edge tools to help us organize and grow. This is something the AFL-CIO is working on, too. We’re challenging ourselves to learn and think differently about reaching workers with technology and in entirely new sectors, like tech, to show them the power of a union. Their jobs might be different, and their workplace might not be traditional, but they still need a voice and protections like every other working person out there. And, that means a union!So, this is a moment to be bold and grab our fair share. We are the most powerful voice for working families on the planet!  If we don’t seize this moment and leverage our collective power to organize and grow, then shame on us.  That’s what SMART has been doing for two centuries. You are proof that by creating and sustaining good jobs and training workers for the future, we can win a stronger, more prosperous America. We have a lot of work to do, but I like our chances. Our movement is changing, getting stronger, bigger and more popular with the public. And with SMART leading the way, we’re showing America that when we stand together, we win together. Thank you for having me today. Let’s get to work!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
174,Trumka to IUPAT: We Are Union!,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-iupat-we-are-union,8-12-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at IUPAT's 32nd General Convention:Thank you, Brother Ken (Rigmaiden), for that very kind introduction. You are a trade unionist to the core. You, Brother George (Galis) and the entire Painters and Allied Trades team are doing an incredible job lifting up your members and empowering our communities. You don’t just talk about equal opportunity. You make it happen. Your courageous leadership on immigration...your investment of resources and staff in underserved communities...and your election of the first African-American president in the history of the building trades…shows what you’re made of. The IUPAT is a big tent...where everyone is welcome...and no one is left behind. We could all learn from your example!  You are strong and growing in diverse cities like Nashville, Atlanta, Houston and Denver. You’ve brought this union back from the lowest point of the Great Recession. Today, an IUPAT card provides a world-class apprenticeship, good wages, job security and a dignified retirement. But it’s more than that. We are union means we are stronger together than we are apart. It means if you mess with one of us, you mess with all of us. The IUPAT journeyman who has voted Republican his entire life. The steelworker who lost his job to unfair trade. The nurse who worries about her son being shot by another student at school, or profiled by a police officer on the way home. The immigrant construction worker who is forced to hide in the shadows every time the government threatens another ICE raid. The gay or trans kid who wants nothing more than to be accepted for who they are. The coal miner who wants to fight climate change but also wants to keep their pension. This is our movement. We are union. We are America. And if the forces of hate and greed want to come after our members and our communities, they have to get through all of us first! We are living through scary and dark times, brothers and sisters. The recent mass slaughter of innocent life in El Paso and Dayton is weighing heavy on my heart. It was less than two years ago that a madman stood from a perch just down the street at Mandalay Bay and committed the worst mass shooting in American history. Since then, there’s been massacres at schools and stores and synagogues. And our political system—with its division and distraction and outright incompetence—has failed to deliver a coherent solution to this national crisis. Americans are being scapegoated, minimized, dehumanized and told to go back where they came from. Racist dog whistles have been replaced with megaphones. Women are openly degraded and discriminated. The free press is under attack. The very foundation of our democracy is being chipped away. And America’s welcome mat, long a beacon of hope for immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, including my parents, is being bulldozed and paved over, replaced with a clear message: “you’re not welcome here.” The El Paso shooter traveled more than 600 miles to kill Mexican immigrants. Let that sink in for a minute. In moments like this, it is easy to say America has lost her way. But I think it’s even worse than that. The forces of greed in our nation, both elected and not, are pulling America apart...deliberately and strategically...in order to line their own pockets. Dr. King called the labor-hater and the race-baiter a twin-headed creature. He understood that the guardians of the status quo want us poor, weak and divided. Today, they are laughing all the way to the bank.The cure for this cancer has always been the same: solidarity. I’m talking about real solidarity, not empty gestures and bandwagon posturing. The type of solidarity where the outcome is still uncertain, and it may cost you in the short-term. Solidarity is most important when times are tough and disagreements are strong—when it’s so dark, you can’t see your hand in front of your face.  How we respond to the challenges and opportunities of today...and in the days to come...will define who and what we are as a labor movement, as a nation and as a generation. Together, we are the strongest force for good in the history of the world. Apart, we are nothing more than competing tribes fighting over the scraps that fall off the table. Brothers and sisters, this is a moment for unions. We bring people together. We bargain contracts for all of us, not some of us. So my message today is this: If you want to change the direction of this country, if you want to beat back hate, if you want to save our democracy and win a new day for America’s workers, come join us in the labor movement! Brothers and sisters, are you with me? In the richest country in the world...at our richest point in history...every worker should be paid enough to support their family. One job should be enough! No one should go broke just because they get sick. No one should be afraid of dying at work or school or the mall. No one should earn less because of their gender. No one should be fired for who they are. Everyone should have a voice. Everyone should have a fair shot and a fair shake. And everyone should be able to form a union. This is our time. This is our moment. This is our country. And we’re taking it back for the people who work! Brothers and sisters, I want to take a few minutes today to talk about the president of the United States. He is not normally a big part of my speeches for two main reasons. First, attention is his oxygen. And second, our movement is so much bigger than one politician, even a president. But Donald Trump needs to be challenged, confronted and more often than not, condemned. Our labor movement is a family. And like most families across America, we don’t always agree. 37 percent of AFL-CIO affiliated-union members voted for this president. In the Painters and Allied Trades, I know that number was higher. Honestly, I’m not surprised.I wasn’t surprised that some working people turned away from a party that gave us NAFTA, taxed our health care plans and took Wall Street referees off the field. I wasn’t surprised that working people didn’t go running to a presidential candidate who called TPP the gold standard and said she would put coal miners out of business...and her running mate who is STILL one of the only Senate Democrats refusing to cosponsor labor law reform.I strongly believe the 2016 election was an indictment of political elites in both parties that for too long have embraced policies that hold down wages, increase inequality, diminish opportunity and ship American jobs overseas. In between his divisive and hateful rhetoric, Donald Trump made promises that spoke directly to working people. He promised to protect American jobs, fix NAFTA and invest in infrastructure. He ripped Wall Street greed and pledged his commitment to changing the economic rules. Well, he’s changed them all right—but not to benefit any of us.Wall Street got another windfall tax cut. The new NAFTA is still more NAFTA than new. We haven’t spent a penny on infrastructure and President Trump stormed out of a negotiation with Congress because his feelings got hurt. Can you imagine this happening at the bargaining table? Workplace safety regulations have been gutted. Trump’s appointed Supreme Court justices cast the deciding votes imposing national right to work on the public sector. The administration wants to replace union registered apprenticeships with what I like to call I-CRAPS. Let me be clear: The government should be focusing on actually enforcing our labor laws. Leave the apprenticeships to us! Just last week in Mississippi, immigration authorities came into OUR workplaces to deport OUR members. And Antonin Scalia’s son, a management side lawyer with a history of union-busting, may soon be the next Secretary of Labor. If that wasn’t bad enough, President Trump has spent much of his time in office tearing people down and ripping our country apart at the seams. He uses his Twitter account to demean and divide rather than inform and inspire. He routinely picks on the most vulnerable among us—women of color, people with disabilities, transgender Americans, immigrants—even Gold Star families. That’s what bullies do. The biggest gap between the last two presidents isn’t policy—it’s decency.But here is the good news. The change voters cried out for in the 2016 election can be found by standing together in unions. That’s why we are more committed than ever to helping working people win a voice on the job. And it’s why we are focused on passing the PRO Act—Protecting the Right to Organize. The PRO Act would let us do our jobs without interference from anti-union employers or anti-worker politicians. It protects the right to strike. It rolls back right to work. It includes first contract arbitration, substantial relief for workers whose rights have been violated and real penalties for employers who break the law. And here is one of the most underrated pieces of this legislation. It removes the employer’s standing in representation cases. The choice to form a union should be that of workers alone. They don’t ask for our input when making a decision about work. So they have no business attempting to influence who we choose to sit across the bargaining table from them.So we need to contact our members of Congress. Republicans and Democrats. Tell them to do their jobs so we can do ours. Urge them to pass the PRO Act at once! People want a voice on the job. Solidarity, the fundamental belief that we are stronger together than we are apart, is being embraced in every corner of this country. At a time when our politics and our culture wants us isolated and angry and ready to blame, working people are instead turning to each other. Union approval is at 62 percent, the highest in 16 years. 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in a generation. And MIT found that more than 60 million workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance.Let’s go sign them up! Let’s respond to hate with love!Let’s respond to division with solidarity!Let’s respond to fear with hope! Let’s respond to crisis with unshakable commitment!Let’s strategize! Let’s organize! Let’s mobilize!Let’s show this country what we’re made of! We are union! We are union! We are union! One important way the labor movement can win a brighter future is by focusing on candidates and issues instead of political parties.At our 2017 AFL-CIO Convention, we passed a resolution committing the labor movement to electing more union members to public office. In the nearly two years since, that’s exactly what we’ve done. In 2018, because of our efforts recruiting, training and supporting labor candidates, we added more than 960 union members to the halls of power. A Painters and Allied Traders member...Troy Jackson...is now president of the Maine Senate. And Congressman Mark Pocan proudly carries his IUPAT card in the U.S. House of Representatives. Brothers and sisters, we need to do even more in 2020. I had the opportunity to speak before the most recent presidential debate in Detroit. I let all the candidates and the entire country know one thing: the labor movement will not settle for a union-ambivalent Democrat. We deserve better. We’re demanding better. And we can win better. Better than a president who promises the world and then gives us the shaft. Better than Democrats who take our money and then forget who got them elected in the first place. Better than cookie cutter politicians who think a rising stock market is more important than rising wages.We need a pro-union president! That means talking to us and getting to know us. It means visiting our worksites and our union halls. It means marching on our picket lines. It means learning about our hopes and dreams...and understanding our concerns. It means an agenda that is unambiguously pro-worker and pro-union.It means having a plan to make it easier to form unions and harder to bust them. It means knowing inside and out how our trade, tax, labor and immigration policies have been used to batter working families. And being ready to fix them on day one.It means filling the NLRB, the Labor Department, every single government agency and the courts with champions of collective bargaining.And the first test of whether or not you’ll be a pro-union president is how you treat the people who work on your campaign. Show us how committed you are to unionism and allow your campaign workers to organize. Be more than just a neutral party. Be an active partner. Many of the candidates I’ve spoken with have already made this commitment, and so far, a handful of campaigns have secured union cards. I hope others will follow suit. The late governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, said you campaign in poetry...and you govern in prose. But for too long, our elected leaders have campaigned in promises and governed in excuses.Or worse.We’re refusing to accept business as usual. Not when...in some parts of the country...it’s still harder to form a union than climb a mountain. Not when 40 percent of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for an emergency. Not when in the past 30 years, the top 1 percent has gained $21 trillion in wealth, while the bottom 50 percent has lost $900 billion.Working people built this country from the ground up. We keep her running every day. Yet far too often, we’ve been disrespected, disregarded and abandoned. So, we are demanding from a president the same thing we demand of ourselves: Hard work. Integrity. Honor. Guts. Grit. And, sacrifice. It doesn’t matter if there’s a D, R or I next to your name. If you refuse to truly make the cause of workers your own, then we cannot endorse you.But...if you join us...and fight for us…and walk in our shoes...we will move heaven and earth to elect you. And together, we can put this country back where it belongs...in the hands of the workers who make it go. We’ll march for it. We’ll organize for it. We’ll fight for it. Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?We’re going to fight for higher pay. We’re going to fight for better health care.We’re going to fight for a secure retirement. We’re going to fight for modern infrastructure and UNION apprenticeships. And, we’re going to fight for an economy where every worker...every single worker...has the freedom to form a union and bargain collectively. We’ve earned it, brothers and sisters. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and paint. We cover the floors, fight the fires and lift the loads. We care for the sick. We mine the coal. We serve our nation with dignity and pride. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night!This is our time! This is our moment! WE are the American labor movement...and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied! Thank you, brothers and sisters! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
175,Trumka to SMART: Change Comes From Standing Together in Unions,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-smart-change-comes-standing-together-unions,8-12-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the SMART General Convention:Thank you, Brother Joe (Sellers). You are an outstanding trade unionist and a true friend. You, Brother Richard (McClees), Brother John (Previsich) and the entire SMART team are doing an incredible job leading this union forward. Your convention theme, “Focus on the Future,” is exactly what the labor movement must do in these challenging times. And quite frankly, we can all learn a lot from SMART’s experience. In an era where mergers are few and far between, this union found a way to come together and combine forces, building SMART into the powerhouse that it is today. It wasn’t easy. The Sheet Metal Workers and the UTU had different memberships and perspectives and real disagreements. But by putting egos aside and embracing your common values and common vision, you have positioned the members of SMART to win more at the bargaining table and in the halls of power. And let’s never forget Joe Nigro’s role in making that possible. Today, your apprenticeship programs are second to none. You are a force on Capitol Hill and in state legislatures across the country. Because of your leadership, New Mexico recently became the first state in the nation to require that fire control systems are properly inspected and repaired. In Washington D.C., you are the strongest possible advocate for modern infrastructure and rail worker safety. Your commitment to providing disaster relief within 24 hours is a model for the entire labor movement. Your capital strategies work exposed CBRE’s blatant misuse of mandatory arbitration. And your member to member substance abuse and mental health support program is providing hope and saving lives. This tremendous record of accomplishment was made possible through the combined strengths and expertise of the Sheet Metal Workers AND the UTU. That’s the power of SMART! As you may know, the AFL-CIO formed a Commission on the Future of Work and Unions. We have spent the past year looking at ways for working people to shape innovation and capture a bigger piece of the pie. President Sellers has been an invaluable member of our commission, sharing the details of your merger process with other union leaders and making the case for consolidation as a tool for building power. Brothers and sisters, you are very fortunate to have a visionary leadership team guided by Joe Sellers!I will spend a good deal of my time here today focusing on the future. But I simply cannot ignore what is happening right now. The recent mass slaughter of innocent life in El Paso and Dayton is weighing heavy on my heart. It was less than two years ago that a madman stood from a perch just down the street at Mandalay Bay and committed the worst mass shooting in American history. Since then, there’s been massacres at schools and stores and synagogues.

And being ready to fix them on day one.It means filling the NLRB, the Labor Department, every single government agency and the courts with champions of collective bargaining.And the first test of whether or not you’ll be a pro-union president is how you treat the people who work on your campaign.Show us how committed you are to unionism and allow your campaign workers to organize. Be more than just a neutral party. Be an active partner.Many of the candidates I’ve spoken with have already made this commitment, and so far, a handful of campaigns have secured union cards. I hope others will follow suit.The late governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, said you campaign in poetry...and you govern in prose. But for too long, our elected leaders have campaigned in promises and governed in excuses. Or worse. We’re refusing to accept business as usual. Not when...in some parts of the country...it’s still harder to form a union than climb a mountain. Not when 40 percent of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for an emergency. Not when 80 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, but CEO profits are at record highs!Working people built this country from the ground up. We keep her running every day. Yet far too often, we’ve been disrespected, disregarded and abandoned. So, we are demanding from a president the same thing we demand of ourselves: Hard work. Integrity. Honor. Guts. Grit. And, sacrifice. It doesn’t matter if there’s a D, R or I next to your name. If you refuse to truly make the cause of workers your own, then we cannot endorse you. But...if you join us...and fight for us…and walk in our shoes...we will move heaven and earth to elect you. And together, we can put this country back where it belongs...in the hands of the workers who make it go.We’ll march for it. We’ll organize for it. We’ll fight for it.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?We’re going to fight for higher pay.We’re going to fight for better health care.We’re going to fight for a secure retirement.We’re going to fight for the best transportation and infrastructure in the world where trains have two qualified crew members...a conductor AND an engineer.And, we’re going to fight for an economy where every worker...every single worker...has the freedom to form a union and bargain collectively.We’ve earned it, brothers and sisters. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We fix the roofs, ride the rails and lift the loads. We care for the sick. We keep America warm in the winter and cool in the summer. We serve our nation with dignity and pride. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night!This is our time! This is our moment!WE are the American labor movement...and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!Thank you, brothers and sisters! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
176,Shuler to APRI: Working Women Are the Ties that Bind This Nation Together,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-apri-working-women-are-ties-bind-nation-together,8-9-2019,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler's as-prepared remarks for APRI's 50th Education Conference: Good morning, sisters and brothers!Clayola: Thank you for your vision, leadership and friendship. To President Emeritus Norman Hill, Board Chairman Fred Redmond and the entire board of directors: Thank you for all that you do. APRI is in good hands!And, my thanks to Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bill McCarthy for hosting us in your beautiful state. Sisters and brothers, congratulations on 50 years of this conference. We owe you a big thank you for all your work over these years!Your theme: “50 Years Later—What’s Going On?” has me thinking about what’s happening across the country right now. There’s a lot of sadness, vile and hatred.More than 30 people gunned down in less than 24 hours. And dozens more injured. What senseless tragedies.Sisters and brothers, if there is one thing we have learned from these horrific yet all too common attacks: It’s that we cannot allow ourselves to become numb. We cannot allow ourselves to turn a blind eye. These tragedies must serve as a reminder of how much work we have left to do. How much we must heal...and repair our divisions. How much we need action and solidarity. As a nation and as a people, we are defined by our values.And, the labor movement is committed to our communities. Committed to being the voice of solidarity and unity. Committed to fighting for justice and peace. Sisters and brothers, we will not be afraid. And, we will not sit on the sidelines!Solidarity is our guiding light, and solidarity will push us through. Since our beginnings, working people have never sat quietly. We’ve been speaking out and fighting arm-in-arm for the future we all deserve. And right now, working people are rising up, building a movement of collective action:Teachers, walking out and rising up for better wages and respect on the job. Students, speaking out and demanding safer schools. Immigrants, refugees and native-born allies, standing up and showing the world that we should be building bridges, not walls. UNITE HERE hotel workers, taking it to the streets and bringing Marriott—the most profitable hotel chain in the world—to the table. And, Amazon workers, including right here in Minnesota, who on Amazon Prime Day went on strike for better working conditions and respect. Those warehouses are modern-day sweatshops. Their top boss, the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, makes in nine seconds what the average Amazon worker makes in a year. That’s insane! We must do better by these workers, and we must explore ways to grow our movement into different sectors, like Big Tech. I know you heard from the incredible folks with the Awood Center yesterday. Aren’t they inspiring? Especially when you think about what they’re up against. As much taking on a giant like Amazon is a daunting challenge, it’s also an opportunity to organize and grow our movement. To challenge ourselves to learn and think differently about reaching workers in the tech sector and show them the power of a union. It might look different. Who knows? But workers...are workers...are workers!And, I believe that the strongest, toughest, fiercest workers just so happen to be women!Just look at what we’re doing across the country:The Women’s March, continuing to lift up women’s voices to another stratosphere. #MeToo, demanding an end to business as usual; From Hollywood to Wall Street, to right here in the labor movement. And, a historic Congress that looks like the true diversity of this country, like rockstar Congresswoman Ilhan Omar! Let’s make one thing Crystal clear: Minnesota is her home! She’s not going anywhere! Sisters and brothers, the common thread in each of these movements is women. Working women. We are the ties that bind this nation together.In many important ways, things have improved dramatically for women in the past 50 years. When this conference began in 1969, you probably didn’t see many women in jobs outside of secretaries, teachers or nurses. Today, women serve as doctors, lawyers, soldiers, astronauts, and yes, as labor leaders. We run big corporations and serve on their boards.While no one can deny that progress has been made, there is also no denying that we continue to face too many barriers to full equality. A typical woman who works full time loses more than half a million dollars over her lifetime because we are still paid less than men. This is especially the case for women of color. Do you think that’s right? Do you think that’s fair? No!Say it with me, sisters and brothers: No!As President Obama once said: “It's time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a Mad Men episode.”As feminists and most importantly, as union members and leaders, we need to be standing up for all working women. So if we want equal pay, we need to step up and lead the way.If we want to have a voice on the job, we need to lead the way.If we want better, more flexible schedules, we need to lead the way. If we want paid family leave, we need to lead the way.And, if we want a bigger better labor movement, and you know we do, women need to lead the way!This is critical: The only way women and all working people have a fighting chance is if we grow our labor movement. Because unions are the way to balance the scales. With nearly seven million women, we’re already the largest movement of working women in the country. And, the Census Bureau projects that by 2045...people of color will be the majority. So, I come here today with a real sense of urgency. We’re facing a tipping point. And if we don’t take advantage of this moment of growth and change and activism and channel it into organizing our unions…then shame on us. Just as we are tackling the challenges of technology and automation, we must also use this moment to address underrepresentation. We must work to remove barriers to leadership for women and people of color and help prepare them for leadership positions. Our unions and our leadership must reflect the world around us. This is a time to take risks. To be bold. And, to get uncomfortable. That’s where real progress is made.This is where the labor movement is central, not just for women and people of color, but for every single worker in America. We’re showing all working people our value by standing up and fighting back against inequality, corporate greed and fighting for labor law reform and immigration reform. We’re fighting for civil rights and voting rights. More people will want to join us because we are fighting for them!APRI understands that. And that's why you are so important to this movement and to the future of our country.You’re educating. You’re organizing. You’re galvanizing. And it’s this formula that has led to so many successes over the years. You’ve rallied against attacks on public sector workers, including the women and men of the U.S. Postal Service.You’ve united against every injustice with the power of collective bargaining and with the power of the vote. And, you’re recruiting young people to our movement! I met one of your young leaders, Denicia Montford Williams, earlier this year when we served on a panel for the MLK Conference in Washington, D.C. Denicia’s parents, Melvin and Mary, who are long-time union members and activists, serve as both the executive director and president for the North Carolina APRI. After Denicia decided to leave a career in retail, she joined the family business, so to speak. Today, Denicia is leading voter registration drives, advocating for paid sick leave, living wages, a path to citizenship and LGBTQ rights.Sisters and brothers, we more women like Denicia in our movement. We need more women like Sister Katie Jordan, who at 90 years young, serves as president of both the Workers United Retirees Association in Chicago and as Chicago’s CLUW president. Talk about a ""she-ro!""And how about Sister Lovette McGill: An ILA member and president of the Florida Chapter of APRI who got a standing ovation at the AFL-CIO’s 2017 convention when she helped present a resolution on the need for inclusion and equality in our movement. Sisters and brothers, these women and their stories and accomplishments are why we need APRI now more than ever before! We know what we are up against, and we need to speak louder than ever before and lead our way toward a better future.A future that’s going to be won with the help of APRI!We have a lot of work to do, but I like our chances because when we stand together, when we fight together, when we rise up together, we win together!So, let’s get to work!Thank you! © 2023 AFL-CIO.

177,Trumka at Democratic Presidential Debate: We Will Not Settle,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-democratic-presidential-debate-we-will-not-settle,7-30-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks prior to the Democratic Presidential Debate: Good evening. My name is Richard Trumka, president of the 12.5 million member, 55 union AFL-CIO. Our organization’s mission is simple. We raise the voices of working people—the 99% of Americans who make a living by getting up and putting in a hard day’s work. We’re everywhere. We make this country run. We ARE this country, yet more and more, the economic and political rules have been rigged against us.Today, here in Michigan, an autoworker woke up with a pain in her stomach, terrified that she’ll be the next to lose her job to NAFTA.A single mother heard pundits talk about our great economy and wondered when that greatness would reach her paycheck. An immigrant worker was exploited and threatened with deportation for daring to speak up for safety on the job.A nurse watched another patient walk away from medical care they couldn’t afford.A coal miner worried about the urgent threat of climate change AND the urgent threat to his hard-earned pension. Today, in small towns and big cities, in factories and in offices, co-workers joined together, trying to make things better, fighting to organize a union, only to find their voices silenced by unrestrained corporate greed and century-old labor laws.America’s working people, even with all our differences, are united by a common dream. We don’t measure success by election results. Our pursuit of happiness is defined by working hard to live well, passing something better on to our children and retiring with dignity and security.Yet day after day, year after year and decade after decade, we have suffered countless injustices...countless insults to our dignity...all so the wealthiest CEOs could get even wealthier. Our economic rules have cheated us, and too often, our leaders have failed us. That must stop now. Workers are on the move, striking, organizing and bargaining for a better life. And we’re ready to do everything in our power to elect a leader who will make our cause their own.Tonight, all across America, we’ll be listening for a candidate who will use the presidency to make our country work for working people...a candidate who will defend and strengthen our right to join a union...a candidate who will finally bring the era of corporate government to an end. We’re not settling for anything less.Thank you. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
178,Shuler: Labor's Biggest Threats are Also Opportunities,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-labors-biggest-threats-are-also-opportunities,7-25-2019,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks at the Texas AFL-CIO's 60th Constitutional Convention: I am thrilled to be here in San Antonio to be with you all. I had to come here to escape the heat of Washington, D.C.—in every sense of the word! It’s been a week of over 100 degrees and humidity. It’s like Texas traded climates with us. So, I’ll thank the San Antonio CLC, especially Tom Cummins and Teri Ramos, for hosting us.I have been watching the labor movement’s work here in Texas, and I just have to give your president,  Rick Levy, huge kudos for the agenda you’re leading and your willingness to try new things. Rick, thank you for leadership and vision and for tackling the tough fights with a plan that keeps the labor movement fighting together.And, my thanks to my sister Secretary-Treasurer Montserrat Garibay for bringing creativity and fresh ideas and for your dedication to our movement.  And the Texas AFL-CIO staff, congratulations on an incredible convention you have planned. This is going to be a powerful few days! I know past President Becky Moeller is here. Thank you for continuing to be a force for good and for our movement! And, Linda Chavez Thompson, who is a source of inspiration. I know we have an all-star lineup today, and I’m the warm-up act for Ken Rigmaiden, so I better get started.And, I want to also give a shout out to the sisters and brothers of UNITE HERE Local 23, who work in this hotel. Thank you for your help in preparing for this convention!I come out of the IBEW, and our members in construction often have to travel to chase the work, wherever that is. The joke was that IBEW stands for “I’ve Been Every Where.”It’s a tradition I feel a part of, to this day, because I get to meet and talk to working people all over this country, who are speaking out and taking risks like we haven’t seen in years: Teachers from Arizona to West Virginia walking out for the respect they deserve. UFCW members at Stop & Shop grocery stores across New England striking for better wages and quickly bringing the corporation back to the bargaining table to secure better wages. UNITE HERE members at Marriott winning the right to negotiate over how technology impacts their jobs.And now, airline catering workers with UNITEHERE across the country—including in Dallas/Fort Worth —are demanding that “One job should be enough!” I just met with workers at the airport in D.C. on Tuesday for a massive rally to break the log jam at the bargaining table and demand $15 an hour and affordable healthcare. Is that too much to ask? When these airlines are raking in record profits?But, it’s not just union members calling for fairness and dignity on the job.You probably heard about the Amazon warehouse workers in Minnesota who went on strike on Amazon Prime Day, calling for better working conditions and respect. Google workers worldwide staged massive protests last fall—including workers at Google offices in Austin—demanding an end to workplace harassment. And, video game developers are joining together to fight for a voice at work.  I’ve walked picket lines and listened to our fellow workers who are fighting back. And what I hear from them are the same things you’re hearing back home: Paychecks are not going as far as they used to. Health care costs are eating up gains at the bargaining table. Downward pressure threatening retirement security. The hateful rhetoric and division is threatening our democracy. The growth in technology and how that will impact the future of work and the future of workers.  These are issues that affect every single working person. No one is immune. And, these common threads are being tested and challenged from every angle and around every corner.The only way working people will have a fighting chance is if we grow our labor movement.  Because unions are the way to balance the scales. I’m feeling a real sense of urgency about this. If we don’t take advantage of this moment of activism and channel it into organizing and growth of our unions, then shame on us. There’s a lot of talk that the labor movement is dying. That we are outdated, outmoded and of the past. That we aren’t changing with the times to meet the biggest threats to working people. Whether that’s runaway inequality, climate change or technology, I see the biggest threats we are facing as opportunities.The first one: Inequality. Is the labor movement a way to fight inequality? We know that the rules of the economy are rigged and are rewarding the people at the top. The 1%. CEO pay is at an all-time high—287 times what the average employee makes. The wealthiest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, makes in nine seconds what his average worker makes in a year.What do President Trump and Republicans in Congress do? Instead of investing in infrastructure and creating jobs for working people, they pass a big tax break that gives trillions in giveaways to the wealthy. They keep passing incentives for companies to ship jobs overseas, and they refuse to pass comprehensive immigration reform to keep hardworking people who have made incredible contributions to our country living in the shadows. We’re seeing parents separated from their children, in horrific conditions.  What happened to the American Dream—where if you work hard you can make a decent living and do better for your family?This is where the labor movement is central. We are showing working people that by standing up and fighting back against inequality, corporate greed and for tax reform and immigration reform, more people will want to join us because we are fighting for them. And we grow the labor movement.Another threat to working people that the labor movement is central to is climate change. Coming out of the IBEW, I know first hand how challenging this debate is. We all agree climate change is real, and we want clean energy. But we also need to protect the good jobs that have powered this country for generations. I came to Texas after Harvey. The devastation was almost too much to take: More than 100 lives lost. Tens of thousands of families displaced. $125 billion in damage. But, standing at the Texas AFL-CIO command post in Austin, I also saw the entire labor movement coming together: From first responders evacuating people to safety to health care professionals tending to the injured, and from power line workers restoring electricity to teachers teaching in shelters instead of classrooms.Our solidarity was on full display in the days following Hurricane Harvey. The entire Texas labor movement—every last union, every last central labor body and thousands of union members, retirees and allies—stepped up to help our affected sisters and brothers recover and rebuild. We know the labor movement has a unique role to play in this debate and to make sure that working people are put first. It’s not an “either/or”: Good jobs or a clean environment. We can do both! I was with President Trumka on Capitol Hill last week for an event with the Senate Special Committee on the Climate Crisis. We talked about the mineworkers in Southwestern Pennsylvania to oil refinery workers off the coast of Galveston and how workers in the fossil fuel industry have sustained this country for generations. We can lower emissions without lowering our standard of living. We don’t need more empty promises from politicians; we need investment in carbon capture technology, onshore and offshore wind energy and upgrades to our energy grid. We need to keep our nuclear plants open and running safely because it’s 50% of the carbon-free supply in this country. And finally, we need a GI bill for energy workers. We need a clean energy future that’s defined by good union jobs. So, what do we do?Where do we go from here?How can we—the voice of ALL working people, no matter where you were born or where you were raised—provide a way forward? We begin where our solidarity lives—in the workplace and in the community.We can be a check on corporate power, but only if we’re united. We can win good wages, great benefits and safe workplaces, but only if we do it together. We can build an economy that works for all working people, but only if we speak with one voice. And, we can provide a pathway for immigrants and refugees to be safe, to be welcomed and to stay together, but only if working people rise up, arm in arm and look after each other!I believe the labor movement has the power to do all of that. Because that’s what you’re doing right here in Texas!You are providing a path to citizenship for working people across the entire state. And Montserrrat tells me the Texas Citizenship Campaign is celebrating one year of incredible success by expanding to three new regions. It’s so exciting to see unions across industries and spectrums coming together to help working people become American citizens. This is a program that should serve as a model for the entire country. And, I’m told that there’s one person who has really made this program such a success: Jesus Perales! Thank you for all your hard work, Jesus!Texas, you are also organizing—and that’s why Houston was selected as one of just three cities in the entire country for the AFL-CIO President’s Organizing Initiative. This is a BIG deal! And it means unions across the state, and across industries, will be coming together to strengthen our collective power.And, you are fighting to create opportunity and bring more workers into our union family, especially young people. I want to give a shout out to the soon-to-be graduates of the Ruth Ellinger Labor Leader School. Congratulations on your graduation tomorrow, and thank you for standing up and becoming leaders in our movement and in our communities! And also, hats off to President Levy’s signature initiative—the incredible YALL program. It has been so exciting to see this effort taking off across Texas over the past five years—and also to see so many veterans joining our movement through these programs. That’s something to be very proud of!

Sisters and brothers, in so many ways, you are demonstrating labor’s value. Deep in the heart of Texas—a state that has never been union-friendly. A state that’s now trying to deny your hard-earned wins to raise wages and expand paid family and sick leave. But your work, your grit, your never-ending solidarity—that’s how we silence those who want to write our obituary. You’re positioning the labor movement for the future. The “future of work”. Ever heard of this? I’m trying to talk about it everywhere I go because this is the third and final challenge that the labor movement faces that I believe will be an opportunity for growth.Technology. Robots. Artificial intelligence. There’s a lot of talk about the number of jobs that will be eliminated by technology. Some reports that automation could kill 73 million jobs by the year 2030.That’s a scare tactic, and we don’t believe that it’s going to be doom and gloom because the labor movement has been dealing with technology and change since our inception.The key is making sure that working people have a voice in bargaining over how technology impacts our jobs—before it’s ever deployed. Because we all know the saying: “If you’re not at the table, then you’re on the menu.”This debate is something the AFL-CIO is embracing head-on. We aren’t burying our heads in the sand and fighting technological advancement because there will be a lot of positive effects on our work. At the same time, we’re also clear about what we don’t support: Technology that’s being used as a way to deny workers our rights, harm our jobs or cast working people aside—without providing a path forward to a better job for the future!Amazon is now expanding into every aspect of our economy—not just an online shopping portal. They are a shipping and transportation company. They’re in pharmaceuticals and media and film, grocery and meal prep—not to mention all the data they’re collecting on us and our members.But we can use this, again, as a way to organize and grow our movement. To challenge ourselves to learn and think differently about reaching workers in the tech sector and show them the power of a union. It might look different, who knows, but workers...are workers...are workers.We have to be bold and grab our fair share. We are the most powerful voice on the planet for working families—we can bring a worker voice to the debate and use our collective bargaining agreements to leverage our collective power. Sisters and brothers, we have two choices: To see these global trends— inequality, climate change and technology—as threats that could destroy everything we hold dear and just hope for the best. Or, to see them as challenges that we can use. To fight back, bring people together and grow our labor movement into an even more powerful force. Because we’re the labor movement! We’re problem solvers. It’s what we’ve done since our beginnings more than a century ago. And, we’ll begin here in Texas where you’re making people’s lives better each and every day!We have a lot of work to do, but I like our chances...because when we stand together, when we fight together and when we rise up together, we win together!So, let’s get to work!Thank you!© 2023 AFL-CIO.

179,Trumka to Washington State Labor Council Convention: This is a Moment for Unions,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-washington-state-labor-council-convention-moment-unions,7-25-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks Washington State Labor Council Convention:Thank you, Brother Larry (Brown), for that very kind introduction. You and sister April (Sims) have done an incredible job bringing this state’s labor movement together. That’s what leadership is all about. It’s great to be back in Seattle. This is a union town! I know you are marking the centennial of the 1919 Seattle General Strike. What a legacy. On Saturday, I’ll be heading to rural Virginia to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Pittston Coal Strike, a worker uprising I was proud to help lead. I carry those workers with me each and every day. I think about the courage they had. What kept them going—month after month—in the face of one of the most powerful companies in the country? In that same vein, what led an entire city to walk off the job 100 years ago? And, what is motivating teachers...and hotel workers...and Amazon employees to say enough is enough?I would argue the answer is solidarity, the fundamental belief that we are stronger together than we are apart. At a time when our politics and our culture wants us isolated and angry and ready to blame, working people are instead turning to each other. Union approval is at 62 percent, the highest in 16 years. 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in a generation. And MIT found that nearly half of non-union workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance. I got my start in the labor movement more than 50 years ago. And I’ve never been more confident in the power of working people.. Something is happening in America. You can see it. You can hear it. You can feel it.Yet even on our brightest days, it is impossible to ignore the daily atrocities committed in the land that we love. Americans are being scapegoated, minimized, dehumanized and told to go back where they came from. Racist dog whistles have been replaced with megaphones. Women are openly degraded and discriminated. The free press is under attack. The very foundation of our democracy is being chipped away. The courts have made it easier for politicians to practically handpick their constituents, instead of the other way around.And America’s welcome mat, long a beacon of hope for immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, including my parents, is being bulldozed and paved over, replaced with a clear message: “you’re not welcome here.”Some say America has lost her way. But I think it’s even worse than that. The forces of greed in our nation, both elected and not, are pulling America apart...deliberately and strategically...in order to line their own pockets. The Washington State Labor Council recognized this dangerous path from the very start. You warned us that the rise of right-wing populism would require a robust counter attack. Not on behalf of one issue or one group. This fight has to be bigger. All of us or none of us. Your work on Initiative 1000 is a reminder that labor and civil rights have always been intertwined. Dr. King called the labor-hater and the race-baiter a twin-headed creature. He understood that the guardians of the status quo want us poor, weak and divided. Today, they are laughing all the way to the bank. Donald Trump is a symptom of the problem. He capitalized on anxiety, fear and divisions that have been sowed by the ruling class since the dawn of time. They were alive and well in Seattle in 1919...and the coalfields of Virginia in 1989…and remain on every street corner in America today. The cure for this cancer has always been the same: solidarity. I’m talking about real solidarity, not empty gestures and bandwagon posturing. The type of solidarity where the outcome is still uncertain, and it may cost you in the short-term. Solidarity is most important when times are tough and disagreements are strong—when it’s so dark, you can’t see your hand in front of your face.  How we respond to the challenges and opportunities of today...and in the days to come...will define who and what we are as a labor movement, as a nation and as a generation. The steelworker who lost his job to unfair trade. The nurse who worries about her son being shot by another student at school, or profiled by a police officer on the way home. The immigrant housekeeper who is forced to hide in the shadows every time the government threatens an ICE raid. The gay or trans kid who wants nothing more than to be accepted for who they are. The autoworker concerned about automation. The coal miner who wants to combat climate change but also wants to keep their pension. Every parent who dreams of giving their children a better life. This is our story. This is our country. Together, we are the strongest force for good in the history of the world. Apart, we are nothing more than competing tribes fighting over the scraps that fall off the table. Brothers and sisters, this is a moment for unions. We bring people together. We bargain contracts where no one, and I mean no one, is left behind. So my message today is this: If you want to change the direction of this country, if you want to beat back hate, if you want to save our democracy and win a new day for America’s workers, come join us in the labor movement! Brothers and sisters, are you with me? In the richest country in the world...at our richest point in history...every worker should be paid enough to support their family. One job should be enough! No one should go broke just because they get sick. No one should die on the job. No one should make less because of their gender. No one should be fired for who they are. Everyone should have a voice. Everyone should have a fair shot and a fair shake. And everyone should be able to form a union. This is our time. This is our moment. This is our country. And we’re taking it back for the people who work! 

When it comes to putting unions front and center, the Washington State Labor Council has been a great example for the rest of the country. Seattle is one of the three cities we have chosen through our Presidents’ Organizing Initiative. I know Brother Larry and Sister April are very proud of this. Unions from across the labor movement are coming together right here in Seattle  to organize, win and support each other’s work.How many of you followed the strike at an Amazon warehouse in Minnesota last week? It was inspiring to see those workers take on this corporate giant and walk off the job for safe and reliable working conditions.That strike built on the progress being made for in Seattle. Amazon had been contracting out janitorial services for its headquarters to an anti-union third party vendor called SIS Security. Over the past few years, workers have consistently fought for Amazon to hold its security contractor responsible for better working conditions with the goal of organizing with SEIU Local 6. Well, in May of this year, the workers finally won when Amazon ousted SIS and replaced it with two unionized contractors. Amazon employees have also shown signs of standing together, embracing the type of solidarity and collective action popping up at Google and in the video game industry. Both the Presidents’ Organizing Initiative and the AFL-CIO Commission on the Future of Work and Unions are looking for ways to capture this momentum and expand the labor movement into these rapidly growing industries. But to be successful, we need the ability to organize on a level playing field. And that’s why I am so excited that your senator, Patty Murray, recently introduced the most important piece of legislation in a long, long time. It’s called the PRO Act—Protecting the Right to Organize. In other words, letting us do our jobs without interference from anti-union employers or anti-worker politicians. It protects the right to strike. It rolls back right to work. It includes first contract arbitration, substantial relief for workers whose rights have been violated and real penalties for employers who break the law. In other words, it makes the fight fair again. So we need to contact our members of Congress. Republicans and Democrats. Tell them to do their jobs so we can do ours. Urge them to pass the PRO Act at once! We are also going on offense to win a better, fairer, NAFTA. Listen, I know this is a city that has a long history with NAFTA and the WTO. And, I know how difficult these fights have been here, especially with some of our friends. Let’s be clear. We support trade. For too long, if you opposed a trade agreement for any reason, you were belittled as a protectionist. But our movement is trying to shape globalization...not stop it. We are working to change the debate by focusing on trade rules, the structures that, for too long, have killed jobs and lowered wages.This isn’t a matter of whether or not to trade. Of course, we should open up new markets for our products and do business with people all over the world. The real challenge is to advance trade policy that creates shared prosperity and makes the world stronger and safer. By that standard, NAFTA has been a miserable failure. Unfortunately, the current new NAFTA proposal being championed by the Trump administration falls short of what we need. It lacks any real way to enforce higher labor standards. A trade agreement that can’t be enforced is completely useless. Let me put it another way: Would you ever accept a collective bargaining agreement that is unenforceable? I didn’t think so. It is time for all three countries to go back to the drawing board and come up with an agreement that actually works for workers. Bring us a deal like that, and we’ll support it.But if the president insists on a premature vote, we will have no choice but to oppose it.Workers are fed up with this race to the bottom. We’re fired up. And, we’re not gonna take it anymore!We reject those who tell us the NAFTA model is “inevitable.”We reject a world of obscene inequality and choose a world of broadly shared prosperity.We deserve better. We demand better. We’re fighting for better. And, we’re going to win better!Protecting the right to organize and winning a new direction on trade is part of our broad vision a more united America. But for too long, we’ve been operating with the wind in our face. Every step forward is followed by two steps back.At our 2017 AFL-CIO Convention, we passed a resolution committing the labor movement to electing more union members to public office. And in the nearly two years since, that’s exactly what we’ve done. Just weeks after our convention, you elected Washington State Labor Council all-star and OPEIU member Teresa Mosqueda to the Seattle City Council. In 2018, because of our efforts recruiting, training and supporting labor candidates, we added more than 960 union members to the halls of power. And this year, that’s led to the passage of pro-worker legislation from coast to coast and everywhere in between. Brothers and sisters, we need to do even more into 2020. There are many candidates running for president. Some are new faces. Many are friends...even good friends. One is your governor. But, this election is so much bigger than any individual.2020 cannot be about personalities. It cannot be about friendships. It MUST be about workers. We must aim higher and demand better. Better than a president who promises the world and then gives us the shaft. Better than Democrats who take our money and then forget who got them elected in the first place. Better than cookie cutter politicians who think a rising stock market is more important than rising wages.We need a pro-union president!That means talking to us and getting to know us. It means visiting our worksites and our union halls. It means marching on our picket lines. It means learning about our hopes and dreams...and understanding our concerns. It means an agenda that is unambiguously pro-worker and pro-union.It means having a plan to make it easier to form unions and harder to bust them. It means knowing inside and out how our trade, tax, labor and immigration policies have been used to batter working families. And being ready to fix them on day one. It means filling the NLRB, the Labor Department, every single government agency and the courts with champions of collective bargaining.And the first test of whether or not you’ll be a pro-union president is how you treat the people who work on your campaign. So, here’s my message to every candidate for president: Show us how committed you are to unionism and allow your campaign workers to organize. Be more than just a neutral party. Be an active partner. Many of the candidates I’ve spoken with have already made this commitment, and so far, a few campaigns have secured union cards. I hope others will follow suit. The late governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, said you campaign in poetry...and you govern in prose. But for too long, our elected leaders have campaigned in promises and governed in excuses. Or worse. 2020 must be different. The stakes are too high, and working people are drawing a line in the sand this time. We’re refusing to settle for less in this election. Not when...in some parts of the country...it’s still harder to form a union than climb a mountain. Not when 40 percent of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for an emergency. Not when 80 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, but CEO profits are at record highs!Working people built this country from the ground up. We keep her running every day. Yet far too often, we’ve been disrespected, disregarded and abandoned. So, we are demanding from a president the same thing we demand of ourselves: Hard work. Integrity. Honor. Guts. Grit. And, sacrifice. It doesn’t matter if there’s a D, R or I next to your name. If you refuse to truly make the cause of workers your own, then we cannot endorse you. But...if you join us...and fight for us…and walk in our shoes...we will move heaven and earth to elect you. And together, we can put this country back where it belongs...in the hands of the workers who make it go.We’ll march for it. We’ll organize for it. We’ll fight for it.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?A century after the Seattle General Strike and 30 years after Pittston, we’re going to do right by those who fought before us.We’re going to fight for higher pay.We’re going to fight for better health care.We’re going to fight for a secure retirement.And, we’re going to fight for an economy where every worker...every single worker...has the freedom to form a union and bargain collectively.We’ve earned it, brothers and sisters. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We build the planes, fight the fires and lift the loads. We care for the sick. We mine the coal. We serve our nation with dignity and pride. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night!This is our time! This is our moment!WE are the American labor movement...and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!Thank you, brothers and sisters! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
180,Trumka to Utility Workers Convention: We Power America ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-utility-workers-convention-we-power-america,7-24-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at UWUA 31st Constitutional Convention:Thank you, Brother Mike (Langford)! Your entire team here has done an incredible job. Brother Steve (VanSlooten), thank you for your decades of service. I wish you nothing but the best in whatever comes next. And, what can I say about Mike Langford? From your days as a utility worker at the Detroit Edison Company to your leadership of this great union, you have demonstrated the vision and solidarity needed to tackle some of the greatest challenges of our time. Whether it’s your passion for life-long learning, securing an energy future defined by good jobs, rebuilding our infrastructure, supporting our veterans or being a voice for every single utility worker, you did the labor movement and our entire nation proud. And, your friendship means the world to me. Congratulations on an outstanding career and a well-deserved retirement! To the amazing members of the UWUA, it an honor to be here with you today. Your convention theme and its focus on protecting our legacy and building our future could not be more timely. The resolution Brother Mike just presented is exactly where our labor movement needs to be. We will defend ourselves from attacks. And we will also go on offense to win new rights and break new ground. We will protect the jobs we have. And we will use our unmatched infrastructure and resources to create new jobs. Good jobs. Union jobs. We will support the members currently in our ranks. And we will make our case to a new generation of workers that are younger and more diverse, but just as hungry for a voice on the job. That’s how we build a 21st century labor movement. I got my start in the labor movement more than 50 years ago. And I’ve never been more excited than I am today. Union approval is at 62 percent, the highest in 16 years. 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in three decades. And MIT found that nearly half of non-union workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance. That’s more than 60 million people. Something is happening in America. Working people are rejecting an economy that leaves too many of us behind. I look around this room, and I remember why I’m in this fight. We turn bad jobs into good jobs. And, we turn good jobs into great jobs. We don’t do it for the money or the glory, the fame or the fortune. We do it because someone did it for us, and before that, someone did it for them. We do it because we’re called to. That’s who we are. We’re trade unionists. For 75 years, the UWUA has shown us how it’s done. You’ve provided utility workers with a pathway to the middle class and beyond. And, you’ve provided a pathway out of darkness for our communities. Literally. You got New York and New Jersey back online after Sandy. You helped rebuild Puerto Rico after Maria. Your Power for America Training Trust, a joint project of labor AND management, has given members the opportunity to learn and grow into the jobs of today and tomorrow. You’ve advocated forcefully for the modernization of our utility infrastructure which is good for our economy and our environment. And I know Brother Mike is especially proud of this one: Your Utility Workers Military Assistance Program has successfully trained more than 700 veterans for jobs in the industry. This includes a combat veteran and single mother of two in Chicago who was living in her car with little hope, and because of UMAP, she now has a job, her children have bright futures and she is serving as a mentor to new veterans in the program. This is the America we can...and must...win for all of us. Teachers and nurses, linemen and hotel workers, public and private, rural and urban, men and women, black and white, gay and straight, immigrant and native-born.Brothers and sisters, are you with me? In the richest country in the world...at our richest point in history...every worker should be paid enough to support their family. One job should be enough! No one should ever go broke just because they get sick.No one should ever be paid less because of their gender. No one should ever be fired for who they are. No one should ever die on the job!Everyone should have a voice. Everyone should have a fair shot and a fair shake. And everyone should be able to form a union. This is our time. This is our moment. This is our country. And we’re taking it back for the people who work! One way we’re going to win a brighter future is by shaping the debate on energy. You know this because UWUA has been at the forefront, leading those tough discussions with environmental groups, putting a union stamp on the fight against climate change, showing that we can protect the environment AND create good-paying union jobs. It’s not an either-or. It’s a yes-and.So when I hear terms like “just transition”...I must ask this: Does your plan for fighting climate change ask more from sick, retired coal miners than it does from you and your family? If it does, then you need to think again. Climate strategies that leave coal miners’ pension funds bankrupt...utility workers unemployed...construction workers making less than they do now...plans that devastate communities today, while offering vague promises about the future…are not worthy of the American heroes who build and power this country every day. But I want to be absolutely clear: We remain committed to the task of stopping runaway climate change. I say “we remain” because as the fight against climate change has taken on increased urgency, the labor movement ...in the United States and around the world...has supported urgent action. We supported the last real comprehensive climate bill, Waxman-Markey. We supported the Paris Accord, and we opposed President Trump’s destructive decision to withdraw from itAnd, for the first time ever, at our convention in 2017, with the outspoken support of the UWUA and other unions in the energy sector...the AFL-CIO passed a climate resolution.Our resolution strongly asserts that the fastest and most equitable way to address climate change is for labor to be at the center of creating solutions that reduce emissions...while investing in our communities, maintaining and creating high-wage union jobs and combating poverty.And if we are truly going to focus on reducing emissions, then we must be open to all methods of clean energy—including nuclear and carbon capture and sequestration.So if Congress wants to pass a climate bill, I’m all ears. But any proposal that doesn’t include high labor standards, raising wages and good union jobs is dead on arrival.One important way we can create more good jobs in America is by passing the most important piece of legislation to be introduced in a long, long time. It’s called the PRO Act—Protecting the Right to Organize. In other words, letting us do our jobs without interference from anti-union employers or anti-worker politicians.It protects the right to strike. It rolls back right to work. It includes first contract arbitration, substantial relief for workers whose rights have been violated and real penalties for employers who break the law.If President Trump wants to build an economy that’s good for workers and not just Wall Street, he should stop giving tax cuts to corporations and the 1%, and demand that Congress send him the PRO Act today.Protecting the right to organize is part of our broad vision for a better America.To get there, we need to keep electing pro-worker candidates.At our 2017 AFL-CIO Convention, we passed a resolution committing the labor movement to electing more union members to public office.And in 2018, we did it.Because of our efforts recruiting, training and supporting these candidates, nearly 1,000 additional union members are at the decision making table today. And that’s led to the passage of pro-worker legislation from coast to coast and everywhere in between.Brothers and sisters, we need to carry this momentum into 2020.There are many candidates running for president. Some are new faces. Many are friends...even good friends. But, this election is so much bigger than any individual.2020 cannot be about personalities. It MUST be about workers.That means talking to us and getting to know us. It means visiting our worksites and our union halls. It means marching on our picket lines. It means learning about our hopes and dreams...and understanding our concerns.It means an agenda that is unambiguously pro-worker and pro-union. It means having a plan to make it easier to form unions and harder to bust them. It means knowing inside and out how our trade, tax, labor and immigration policies have been used to batter working families. And being ready to fix them on day one. It means not just talking about infrastructure, but actually getting the job done. It means a responsible approach to energy, supporting a new NAFTA that actually works for working people, championing a Workers’ Bill of Rights and rallying support for the PRO Act. It means filling the NLRB, the Labor Department, every single government agency and the courts with champions of collective bargaining.And the first test of whether or not you’ll be a pro-union president is how you treat the people who work on your campaign. So, here’s my message to every candidate for president: Show us how committed you are to unionism and allow your campaign workers to organize.

181,Shuler: ILA Makes This Country Move,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-ila-makes-country-move,7-23-2019,"The following are AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler's prepared remarks at the 55th Quadrennial Convention of the International Longshoremen's Association: President (Harold) Daggett, thank you for the kind introduction, and, of course, for your incredible leadership. And, for recruiting Dennis to our movement. Although, with three proud generations of longshoremen before you, Dennis, you didn’t have much of a choice but to join the family business. And, we’re all so glad you did. Thank you for your work to bring new ideas and strategies to our movement. Thinking outside the box is crucial for us. To my fellow Secretary-Treasurer, Stephen (Knott), I’m always glad to be in your company and to learn from you. And, to the entire leadership team of this great union, thank you for having me with you today. Sisters and brothers, I loved being in Puerto Rico with you at your convention four years ago, when poor Harold spoke with a hoarse voice for about an hour. Remember that? Well, it’s an honor to be back with you again today!Talking to folks this morning has been a great reminder that the ILA makes this country move, and we should never take your work for granted!You prove that even with this pervasive narrative in our country about the virtues of “rugged individualism” and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps, we know our country and our people are stronger when we stand together. No one knows this better than the labor movement, and especially the ILA. Jeff Davis wasn’t kidding when he said ILA stands for “I Love America.” I travel a lot for my job, and I get to meet working people all across the country and let me tell you: Nobody is more proudly patriotic than the ILA. It’s simply who you are. It’s in your DNA. And, we’re grateful to you for that!You’d also be hard-pressed to find another union with a better sense of solidarity and generosity. I saw this firsthand a few years ago after Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.I specifically remember your work to help in Puerto Rico...stocking two 40-foot containers outside the NYSA-ILA Training Center in New Jersey with generators, batteries, blankets, food...you name it, it was probably in there! I should also mention that these containers were donated by Integrated/C&C Company. Our thanks to them!But your generosity didn’t stop there. You also raised $200,000 to donate to victims of all the hurricanes. That’s real solidarity. That’s what being a union member is all about. It’s not just getting the job done, calling it a day and going home. It’s about caring for our fellow members AND our communities. It’s about making life better, not just for ourselves and our families, but for our friends, colleagues and neighbors. President Trumka mentioned yesterday that our popularity is at a nearly 20-year high. And, if you’ve seen the news lately, it’s not hard to figure out why. Workers are speaking out and taking risks like we haven’t seen in years: Teachers from Arizona to West Virginia walked out for the respect they deserve. UNITE HERE members at Marriott demanded that “One job should be enough” and won the right to negotiate over how technology impacts their jobs. And, UFCW members at Stop & Shop grocery stores across New England quickly brought the corporation back to the bargaining table and secured better wages after walking out this spring. But, it’s not just union members calling for a fair return on work.You probably heard about the Amazon fulfillment center employees in Minnesota who went on strike on Amazon Prime Day, calling for better working conditions and respect on the job. Google workers worldwide staged massive protests last fall, demanding an end to workplace harassment. And, video game developers are joining together to fight for a voice at work.  When working people organically rise up together and demand fairness, justice and respect,  the labor movement must pay attention.How do we reach these people who see our value and want to join us, but don’t know the next steps?How do we grow unions in emerging industries?And, how do we make workers see our relevancy as the future of work changes?But too often, when I go to meetings with corporations, government and academia on the future of work, I’m the only labor voice in the room…which is frustrating because let’s face it: There is no future of work without workers!Working people absolutely should have a voice in bargaining over how technology impacts our jobs—before it’s ever deployed. Because we all know the saying: “If you’re not at the table, then you’re on the menu.”These are things that I don’t think our movement talks about enough, and frankly, we need to take a page out of the ILA’s playbook—the same guide that helped Harold and his top-drawer team secure a groundbreaking master contract last fall. Kudos on that! I’m also really impressed with how Harold and the ILA have handled the impact of technology and automation at the bargaining table—which is exactly how and where it needs to be done. This debate is something the AFL-CIO has been squarely involved in since our 2017 convention...when we set out to chart a path forward for the labor movement and ask the big questions:What’s our role in the future workplace, and what do our jobs look like?What does a mutually beneficial and productive labor-management partnership look like in the future? This is also something else we could all learn from you! And, how do we ensure that the benefits are shared, not just concentrated at the top?This isn’t a new arena for the labor movement. We’ve historically embraced new technology, innovation and cutting edge advancements, not because we have to, but because we want to help improve people’s lives and create better products and services. At the same time, we’re also clear about what we don’t support: Technology that’s being used as a way to deny workers our rights, harm our jobs, or cast working people aside...without providing a path forward to a better job for the future!The AFL-CIO Future of Work and Unions Commission is debating this now—and will be releasing our recommendations later this fall about how best to position working people to capture the benefits of technology, and create a dynamic and modern labor movement that gives workers power in the rapidly changing economy.But, shaping the future of work is only one step. If we want to grow our movement, we need to organize, organize, organize! And achieving that...means reforming our outdated and ineffective labor laws. I know President Trumka told you about the PRO Act yesterday, but this is something you’re going to be hearing about a lot. And, for good reason!This bill is perhaps more important than any other bill in our generation. The PRO Act would protect the right to organize and form a union. I’ll repeat that: The RIGHT to form a union! It’s the bill we’ve been waiting for, and we have to do everything in our power to make sure it becomes law. So, when you get back home, talk to your friends, neighbors and colleagues about the PRO Act, and then call your members of Congress. This is a big deal. With the PRO Act, we’ve got a real shot at changing the future for working people. It will help us fend off the relentless attacks on our rights at work, and it would turn back right to work. And once the PRO Act is signed into law, we’ll have even more momentum to tackle other anti-worker attacks. We’ll stop efforts to gut the Jones Act and defeat the anti-worker, anti-American port protection bills that have no place in our country!Our future is bright—and the ILA is a big reason why. You’ve shown foresight in preparing workers for automation. You bargained the landmark master contract last fall. And, you take risks as America’s first line of defense at our nation’s ports. This union has always put country above anything else. From port to port, you have made people’s lives better.That’s the goal our entire movement is working toward. We have a lot of work to do, but I like our chances. Our movement is changing, and with the ILA leading the way, we’re getting stronger, bigger and more popular with the public. We’re showing America that when we stand together, we win together. Thank you, and let’s get to work!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
182,Shuler Calls for Action on Federal Infrastructure Policy,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-calls-action-federal-infrastructure-policy,7-22-2019,"The following are AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler's prepared remarks for the IUOE Legislative Policy Conference:Thank you, President (Jim) Callahan, for that very kind introduction. It has been incredible to watch you bring such clear direction and laser focus to the Operating Engineers. To my fellow Secretary-Treasurer, Brian Hickey, thank you for your camaraderie and friendship in the trenches, along with the entire General Executive Board for your vision and dedication to our movement. We are in good hands. Good morning, sisters and brothers! It’s so good to be with you today. I bring greetings from the 12.5 million working people of the AFL-CIO, who are standing with me in spirit on this stage, fighting the fights and celebrating the victories alongside you.I’m a proud IBEW member. Travelers in our union sometimes joke that IBEW stands for “I’ve Been Every Where.” And, these past few years, it’s really felt that way—from Portland to Poughkeepsie to Puerto Rico—and so many places in between. As I travel the country, I’m excited to see that construction is booming, creating good, middle-class union jobs—jobs that allow you to provide for your family and live with dignity. I’m also excited to see that there are new union members in non-traditional industries, like museums. I’m talking about the 140 employees at the Guggenheim Museum in New York who are now proud card-carrying members of IUOE Local 30! Give it up for that victory!And, I’m excited to see workers speaking out and taking risks like we haven’t seen in years: Teachers from Arizona to West Virginia walked out for the respect they deserve. UNITE HERE members at Marriott demanded that “One job should be enough” and won the right to negotiate over how technology impacts their jobs. And, UFCW members at Stop & Shop grocery stores across New England quickly brought the corporation back to the bargaining table and secured better wages after walking out this spring. But, it’s not just union members calling for a fair return on work.You probably heard about the Amazon fulfillment center employees in Minnesota who went on strike on Amazon Prime Day, calling for better working conditions and respect on the job. Google workers worldwide staged massive protests last fall, demanding an end to workplace harassment. And, video game developers are joining together to fight for a voice at work.  As I travel, I’ve walked some of these picket lines and talked to some of these workers, really listening to the issues on their minds. I know you hear the same things back home: Paychecks are not going as far as they used to. Health care costs are eating up gains at the bargaining table. Downward pressure on retirement security. Attacks on our democracy. The growth in technology and how that will impact the future of work and the future of workers.  More and more, working people see America as a place where the rich get richer and the rest of us get by. Frankly, it’s not hard to see why. Not when 40% of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for an emergency, and more than 60% of Americans haven’t seen a raise in more than a year. And, for the 9 in 10 workers not yet in unions, that anxiety is multiplied. They simply do not have access to the kind of quality jobs that your members bargain for every day.Here’s the thing: It doesn’t have to be this way. Economic insecurity is not inevitable. It’s a policy choice. We can choose different policies. And, I think it’s time for a change. Don’t you? One of the best ways to reverse inequality is through investment. So, let’s invest! And let’s start with our infrastructure. We should be spending our tax dollars on policies that benefit the middle class, fix our roads and bridges and put the hard-working women and men of the Operating Engineers to work on job sites in every single community across the country.President Callahan knows what I’m talking about. At the 2017 AFL-CIO convention in St. Louis, he led our resolution on infrastructure. He talked about the once in a lifetime opportunity we have in front of us. To build America. To grow the labor movement. To create good, high-paying, family-sustaining jobs. This should be a no-brainer. It’s one of the few issues where business and labor agree. And, for years, we’ve heard both Democrats and Republicans all say they support infrastructure investment, too. Yet, here we are...again...still waiting. Aren’t you sick of waiting, sisters and brothers? I am!
Because the livelihoods of working people and the future of our nation’s infrastructure shouldn’t be a partisan issue. Bottom line: It’s time for the federal government to step up and lead on infrastructure, and especially, a highway bill. I hope the rumors that a draft could be coming soon are true. If so, that’d be record time! But until we see ink on paper, we’re going to keep fighting for a long-term bill that lifts working people up, grows our economy, creates good jobs and provides more opportunities for women and people of color! We cannot and will not tolerate more inaction. So, when you go up to the Hill, push your elected officials and demand that infrastructure and a highway bill be their top priority. Ask them to finally get this done for the American people. It’s time to rebuild our country with union labor and Davis-Bacon. And here’s the best part: Building our infrastructure will also help build our labor movement. More dollars available for construction creates jobs and means more opportunities for training as new people come into our movement.

Did you know the labor movement is the second largest provider of worker training in the U.S. behind only the military?

That’s our best-kept secret. But it shouldn’t be! Not when student loan debt is now more than a TRILLION dollars...leaving millions of families burdened with enormous bills, only to see their child struggle to climb the economic ladder upon graduation.We need to let more people know about apprenticeship programs, which can lead to a career filled with dignity, opportunity and advancement. Everyone is talking about workforce development and training like it’s something new. But, the Operating Engineers have been training working people for more than 100 years. And, it works!Look at the incredible, state of the art, 265-acre training facility in Crosby, Texas. President Callahan, congratulations on an enormously successful first year. Even though I haven’t seen it in person yet, I’m confident in saying that it’s a home run: More than 200 dorm rooms, 12 crane pads, welding bays, 17 modern classrooms and labs—what more could you want? I hope to make a trip there soon to see it for myself!This type of investment in training and education is an incredible way to show our value and relevance to the broader public as well. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve seen people who are anti-union change their minds when they learn everything our movement is doing to improve people’s lives. Building strong partnerships—both public and private—are also crucial to our survival, and the Operating Engineers can show the entire labor movement the way on that. For example, right now, Operating Engineers and members from across the Building Trades are working with NASA on the SLS Rocket at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11, your members are helping to prepare for future missions to Mars. How incredible is that? It’s not totally surprising though. You’ve been making history since the beginning of your union: The Golden Gate Bridge, the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty and Hoover Dam—these are all your projects. America wouldn’t look the same without the work of the Operating Engineers! And, that’s something to be enormously proud of. You are proof that by creating and sustaining good jobs and training workers for the future, we can win a stronger, more prosperous America. We have a lot of work to do, but I like our chances. Our movement is changing, getting stronger, bigger and more popular with the public. And with the Operating Engineers leading the way, we’re showing America that when we stand together, we win together. Thank you for having me today. Let’s get to work!

183,Trumka Points to Worker Resilience at ILA Convention,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-points-worker-resilience-ila-convention,7-22-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the 55th Quadrennial Convention of the International Longshoremen's Association: 

Good morning, ILA! It is great to be here. Thank you, Brother Harold (Daggett), for that very kind introduction. I appreciate your friendship and your leadership. You and the entire executive team are doing a tremendous job leading this great union forward. To every ILA member out there, thank you. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your solidarity. Thank you for making this country go. Our ports are filled with American heroes. And you deserve nothing but the very best. I got my start in the labor movement more than 50 years ago. And I’ve never been more excited than I am today. Union approval is at 62 percent, the highest in 16 years. 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in three decades. And MIT found that nearly half of non-union workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance. That’s more than 60 million people. Something is happening in America. Working people are rejecting an economy that leaves too many of us behind. I look around this room, and I remember why I’m in this fight. We turn bad jobs into good jobs. And, we turn good jobs into great jobs. We don’t do it for the money or the glory, the fame or the fortune. We do it because someone did it for us, and before that, someone did it for them. We do it because we’re called to. That’s who we are. We’re trade unionists. I was born and raised in a small community in Southwestern Pennsylvania. I’m a third-generation miner. The coal company owned everything except the church and the union hall. They had the town. But we had the people. We fought. We bled. We sacrificed. Some of us died. And along the way, we turned coal mining into a career that you could raise a family on. Never forget that the American Dream itself was built through solidarity. You’ve done the same thing with longshore work. Around the time I was playing football and thinking about where to go to college, Teddy Gleason was securing the future of ILA members for decades to come. Your guaranteed annual income program and container royalty payments were visionary acts of collective bargaining. More than half a century later, those year-end checks are still coming. Gleason’s legacy of leadership lives on today in Brother Harold and the ILA’s six-year master contract which includes wage increases, national health care and no fully automated ports from Maine to Texas. You did that! My friend and partner, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler, will talk more about the future of work tomorrow. But let me say this: The ILA is an example for the rest of the country. Raising wages. Guaranteed health care. A fair share of the wealth we help create. A real voice on the deployment of technology. This is the future we can...and must...win for all of us. Teachers and nurses, pilots and engineers, at our ports and on our factory floors, public and private, rural and urban, men and women, black and white, gay and straight, immigrant and native-born.Brothers and sisters, are you with me? In the richest country in the world...at our richest point in history...every worker should be paid enough to support their family. One job should be enough! No one should go broke just because they get sick. No one should die on the job. No one should be paid less because of their gender. No one should be fired for who they are. Everyone should have a voice. Everyone should have a fair shot and a fair shake. And everyone should be able to form a union. This is our time. This is our moment. This is our country. And we’re taking it back for the people who work! I mentioned football earlier. I had a high school coach named Bear Stuvek. He taught me about perseverance, dedication and good, old-fashioned hard work. Bear used to put us through a drill called “Bull in the Ring.” I’m certain it would be banned today.Twelve of my teammates would circle around me. Bear would count off...1, 2, 3, 4...1, 2, 3, 4. He’d call the ones. They’d come and hit me. Then the twos. Then the threes and so on. Bear would keep calling their numbers. And, I’d keep getting hit...harder and harder. Before long, I’d start hitting back. I’d hit back with everything I had. I’d hit back until they finally got the message that while you may knock me down, you will NEVER knock me out. You won’t make me quit, give up or give in.The labor movement...we are that bull in the ring. We’ve been getting hit over...and over...and over again. Every single day. From every direction.Trade. Taxes. Immigration.Wages. Health care. Retirement.Overtime. Workplace safety. The freedom to form a union.The forces of corporate greed are still trying to deny you the right to strike by moving longshoremen under the Railway Labor Act. Well, the last time I checked the ILA hasn’t gone on strike since 1977. But you better believe the right to strike has provided the leverage to put more money in your pockets.Anti-worker politicians are also looking for new excuses to waive the Jones Act. Let me tell you something: I was offended when the right-wing tried to use the tragedy in Puerto Rico to scapegoat a law protecting American jobs and American workers. A Jones Act waiver would not have saved a single life in Puerto Rico. You know what saved lives on that island? The leadership, fundraising, dedication, skills and patriotism of the International Longshoremen’s Association! Thank you for that! They keep taking shots at us. But the labor movement is growing stronger. When Bear put me in that ring, sometimes I’d be on the ground so long I’d wonder whether I should get up. Somehow I always did. Something inside me made me do that.Workers across this country are embracing this part of ourselves. We are putting aspiration above fear. We’re punching back. We’re standing strong. We’re fighting back. And we’re finally starting to go on offense. I couldn’t come here today without talking about the most important piece of legislation to be introduced in a long, long time. It’s called the PRO Act—Protecting the Right to Organize. In other words, letting us do our jobs without interference from anti-union employers or anti-worker politicians. It protects the right to strike. It rolls back right to work. It includes first contract arbitration, substantial relief for workers whose rights have been violated and real penalties for employers who break the law. If President Trump wants to build an economy that’s good for workers and not just Wall Street, he should stop giving tax cuts to corporations and the 1%, and demand that Congress send him the PRO Act today. Do your job so we can do ours!We are also going on offense to win a better, fairer, NAFTA. Listen, I know how important global trade is to your industry. We support trade. For too long, if you opposed a trade agreement for any reason, you were belittled as a protectionist. But our movement is trying to shape globalization...not stop it. We are working to change the debate by focusing on trade rules, the structures that, for too long, have killed jobs and lowered wages.Of course, we should open up new markets for our products and do business with people all over the world. We want our nation’s ports humming.The real challenge is to advance trade policy that creates shared prosperity and makes the world stronger and safer. By that standard, NAFTA has been a miserable failure. The ILA has shown great solidarity on this issue. You reject the false idea that to move our goods to market through the ports of Charleston, Savannah and Baltimore, we need to put union members on the unemployment line in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. That’s not trade. It’s greed. Unfortunately, the current new NAFTA proposal being championed by the Trump administration falls short of what we need. It lacks any real way to enforce higher labor standards. A trade agreement that can’t be enforced is completely useless. Let me put it another way: Would you ever accept a collective bargaining agreement that is unenforceable? I didn’t think so. It is time for all three countries to go back to the drawing board and come up with an agreement that actually works for workers. Bring us a deal like that, and we’ll support it.But if the president insists on a premature vote, we will have no choice but to oppose it.Workers are fed up with this race to the bottom. We’re fired up. And, we’re not gonna take it anymore!We reject those who tell us the NAFTA model is “inevitable.”We reject a world of obscene inequality and choose a world of broadly shared prosperity.We deserve better. We demand better. We’re fighting for better. And, we’re going to win better!Protecting the right to organize and winning a new direction on trade is part of our broad vision for a better America.To get there, we need to keep electing pro-worker candidates. At our 2017 AFL-CIO Convention, we passed a resolution committing the labor movement to electing more union members to public office. And in 2018, we did it. Because of our efforts recruiting, training and supporting these candidates, nearly 1,000 additional union members are at the decision making table today. And that’s led to the passage of pro-worker legislation from coast to coast and everywhere in between. Brothers and sisters, we need to carry this momentum into 2020. There are many candidates running for president. Some are new faces. Many are friends...even good friends. But, this election is so much bigger than any individual.2020 cannot be about personalities. It MUST be about workers.That means talking to us and getting to know us. It means visiting our worksites and our union halls. It means marching on our picket lines. It means learning about our hopes and dreams...and understanding our concerns. It means an agenda that is unambiguously pro-worker and pro-union. It means having a plan to make it easier to form unions and harder to bust them. It means knowing inside and out how our trade, tax, labor and immigration policies have been used to batter working families. And being ready to fix them on day one. It means not just talking about infrastructure, but actually getting the job done. It means filling the NLRB, the Labor Department, every single government agency and the courts with champions of collective bargaining.And the first test of whether or not you’ll be a pro-union president is how you treat the people who work on your campaign. So, here’s my message to every candidate for president: Show us how committed you are to unionism and allow your campaign workers to organize. Be more than just a neutral party. Be an active partner. Many of the candidates I’ve spoken with have already made this commitment, and so far, a few campaigns have secured union cards. I hope others will follow suit. The late governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, said you campaign in poetry...and you govern in prose. But for too long, our elected leaders have campaigned in promises and governed in excuses. Or worse. 2020 must be different. The stakes are too high, and working people are drawing a line in the sand this time. We’re refusing to settle for less in this election. Not when...in some parts of the country...it’s still harder to form a union than climb a mountain. Not when 40 percent of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for an emergency. Not when more than 60 percent of workers haven’t seen a raise in more than a year, but CEO profits are at record highs!Working people built this country from the ground up. We keep her running every day. Yet far too often, we’ve been disrespected, disregarded and abandoned. So, we are demanding from a president the same thing we demand of ourselves: Hard work. Integrity. Honor. Guts. Grit. And, sacrifice. It doesn’t matter if there’s a D, R or I next to your name. If you refuse to truly make the cause of workers your own, then we cannot endorse you. But...if you join us...and fight for us…and walk in our shoes...we will move heaven and earth to elect you. And together, we can put this country back where it belongs...in the hands of the workers who make it go.We’ll march for it. We’ll organize for it. We’ll fight for it.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?We’re going to fight for higher pay.We’re going to fight for better health care.We’re going to fight for a secure retirement.And, we’re going to fight for an economy where every worker...every single worker...has the freedom to form a union and bargain collectively.We’ve earned it, brothers and sisters. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We dock the ships, fight the fires and lift the loads. We care for the sick. We mine the coal. We serve our nation with dignity and pride. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night!This is our time! This is our moment!WE are the American labor movement...and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!Thank you, ILA! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
184,Shuler: Johns Hopkins Should Live Up To Its Values,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-johns-hopkins-should-live-its-values,7-20-2019,"The following are AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler's prepared remarks at a rally in support of nurses at Johns Hopkins Hospital: Sisters and brothers, Johns Hopkins Hospital was founded 130 years ago on the ideals of “respect, dignity and integrity.” Its philanthropist namesake specifically set aside funds for a hospital that would “treat the poor without charge” no matter the patient’s “age, sex or color.”Today, Johns Hopkins Hospital is abandoning its values!A recent report from NNU and the AFL-CIO found that over the past decade, Johns Hopkins has filed more than 2,400 lawsuits in Maryland courts over payments for alleged medical debt from former patients. In more than 400 of those cases, the hospital won the right to garnish patients’ wages or bank accounts.Johns Hopkins hardly needs help. It’s a multi-billion-dollar business! In 2017 alone, it received nearly $165 million in tax breaks—and here’s the kicker—$25 million in what’s known as “rate reimbursements”....to provide care to low-income patients who don’t have health insurance or cannot cover their out-of-pocket costs.Charity care is something Johns Hopkins is REQUIRED to offer by the state of Maryland. Yet, it falls short of that obligation! Many Johns Hopkins patients would likely qualify for help to pay their health care bills, but say the hospital never even told them it was an option!It’s no wonder Johns Hopkins consistently ranks last or next to last among Maryland hospitals in charity care relative to the reimbursements it receives from the state.And listen to this: Of the 10 zip codes with the highest number of residents being sued by Johns Hopkins, 9 have poverty rates higher than the state average, and 5 have child poverty rates more than double the state average.These lawsuits disproportionately harm African-Americans, the families who live side by side with the hospital. John Hopkins is a bad neighbor!Despite our report and the media attention it got...despite widespread community criticism and outrage...and despite recent announcements from two other large hospitals—Mary Washington Healthcare in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and Methodist Le Bonheur [bawn-er] in Memphis, Tennessee—Johns Hopkins is STILL continuing its egregious medical debt practices!That’s why we’re calling on Johns Hopkins to:Cancel all medical debt lawsuits filed against low-income patients!End the practice of garnishing wages!Increase the amount of charity care it provides!And guarantee that ALL patients are informed of the opportunity to qualify for free or reduced medical care!We’re demanding no less than fair treatment! We’re demanding justice in Baltimore and beyond! We’re demanding that Johns Hopkins Hospital lives up to its values! Sisters and brothers, is that too much to ask?Johns Hopkins—it’s time to end these egregious practices NOW!© 2023 AFL-CIO.

185,Trumka Rallies with Johns Hopkins Nurses ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-rallies-johns-hopkins-nurses,7-20-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a rally in support of nurses at Johns Hopkins Hospital: 

Thank you, Sister Bonnie (Castillo)! You are one of the strongest, most passionate voices in our movement. Your leadership is second to none. And AFL-CIO Secretary Liz Shuler is here! I don’t know how Liz does it. Everywhere workers are fighting for a voice...Liz finds a way to be there. She’s an invaluable partner and a great friend. Brothers and sisters, I am here today in this great city...with this great union...to deliver a simple message to Johns Hopkins Hospital...get on board or get out of the way! Nurses are the most trusted public servants in our nation. Year after year. You treat the sick. You comfort the families. You put the care in health care. And you deserve a voice on the job! A full voice. An equal voice. The type of voice that can only be achieved by coming together in a union. Johns Hopkins is trying to silence your voice. They are acting like the Walmart of medical centers. But here’s the thing...no corporation or institution is stronger than a committed group of working people willing to risk everything for each other. And when that group of people happens to be nurses, you better believe we are going to win. We know it won’t be easy. Johns Hopkins is spending millions of dollars to prevent nurses from having a voice. The National Labor Relations Board found that management has interrogated nurses and taken steps to block workers from having conversations about forming a union. It’s a reminder why Congress needs to pass the PRO Act—Protecting the Right to Organize—so employers like Johns Hopkins think twice before breaking the law. But we are not waiting for Washington to act. Nurses want a voice today. Nurses want a union today. Nurses want a better life today. We’re gonna fight for it. We’re gonna march for it. We’re gonna organize for it. It might be 100 degrees, but we’re just getting started. No matter how long. No matter how hard. Whatever it takes. Hear me loud and hear me clear: Johns Hopkins nurses are going to win a union! © 2023 AFL-CIO.

186,"Trumka at USA Gala: Protect, Preserve and Pass On Our Nation’s Outdoor Heritage",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-usa-gala-protect-preserve-and-pass-our-nations-outdoor-heritage,7-16-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Union Sportsmen's Alliance 2019 Conservation Gala: Brother Scott (Vance), thank you for the kind introduction, and most importantly, for your leadership of the Union Sportsmen’s Alliance (USA). There’s no doubt in my mind that this organization is skyrocketing to success because of your vision and advocacy. Thank you.To the USA Board of Directors, your support and guidance are second to none. Thank you. Brothers and sisters, thank you all for being here tonight and welcome to the House of Labor.I’m so proud to be the Chairman of this wonderful organization that brings together two of my favorite things: Unionism and the great outdoors. And, I’m especially honored to be the very first member of the USA. It’s true. The number on my membership card is stamped “1.”It’s hard to believe that it’s been 12 years since seven union leaders stood with me when we launched the USA to bring working people together in common purpose—uniting our communities and caring for our planet in a way that makes us stronger and better.Today, we’re growing, reaching more people and doing more for our communities and the outdoors.The USA now has more than 300,000 active members—and counting—making us the fastest-growing nonprofit conservation organization in the country. Last year alone, we held more than 50 conservation dinners and shoots, bringing together more than 8,000 union members. We formed many new partnerships with industry and conservation leaders, like the National Shooting Sports Foundation, Outtech, Worldwide Trophy Adventures and the National Wild Turkey Federation, which lift up our members and advance our mission. We also partnered with the Union Veterans Council and offered membership free of cost to all union veterans. I’m pretty proud of that one. We celebrated the grand opening of our new, union-built world headquarters in Spring Hill, Tennessee. And most importantly, we delivered on our mission to complete more conservation projects and hold more community outreach events than ever before. We were responsible for 40 Boots on the Ground projects from Maryland to Oregon—and everywhere in between—where more than 600 volunteers worked 5,000+ hours and donated a quarter of a million dollars in labor. This brings the total number of hours from this fantastic program to almost 29,000 and the total value of donated labor to almost $1 million. Remember, this was all just in the past year—when we broke every previous record to date. And, I know this year will be an even greater success.  I want to give you a few more numbers that truly show the widespread community impact that makes the USA so powerful and promising.On a single day this year, 800 kids across the country got to experience the thrill of casting out and waiting for a tug on the end of the line. 800 kids—in a single day! Since 2017, we’ve taken 10,000 kids fishing. You heard that right: 10,000. And, they get to take home their very own rod and reel combo and tackle box. Imagine the influence these experiences have on them. Imagine the love of the outdoors these special days spark. And, imagine the new conservationists and nature enthusiasts born from those priceless moments at the end of the dock. One of my favorite things to do in this world is to take my grandson, Trey, fishing. I get to show him all the same things my dad taught me all those years ago. Every family should get to experience that bond. It’s a real gift.That’s why projects like the Suncoast Youth Center in Tampa are so important. We’re finishing up some work on it right now—adding a handicapped-accessible ramp, dock and pier built with 100% union power—so it’s ready for the grand opening in November. When it opens, 6,000 kids every year will get to go fishing and learn about marine life and conservation. That’s why we do what we do, brothers and sisters. Introducing kids—and adults—to the great outdoors, experiencing its beauty and learning how to protect our planet brings people together.It’s something that transcends politics and partisanship and ideology. It belongs to all of us, and it’s passed down from generation to generation. This work strengthens our union family, improves our communities and shows the public the value of unions. It’s a win-win-win.  But it’s only possible because of everyone here tonight who shares this vision and is willing to work hard to make it a reality. There’s not another organization in the country that brings together various union trades at every level, from the international to the local, to protect, preserve and pass on our nation’s outdoor heritage. I’m so proud of what we’ve done together, and I’m excited for our future. We all should be. Teddy Roosevelt said it best when describing our country’s beautiful lands: ""We have fallen heirs to the most glorious heritage a people ever received, and each one must do his part if we wish to show that the nation is worthy of its good fortune.""Every single day, the Union Sportsmen’s Alliance proves that we are a nation and people worthy of our outdoor heritage. So, stand with me, support the USA and keep up the good work. Thank you, and God bless you for all you’ve done, and all you will do! © 2023 AFL-CIO.

187,Trumka Urges Senate Democrats to Focus on Kitchen Table Economics ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-urges-senate-democrats-focus-kitchen-table-economics,7-10-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the following remarks before the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee:Good morning. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar, for inviting me back. To you, Leader Schumer, Senator Durbin, Senator Murray and the entire caucus, I appreciate this opportunity to bring forward the voices of working people.  I’m also proud to be surrounded by my fellow leaders in the labor movement. We have a great team.On July 4th, the Washington Post ran a headline entitled: “This doesn’t look like the best economy ever.” The article went on to describe the 40 percent of Americans who say they are still struggling to pay the bills. Their prosperity isn’t based on the Dow or the GDP. They judge progress in wages and health care and the ability to provide a better life to their children. And by every measure, they are working harder for less.  I witnessed this anxiety firsthand on a recent swing through Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. I visited 6 cities over 3 days to talk about the new NAFTA. At each stop, I heard from people who are searching for answers. They believe with every fiber of their being that the deck is stacked against them. Politically. Economically. You name it. They are frustrated. And they don’t trust Washington.Yet our trade tour also demonstrated that working people are hungry for a conversation. They want it. They need it. And if you don’t go and have it with them, someone else will. And that person or group may not have workers’ best interests at heart. The 2016 election is the most obvious example of this.So more than anything, I encourage you to spend this August recess talking to working people about kitchen table economics. Tell them about the PRO Act, Senator Murray’s bill to update and strengthen our labor laws. When I was on the road, most people hadn’t yet heard about this landmark legislation. Well, they were experts on the PRO Act by the time I was done with them. And guess what? They loved it. They were excited about it. They know better than anyone how hard it is to form a union and how our labor laws are completely unfair. And it wasn’t just the Midwest. In the first half of this year, we held large gatherings of union activists in every region of the country. We asked workers what issues were most important to them. The top answer by far was fixing our outdated labor laws.So the PRO Act is not just good policy. It’s good politics. 41 senators have signed on. I urge the rest of you to become cosponsors today, because I'll be blunt: If you can’t get behind protecting our right to organize, well, then that’s pretty much the end of the conversation.I also hope you talk about trade during the break. Working people want to replace NAFTA with an agreement that works. I heard that message in town hall after town hall. But no one, especially not the victims of outsourcing, are ready to support something that is unenforceable and fails to live up to our expectations. August is an opportunity to explain to your constituents what’s wrong with the current proposal and what it would take to get your support. Constructive efforts to achieve a better deal, like the enforcement proposal put forth by Senators Brown and Wyden, will go a long way to winning over our members. Finally, I want to reiterate something I said throughout our trade tour. We can’t fix the economic rules if we don’t fix NAFTA. But we also can’t fix the rules if we only fix NAFTA. We need a full court press on a wide range of economic policies that advance good jobs, higher wages, great benefits and the freedom to form a union. So whether it’s pensions, immigration, protecting federal employees, voting rights, the future of work or raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, the labor movement is ready to help advance a pro-worker agenda. And that starts with you talking to us and making our issues your own. August is a chance to tell working people what you’re for instead of who you’re against. Visit our worksites and communities. Tell us your plan to rewrite the rules of our economy and win a stronger, brighter, fairer America. Mention the PRO Act everywhere you go! If you engage and listen to workers, we will respond. And that’s your path back to the majority. Thank you very much. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
188,Trumka Highlights Importance of Federal Reserve Activism,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-highlights-importance-federal-reserve-activism,6-25-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks to a gathering of labor leaders who have positions within the Federal Reserve or are active in the campaign to push the Fed to adopt pro-worker policies:Good morning. Thank you all for being here. I just spent the week in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan holding town halls on the future of NAFTA. At each stop, I met regular working people who are hungry to rewrite the economic rules so they work for us, not the wealthy few.Working people understand that the economic system and the political system are not working for us. I want to reiterate a point I made at each of the events last week. We can’t fix the rules if we don’t fix NAFTA. But we also can’t fix the rules if we only fix NAFTA. We need a full court press to win a wide range of economic rules that allow us to win good jobs, higher wages, great benefits and the freedom to form a union.And the Federal Reserve is a great place to start. An everyday union member is likely to ask: what does the Fed have to do with me? The answer is everything. Federal Reserve policy decisions have deep ramifications in the daily lives of working families.The thing we hear about most is interest rates. There are news stories almost daily about whether the Fed will cut rates, now, or in the future. For the record, given miniscule wage growth, I believe it is time for a rate cut.The Fed also regulates the banking and financial sectors and defines full employment. While these issue areas seem wonky, they have a direct impact on our nation’s ability to provide workers a rising standard of living.That’s why we are using our voice to demand that the Federal Reserve fulfill its mandate to maintain full employment. Full employment is critical for shared prosperity because it creates an environment where working people can bargain for a proportional slice of increased productivity.  In other words, full employment boosts real wages. If wages are flat, as they have been for decades, then full employment has not been achieved, no matter how low the unemployment rate gets. African-Americans, Latinos and women in particular share in wage gains when we are at or near full employment. But, that is not happening.Too often, the Fed has been a prisoner to overblown concerns about inflation and prioritized price stability over a raising wages economy. This has stolen productivity gains from a generation of working people. Now—the central tenet of the American Dream—that our children can inherit a better life than ours—is in serious jeopardy. And that is a threat to our entire democracy. We were pleased to see a shift toward full employment during Janet Yellen’s and now Chairman (Jerome) Powell’s tenures. But each monthly jobs report with low unemployment and stagnant wages is a reminder that we are not there yet. This is a message a group of national labor leaders and I brought directly to Chairman Powell in April.Powell was clear. He said he wanted to see wages go up. He agreed that income inequality was a serious problem. And he committed to an ongoing conversation with the labor movement at all levels. That’s where you come in.Some of you have board seats on one of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks located across the country. And some of you hold other positions. All of you are active in our campaign to influence the Fed’s policy making. I want to thank you for raising the voice of working people within the Federal Reserve. Although some of you do this work alone, I want to assure you that the entire AFL-CIO has your back.That’s why we’re gathered here today: to come together, learn from each other and strategize about the best ways to maximize our collective impact. How do we engage the Fed consistently and effectively? What issues should we be raising? What are you hearing in your region? Let’s have a discussion. If you hold an official position within the Fed, please let me know what it is. Who wants to go first? © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
189,Trumka Honors the Service of Peg Seminario,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-honors-service-peg-seminario,6-25-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at AFL-CIO Safety and Health Director Peg Seminario's retirement celebration: Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. Thank you for being here.It is an honor to join you today to celebrate one of the greatest trade unionists in the history of the AFL-CIO—Peg Seminario. And I mean that with every bone in my body. 42 years. 42 years of service and solidarity, passion and professionalism.Believe it or not, Peg has served under every single AFL-CIO president. We all know Peg is fond of asking provocative questions at meetings, so I wanted to reverse the roles a bit and ask her this:Peg, who was your favorite AFL-CIO president?Now she knows how it feels!Peg’s candor is one of her greatest qualities. She is always pushing us to do better...to BE better. She is never afraid to ask a tough question. And she doesn’t hesitate to speak truth to power.In fairness, she probably took being bold a little too far when...on her first day at the AFL-CIO in 1977...she parked her bike in George Meany’s spot. Meany was none too happy!Thankfully, Peg made it to her second day... and her third...and so on. And now, nearly 15,000 days later, we’re celebrating the incredible legacy she’s crafted.Peg got her start under the tremendous George Taylor. And through his guidance, she took the work of safety and health to another level. No one has done it longer or better than Peg. Nobody has worked harder or smarter. Millions of people are better off because of Peg’s leadership and dedication. She’s saved countless lives, many of whom will never know it.The Occupational Safety and Health Act was adopted in 1970. Peg came on board at the AFL-CIO seven years later. And every day since, she has used her voice and influence to build the architecture of that law, signed by a Republican president, I might add. How times have changed. But Peg never has.Every major safety and health rule adopted in the past 40 years bears Peg’s mark. Beryllium. Asbestos. Lead. Noise. You name it.Many of you probably saw Jon Stewart’s moving Congressional testimony about the need to provide 9-11 first responders with lifetime medical care. Well, you should also know that the 9-11 Health and Compensation Act would have never become law in the first place if it were not for Peg’s relentless determination.And what about silica? Workers have been warning about the dangers of this chemical compound since Eleanor Roosevelt was first lady. Yet it wasn’t until 2016, after 19 years of regulatory stops and starts, that the United States government finally updated its antiquated silica standard. And it only happened after Peg called out the Obama Administration for issuing fewer safety and health standards than the Bush Administration. Her voice moved mountains.As you know, I have more than a passing interest in safety and health issues, given the dangers of being a mine worker. I lost multiple relatives to Black Lung and I pledged to never let that happen to another family  So I have come to rely on Peg’s expert counsel.I could go on and on about the ways Peg helped workers. But she also had a tremendous impact on the people she worked with.Peg’s colleagues and friends use words like “teacher” and “mentor” to describe her. They each can provide examples where she went out of her way to welcome and support them. They are quick to mention her poise, stamina and humor. They say she is the consummate collaborator. Peg brings people together.Peg has been a particular inspiration to the working women of the AFL-CIO. Did you know that Lynn Rhinehart started as a safety and health specialist under Peg? Together, this dynamic duo started the AFL-CIO’s “Death on the Job” report in 1992, launching it at a press conference with then-Secretary-Treasurer Tom Donahue, who is here with us today. There is no doubt that the report they started 27 years ago, coinciding each April with Workers Memorial Day—has helped shape the debate around the state of safety and health. Today, the Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps and reports more detailed figures about worker injuries and deaths than ever before—because of Peg’s push for transparency. Lynn is only one of many who benefited from Peg’s guidance. When Peg needed to hire a deputy, she made an investment in a young woman named Rebecca Reindel. Maybe she saw some of herself in Rebecca. An upstart with the right mix of passion and values. Perhaps Peg remembered the opportunity she was given early in her career when she got interested in the labor movement after raising concerns about worker lead exposures at Boston City Hospital. Rebecca has grown into the job with skill and grace, and while Peg can never be replaced, she leaves the AFL-CIO’s safety and health work in trusted and reliable hands. Paving the way for others—including the creation of fellowships and opportunities to teach and inspire the next generation of safety and health activists—is one of the defining aspects of Peg’s legacy.Peg’s name has been floated many times to head up OSHA. But here’s the truth: she already has. In many ways, occupational safety and health was born and raised under the careful stewardship of Peg Seminario. Work is safer because of Peg. Lives are better because of Peg. Progress has been made, slowly but surely, because Peg demanded better. Peg helped change the world, from right here at 815 16th Street, and each of us had the privilege of watching her doing it.Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “To know one life has breathed easier because you have lived, that is to have succeeded.” By that, and every other measure, Peg, you’ve more than succeeded. You’ve soared. Congratulations on a well-deserved retirement.We love you. We’ll miss you. And, it will never be the same without you. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
190,Trumka Rallies for Improvements to New NAFTA Proposal ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-rallies-improvements-new-nafta-proposal,6-25-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a press conference on Capitol Hill to deliver petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of Americans demanding that there is no vote on a new NAFTA until it is improved:

Good afternoon.Thank you, Rosa (DeLauro), for that introduction and for being such a champion on this issue.I am here on behalf of the 55 unions and 12.5 million members of the AFL-CIO to say: NO VOTE on the new NAFTA!I spent last week holding roundtables and town hall meetings at ground zero for our failed trade policies. Pittsburgh, Youngstown, Akron, Dayton, Cleveland and Detroit.The workers in these towns sent me back here with a message: the new NAFTA is not good enough!People are hurting. They are searching for answers. And they refuse to support another trade agreement that doesn’t account for their needs.We are delivering hundreds of thousands of petitions to Congressional offices today. Faith leaders, labor unions, environmental organizations, consumer groups—we are all united. NO VOTE on a new NAFTA until it is worthy of the American people. As I traveled through the Midwest last week, I couldn’t help but think about 1994.We warned Congress. We warned President Clinton. We KNEW this would happen. 25 years later, we simply will not allow history to repeat itself. Do we want to replace NAFTA? Of course we do. But doing it right is more important than doing it fast. So there should be NO VOTE until Mexico can prove that it has the infrastructure and resources to eliminate nearly a million protection contracts and raise wages and standards through REAL unions. There should be NO VOTE until the new NAFTA has a dispute settlement process that can’t be blocked by one of the parties. There should be NO VOTE until workers have a way to enforce this agreement, including the right to stop goods at the border that were produced in violation of the labor chapter. Working people are watching. We are ready to turn the page on NAFTA. We are ready to end the era of outsourcing. So it is time for negotiators to go back to the table and hammer out an agreement that is good for working people. Bring us a deal like that, and we’ll support it.

But until then: NO VOTE! NO VOTE! NO VOTE!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
191,Shuler Launches 2019 AFL-CIO Executive Paywatch ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-launches-2019-afl-cio-executive-paywatch,6-25-2019,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks on a press call announcing the 2019 Executive Paywatch report. We're excited to launch this year’s AFL-CIO Executive Paywatch. For more than two decades, the AFL-CIO has been tracking—and calling out—CEO pay at America’s largest companies. This year is no different.  In 2018, CEOs of S&P 500 companies made, on average, $14.5 million. That’s a $500,000 dollar raise from 2017. Compare that to the average rank-and-file worker who received barely more than a $1,000 raise, bringing total take-home pay in 2018 to $39,888. You might think, “It’s better than nothing.” But here’s the key point: Even with that extra cash, wages are not keeping up with inflation. The average worker isn’t making enough to cover rent for a two-bedroom apartment in 15 of the largest cities across the country! Meanwhile, 40% of hourly workers have nothing saved up for an emergency, while 75% have less than $500.

We know this equality gap isn’t new. Over the past decade, the average S&P 500 CEO’s pay increased by more than 5 million, while the average worker only saw an increase of less than $800 a year. Not surprisingly, the CEO-to-worker pay ratio remains high: 287 to 1.  I’ll repeat that: 287 to 1. Meaning the average CEO earns 287 times what an average employee earns. This disparity represents a fundamental problem with our economy: Productivity and corporate profits are through the roof, but wages for working people are flat—and staying flat.What’s causing this? And, how can we fix it? Well, the recent tax cut only made things worse by widening the gap between the 1%and the rest of us. The corporate income tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21%, and 60 of the largest U.S. companies paid nothing in federal income taxes last year—despite being profitable. In other words, Amazon users pay more for a Prime membership than Amazon paid in federal income taxes last year. Stock buybacks are another loophole CEOs are taking advantage of to line their own pockets. Instead of investing in their greatest asset—workers—companies can now purchase their own stock to boost short-term stock prices and executive pay.Here’s an example: In recent years, video game maker Activision Blizzard kept significant profits overseas to avoid paying federal taxes on those profits here in the U.S. In 2018, Activision recorded a $225 million federal tax benefit, despite $1.8 billion in earnings worldwide. It also reduced its offshore cash holdings from $3 billion to $1.4 billion. And in January 2019, it adopted a stock buyback program to repurchase up to $1.5 billion in shares. This was just a month before the company announced it was laying off 800 employees—nearly 8% of its staff. I should also mention that Activision Blizzard staff are trying to unionize and bargain for better wages and working conditions. Here’s the kicker: Activision CEO Robert Kotick received $30.8 million in 2018—319 times the typical employee.This is like legal highway robbery. And here’s how corporations get away with it. First, buybacks can help CEOs and executives artificially meet their incentive pay targets. For example, stock buybacks can boost earnings per share—even if earnings don’t grow.Second, the short-term boost in a stock’s price from a buyback is often used by executives to liquidate shares that they received as part of their compensation package. The AFL-CIO is calling on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to take action on corporate executives who abuse stock buybacks for their own personal gain. And, we’re supporting federal legislation that would ban stock buybacks. Bottom line: For too long, corporate greed and rigged economic rules have created a relentlessly growing pay gap between CEOs and the rest of us. It’s why everything from a college education to retirement security to gas prices are getting harder and harder for people to afford. We see it every day in communities across the country. And that must change. Our economy works best when consumers have money to spend. That means raising wages for workers and reining in out of control executive pay. This year’s report is a stark reminder that working people must use our collective voice to form bigger, stronger unions and rewrite the economic rules once and for all.

192,Trumka Remembers Larry Hanley ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-remembers-larry-hanley,6-24-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a memorial service for longtime Amalgamated Transit Union leader Larry Hanley:Good morning.On behalf of the 55 unions and 12.5 million members of the AFL-CIO, I want to offer my deepest condolences to Larry’s wife and children, along with the entire ATU family. He loved this center. He loved all of you. Larry is gone too soon for sure, but his presence and vision for a more just nation remains with us...as a source of energy and inspiration. And his impact as a trade unionist and labor leader will be felt for generations to come.I got my start in a movement called Miners for Democracy. Our goal was to make the United Mine Workers of America more democratic. We took on corruption. We challenged the status quo. And we put the UMWA back where it belongs—in the hands of its members. Larry fought that same good fight at the ATU, starting as a young man with his local union on Staten Island and eventually rising to the highest ranks of our movement. Larry understood that trade unionists have one fidelity and one fidelity only—to support, strengthen, empower and serve working people.Larry was a bus driver. And the metaphor is almost perfect. Whether he was behind the wheel of an MTA bus or at the reins of the 200,000 member ATU, Larry was always taking people with him, carrying out his responsibilities with purpose and vigor, and never forgetting why he became a union activist in the first place.He was a relentless advocate for a public transportation system that works for workers. He was an unapologetic champion for social and economic justice. He pushed the labor movement to organize more boldly and strategically. And, he was one of the toughest fighters you’d ever meet.Larry never went along to get along. He not only challenged all of us to do better, he made all of us better. And that’s how we will carry on his legacy and honor his memory. God bless Larry Hanley. Rest in power, my brother. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
193,Trumka at ETUC Congress: Move Forward as One Global Labor Movement,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-etuc-congress-move-forward-one-global-labor-movement,5-23-2019,"President De Leeuw and General Secretary Visentini, thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on behalf of the 12.5 million members of the AFL-CIO.We all know the profound danger of rising inequality, and the threat it poses to economies, societies and democracies around the world. Right now, international economic rules are balanced in favor of the world’s largest corporations. At the same time, global worker power is shrinking.No country is immune. Nobel-prize winning economist Sir Angus Deaton led a recent review of inequality in the UK and found that Britain’s increasing inequality is on the same upward trajectory as the United States, where 62% of Americans haven’t seen a raise in more than a year.When discussing the study, Deaton said: “There’s a real question about whether democratic capitalism is working, when it’s only working for part of the population.”Brothers and sisters, we have reached a breaking point.Some have argued that there are two ways to reach a solution: Either disengage from multilateral institutions or accept the current failed framework.Neither is true.Rather, the AFL-CIO, together with our European brothers and sisters, and partners around the world, must take the lead in reshaping multilateral institutions to promote broadly shared prosperity and inclusive, sustainable economies. In return, these institutions must respond, not just to the commercial interests of global firms, but to the aspirations and desires of working people in developed and developing economies alike. We need multilateral policies and institutions that build worker bargaining power, lift wages and promote and defend democracy across the globe. We cannot improve wages and working conditions in the United States and Europe, but leave behind developing countries.These rules must also be written with the recognition that trade and globalization have pushed wages down and weakened worker negotiating power. We can...and must...do better with more inclusive, responsive and dynamic trade rules that create jobs, higher wages and sustainable and responsible economic growth that protects our environment and respects human rights and dignity around the world. A rules-based trading system should also require robust enforcement that swiftly addresses violations.Achieving successful global trade rules also depends on strong domestic policies that support working people by expanding the right to collectively bargain and providing enhanced skills training. We cannot expand the global framework if any of our existing structures at home are weak. So, we must continue to push our leaders across the board to strengthen, enact and enforce these policies.The labor movement is in favor of multilateralism...but not just any multilateralism. This is not a binary choice between corporate dominated globalism and authoritarian nationalism. If there is going to be a global order, it must be a more democratic and more economically just and sustainable one.Brothers and sisters, this is an enormous challenge. None of us can underestimate it because inequality, by nature, feeds on itself. Once a society reaches a certain level of inequality, the winners can rig the rules for the next round of the game. And desperate working people can be wedged apart and divided by empty promises and dehumanizing rhetoric.We must move forward as one global labor movement...together in our fight for shared prosperity. We must address the challenges of our time head on from climate change to technology to social mobility.That’s why the AFL-CIO is deeply committed to continuing our work together to strengthen the global labor movement and the rights of working people around the world. The need is as great as it’s ever been, but so is our resolve. And, we look forward to joining our global allies to continue building a strong, effective movement that can fight for improved working conditions and greater social justice.Thank you.

194,Trumka in Michigan: 2020 Must Be About Workers,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-michigan-2020-must-be-about-workers,5-15-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the following remarks to the Michigan AFL-CIO Convention:Thank you, Brother Ron (Bieber), for that kind introduction. You want to talk about an iconic labor leader? You’ve got one of the best here. For three generations, the Bieber family has given everything they’ve got to unionism. We’re all better off for it, and I’m proud to call you my brother and my friend.You’ve also got two of the strongest and brightest leaders in the country in Detroit Metro CLC President Daryl Newman and IBEW Local 58 Business Manager Brian Richard. Thank you, both, for your leadership and vision.Brothers and sisters, I’ve been thinking a lot about your theme: “Icons of Labor.” You’ve got a great list. It’s hard to pick just one.There’s A. Philip Randolph, the first African American Vice President of the AFL-CIO, who introduced trade unionism to millions of African Americans. And, along with his deputy Bayard Rustin, he became a trusted confidant of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and helped organize the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.Then, there’s Walter Reuther, one of the founders of the AFL-CIO, and president of the United Auto Workers. Detroit knows a thing or two about him. But, did you know that Reuther stood next to Dr. King for his “I Have a Dream” speech? He was a fierce advocate for civil rights, and his ideas for national health insurance, economic equality and job security were ahead of his time.And then, there’s John L. Lewis. As a third generation mineworker, I’ve always held a deep-seated respect for him. He rose up the ranks during some of the darkest times in our nation’s history, and at every turn, he never lost focus of who he was fighting for—his fellow mineworkers.Lewis also formed the organizing committees that built many of America’s greatest unions, and pushed our institutions to build a genuine movement of working people.Brothers and sisters, we are who we are...we lead the lives we lead...and we live in a far better country...because of these leaders. The best way to honor them is to continue to build the movement and nation they could only dream of.I recently got my 50-year pin from the UMWA. There have been a lot of ups and downs in the last half century. But, I’ve never experienced anything quite like the uprising happening across America right now. Working people aren’t sitting quietly...as the wealthy continue to rig the rules of the economy that we built with our hands. We’re standing up and speaking out to demand what we’ve rightfully earned!After decades of stagnant pay and education cuts, teachers in red AND blue states are walking out...and winning. 30,000 grocery store workers and UFCW members across New England went on strike to save their health care and retirement. Guess what? They did it! UNITE HERE members in Detroit and other major cities marched on picket lines to secure a fair deal from  Marriott, the biggest hotel chain in the world. Each of their biggest demands were met, setting a new industry standard in the process.Something is happening in America. Workers are putting aspiration above fear.The corporate power structure in this nation had us on the ropes. They thought the fight would be called...or workers would throw in the towel.They thought we would continue to work longer and harder for less. They thought they could take our health care and pensions and peace of mind, no questions asked. They thought they could treat us like numbers on a balance sheet...costs to cut, rather than the human capital that powers our nation and the world.  They thought we’d sit back while the politicians they bought passed trade deals and tax laws that made us poorer and weaker.They thought we’d give up...give in...and tap out.Brothers and sisters, they underestimated us.We’re off the ropes, and we’re fighting back.I don’t know about you, but I have a fire in my belly. I feel it here in Michigan. Working people are writing a comeback story, and each of you are the heroes.Steelworkers. Autoworkers. Mineworkers. Teachers. Public sector. Private sector. Urban. Rural. Black. White. Immigrant. Native born.Dearborn to Detroit. Flint to Ann Arbor. Lansing to Washington D.C.We’re kicking ass. We’re taking names. And, we’re going to take this country back for working people!One way we can recapture America is by rebuilding it.It’s Infrastructure Week….Again.Another year has passed without the federal infrastructure bill our country so desperately needs.Another year of inaction.Another year of talk…followed by more talk.I won’t sugarcoat it: That ride from the airport was bumpy. And I grew up in a town with dirt roads, so I know about potholes.Robust and sustainable investment in America’s infrastructure is one of the core functions of a successful civilization, and I use “civilization” for a reason:We need healthy and safe water systems...not just in Flint and other Michigan communities, but all across America...that meet the standards of a civilized nation.We need functioning transportation systems...bridges, highways, railways and ports...that meet the standards of a civilized nation.We need a safe and effective energy and utility infrastructure...including natural gas and oil pipelines...that don’t leak or break down and put harmful chemicals in our air or water. And we need to make sure that investments in new technology create good jobs and shared prosperity.Brothers and sisters, this isn’t a bonus. This is the basics!Your governor, Gretchen Whitmer, gets it. She’s put forward a transformative, inclusive infrastructure package that will make Michigan a national leader again. And the labor movement is going to help her pass that bill into law!But, it’s not just Michigan. The average American spends nearly four full days sitting in traffic. Four days, brothers and sisters. I can think of a million things I’d rather do than sit in traffic. And, poor infrastructure costs the average worker more than $3,000 every year.Americans are losing time and money, and our nation is losing its competitive edge. All because Washington refuses to work together and deliver a strong, national infrastructure package for the American people.Brothers and sisters, are we gonna let them hold us back any longer?Hell no!The White House and Congress recently agreed on the need for a $2 trillion infrastructure package.That’s a good start.But we’ve heard these promises before. It is time for ACTION!The federal investment we need to fix America’s infrastructure will create millions of good-paying, family-sustaining, UNION jobs across the country.That’s why the labor movement is ready to help turn proposals into shovel-ready projects with the most highly-skilled and well-trained workforce in the world. That’s why national infrastructure funding must uphold high labor standards, good wages and other protections.Our icons didn’t believe in a broken America falling behind other civilized, innovative nations. They believed in a strong America...connected from sea to shining sea...supporting American jobs...American resources...and American steel!So our message to Washington is this: Build today. Build tomorrow. Build America. Build union. Enough talk. Build! Build! Build!Building our infrastructure is incredibly important. But it will not be enough if we don’t rebuild the way we do trade in this country.You know that better than anyone here in Michigan. Our trade deals have been nothing more than corporate handouts. And no deal has done more damage to working people than NAFTA.It’s hard to believe, but 2019 marks 25 years since NAFTA went into force. For working people, NAFTA has been nothing short of catastrophic. It put big business in charge of economic strategy. And look what happened: Millions of American jobs were lost to Mexico and other low-wage countries.GM is now the top carmaker in Mexico. And two-and-a-half decades into NAFTA, plants are still closing here in the Midwest.So when President Trump opened the door to replacing NAFTA, I jumped at the opportunity. I wanted a seat at the table. I carried your hopes and dreams into every single meeting. You may have heard that a deal is now on the table. Let me be perfectly clear: It is not good enough.For one, it does nothing to address outsourcing. It’s a repeat of the old NAFTA and fails to stop the hemorrhaging of good-paying American jobs to Mexico.The new NAFTA also has no effective way to enforce its rules. It literally allows a party accused of violations to stop a settlement panel. It’d be like giving an accused thief the right to shut down their own trial.This is crazy. If a trade deal can’t be enforced, then it’s nothing more than a set of suggestions.The current proposal also includes a new round of giveaways to multinational corporations, like making it easier for Big Pharma to lock in high drug prices.This is not the deal President Trump promised. And it is not a deal we can support.Bring us an agreement that creates jobs and raises wages here in Michigan…bring us an agreement that actually works for working people...and we’ll help pass it.But, let me be absolutely clear: If the administration insists on a vote before these issues are fixed, we will bury this deal right next to the TPP.Working people are united. So how can we move the ball forward on infrastructure and trade and every other important issue?One major answer is politics.Walter Reuther famously said, “There’s a direct relationship between the ballot box and the bread box, and what the union fights for and wins at the bargaining table can be taken away in the legislative halls.”Rick Snyder spent 8 years chipping away at our rights here in Michigan. There were some really tough moments in this state. But you got up off the ground and fought back. And you helped make 2018 the year of the worker.You elected 80 union brothers and sisters to public office, including Governor Whitmer.And, I know Brother Ron is continuing this good work now and is working to recruit even more unionists to run for office at every level of government.But brothers and sisters, you didn’t stop there.Oh no. You kept the progress going by re-electing a champion, Senator Debbie Stabenow.You passed ballot measures to improve voting rights.And you sent a clear message to the entire nation—the path to power in 2020 is through the labor movement.There are many candidates running for president. Some we know well. Others are new faces. Many are friends. But this election is so much bigger than any one individual.2020 cannot be about personalities.It MUST be about workers.That means talking to us and getting to know us.It means visiting our worksites and our union halls. It means marching on our picket lines. It means learning about our hopes and dreams and understanding our concerns.It means an agenda that is unambiguously pro-worker and pro-union. Democrats need to stop trying to split the difference between Main Street and Wall Street.It means having a plan to make it easier to form unions and harder to bust them. It means knowing inside and out how our trade, tax, labor and immigration policies have been used to batter working families. And being ready to fix them on day one.It means championing a Workers’ Bill of Rights and rallying support for the PRO Act, the most sweeping labor law reform bill in a generation. It means committing to filling the NLRB, the Labor Department and every government agency with champions of collective bargaining.The first test of whether or not you’ll be a pro-union president is how you treat the people who work on your campaign.To put it simply, you can’t be pro-union if you’re an anti-worker boss. So, here’s my message to every candidate for president: Show us how committed you are to unionism and allow your campaign workers to organize. Be more than just a neutral party. Be an active partner.Many of the candidates I’ve spoken with have already made this commitment, and so far, two candidates’ campaign workers have secured union cards. I hope others will follow suit.Another icon, the late governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, said you campaign in poetry and you govern in prose. But for too long, our elected leaders have campaigned in promises and governed in excuses. Or worse. No more. The stakes are too high, and working people are drawing a line in the sand this time. 2020 must be different.We’re refusing to settle for less in this election. Not when...in some parts of the country...it’s still harder to form a union than climb a mountain. Not when a record 7 million Americans are more than three months behind on their car payments. Not when 62 percent of Americans haven’t seen a raise in more than a year.Working people built this country from the ground up. We keep her running every day. Yet far too often, we’ve been disrespected, disregarded and abandoned. So, we are demanding from a president the same thing we demand of ourselves: Hard work. Integrity. Honor. Guts. Grit. And, sacrifice. It doesn’t matter if there’s a D, R or I next to your name. If you refuse to truly make the cause of workers your own, then we cannot endorse you.But...if you join us...and fight for us…and walk in our shoes...we will move heaven and earth to elect you. And together, we can put this country back where it belongs...in the hands of the workers who make it go.With the names of the leaders who came before us etched in our minds, hearts and souls, we’ll march for it. We’ll organize for it. We’ll picket for it. We’ll fight for it.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?We’re going to fight for higher pay.We’re going to fight for better health care.We’re going to fight for a secure retirement.We’re going to fight for a real investment in our infrastructure to finally fix the damn roads!We’re going to fight for an economy where every worker...every single worker...has the freedom to form a union and bargain collectively.We’ve earned it, brothers and sisters. We keep America great. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We build the roads, fight the fires and lift the loads. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day. We tuck her into bed at night.This is our time! This is our moment!We are the American labor movement and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!Thank you, Michigan! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
195,Trumka Kicks Off NALC Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-kicks-nalc-stamp-out-hunger-food-drive,5-9-2019,"Thank you, Brother Fred (Rolando), for your leadership and your friendship.God bless the National Association of Letter Carriers. There is no finer group of public servants in this country. You do it all.I am very proud to once again offer the AFL-CIO’s support for the Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive.This community service campaign is unparalleled. 27 years and still going strong!You’ve collected food for the hungry in every corner of our country. 1 billion pounds and climbing!One thing I’ve learned during my 50 years in the labor movement is that every successful campaign is made possible by hard-working staff.This drive takes planning and organization and attention to detail. And that’s why the Letter Carriers are so lucky to have Christina Vela Davidson leading the way.She’s set an ambitious goal of 80 millions pounds this year. Brothers and sisters, are we going to do it?Hell yeah we are!To help, the AFL-CIO is donating half a million bags.Here’s what we are facing: 1 in 8 Americans struggle to get enough to eat. This includes more than 12 million children. In the richest country in the world. At our richest point in history.This is shameful. We must do everything in our power to reverse it. And we can start by making sure every worker has the right to form a union and bargain collectively.But as long as there is hunger in this nation, we will use the massive infrastructure of the labor movement to bring help AND hope to those who are suffering.So put some non-perishable food items out by your mailbox this Saturday.If you see a letter carrier, thank them. And while you’re at it, tell your members of Congress to protect the Post Office from privatization.The Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive is one of the most important things we will do this year.It reminds me of a story the late statesman and humanitarian, George McGovern, would tell. As Director of the World Food Program in the 1960s, he had the opportunity to meet with Pope John XXIII. The Pope grasped his hand and said, ""Mr. McGovern, when you go to meet your Maker, and he asks, 'Did you feed the hungry?' You can say, 'I did.'""Brothers and sisters, with Saturday’s effort, we too, can say, “I did.”The NALC.The labor movement.All the sponsors and food banks.We are going to feed the hungry.Thank you very much.  © 2023 AFL-CIO.

196,Trumka Calls for Passage of the PRO Act,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-calls-passage-pro-act,5-8-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the following statement before the House Education and Labor Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions in support of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act: Chairwoman (Frederica) Wilson...Ranking Member (Tim) Walberg...and members of the subcommittee:On behalf of the 12.5 million members and 55 unions of the AFL-CIO, thank you for inviting me to testify today.I want to thank House Education and Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott and his colleagues for the foresight they have demonstrated in crafting this important legislation.Gallup recently put the popularity of unions at 62 percent—a 15-year high.The Wall Street Journal reported that 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in three decades. Teachers from West Virginia to Arizona. Google employees. Workers in every sector and every region are embracing the transformational power that comes from joining together in common cause.MIT found that half of non-union workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance. That’s more than 60 million Americans.So why haven’t we seen a rise in union membership commensurate with this surge in approval, recognition and desire? The answer is clear: Our woefully outdated labor laws no longer serve as an effective means for working people to have our voices heard.The stated purpose of the National Labor Relations Act is to encourage collective bargaining. Yet in the more than 80 years since its passage, every amendment to the law has made it harder for workers to form unions.Today, union-busting consultants are paid tens of millions of dollars to deny workers a voice on the job. And once a union election is won, these same bad actors do everything in their power to undermine the collective bargaining process.Workers are forced to sit in meetings where the only item on the agenda is bashing the union. Pro-union workers are fired. Employers refuse to bargain in good faith. Some refuse to bargain at all. And far too often, the financial consequences for breaking federal law are virtually nonexistent.This must change. The Protecting the Right to Organize Act will change it.Imagine if, when running for office, your opponent could force the electorate to listen to speeches urging them to vote against you. Imagine your opponent had the power to punish these voters if they supported you. Imagine that Congress refused to recognize your rightful election. And then imagine that once you were finally seated, you were denied the basic rights and responsibilities that come with the office.This is the grim reality for a huge number of workers seeking to form a union today. Misinformation. Reprisal. Delays. And even after all of those obstacles are overcome, an outright refusal to recognize the election results. I’ve included several such examples in my written testimony.That’s why half of non-union workers want to join a union today, yet less than 12% actually have one.Why does this matter? Simply put, workers in unions bargain for higher wages and are much more likely to have health care and a pension. The union advantage is even greater for people of color and those without a college degree. Unionized workers have a real say in critical workplace issues like time off to care for a loved one, the deployment of technology and protection from discrimination.A happier, healthier, more upwardly mobile workforce is good for our economy as consumers have additional money to spend. Local tax revenues increase, and education funding is bolstered. Inequality shrinks. It’s a virtuous cycle.The union movement and all working people are hungry for pro-worker reforms to our existing labor laws. The PRO Act would do many important things, chief among them provide more substantial relief for workers whose rights have been violated...ensure a process for reaching a first contract once a union is recognized...and create a true deterrent, so employers think twice before violating the law.Something is happening in America. Workers are embracing collective action with a fervor I haven’t seen in a generation. It is time for our laws to catch up. It is time to make the PRO Act the law of the land.Thank you.

197,Shuler: Infrastructure Should Be a Priority,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-infrastructure-should-be-priority,4-9-2019,"Sisters and brothers, good morning!Sean McGarvey, thank you for your leadership. It has been incredible to watch you bring such clear direction and laser focus to the building trades agenda.And, to my fellow Secretary-Treasurer, Brent Booker, thank you for your camaraderie and friendship in the trenches...as well as to ALL the Building Trades General Board of Presidents, for your vision and dedication to our movement. We are in good hands.I’m thrilled to be here today, and I bring greetings from the 12.5 million working people of the AFL-CIO, who are standing with me in spirit on this stage, fighting the fights and celebrating the victories alongside you.And, there’s no better example of the fight than the recent battle with Related Companies at Hudson Yards and the Count Me In campaign. It was a show of resolve and activism we haven’t seen in a long time. And, we can’t thank the New York City Building Trades and Gary LaBarbara enough for their phenomenal leadership.I also want to say hello to our Canadian sisters and brothers and celebrate the new Director of Canada’s Building Trades Unions, Arlene Dunn. I’m always excited to see union sisters in top leadership positions, and I’m looking forward to working with you in your new role.Sisters and brothers, I’m a proud IBEW member. Any IBEW leaders out there today?Travelers in our union sometimes joke that IBEW stands for “I’ve Been Every Where.” And, these past few years, it’s really felt that way; from Portland to Poughkeepsie to Puerto Rico and everywhere in between.As I travel the country, I’m excited to see that construction employment is still growing and creating good, middle-class union jobs—jobs that allow you to provide for your family and live with dignity.But, I also meet far too many hard-working women and men struggling to keep up. They’re worried about paying the bills. They’re worried about how technology will impact their jobs in the future, and whether they’ll still have good pay and benefits with the low road, low wage standards they see creeping in all around them.More and more, they see America as a place where the rich get richer and the rest of us get by.And for the 9 in 10 workers not yet in unions, that fear is even more urgent.They simply do not have access to the kind of quality jobs that your members bargain for every day.Here’s the thing: It doesn’t have to be this way.Economic insecurity is not inevitable. It’s a policy choice. We can choose different policies.And, I think it’s time for a change. Don’t you?One of the greatest antidotes to inequality is investment.So, let’s invest. And let’s start with our infrastructure.We should be spending our tax dollars on policies that benefit the middle class, fix our roads and bridges, and put the hard-working women and men of the Building Trades to work on job sites in every community across the country!If we keep current pace and sit on our hands, it will take 80 years to repair all of the structurally deficient bridges in the United States.80 years. And, that’s JUST bridges!Can you imagine Japan or Germany moving that slowly?Anyone staying in Virginia this week?Well, one of the bridges to cross from Virginia to D.C. is called the Memorial Bridge. It’s the one right behind the Lincoln Memorial.Did you know that bridge has been deemed “structurally deficient”?Just think of the volume of people crossing that bridge coming in and out of the city each day.Thankfully, the Memorial Bridge is being completely redone by the skilled-craft professionals of the Baltimore-DC Building Trades, but that isn’t always the case.Ask the families of those who lost loved ones in Minneapolis. And just a few weeks ago, another overpass collapsed in Tennessee. Fortunately, no one was seriously injured, but the point is that it never should have happened in the first place.Our safety isn’t the only issue at hand. Our future competitiveness is on the line, too.

If we can’t fix a bridge in one of the richest regions in the country until it’s practically crumbling down—a bridge that everyone from members of Congress to CEOs to the President of the United States travels across—how can we connect America to the world?That’s why business and labor are united in support of a strong infrastructure investment package.Congress supports infrastructure. President Trump calls himself the “builder president.” So get in a room and get the job done!Aren’t you sick of waiting, sisters and brothers? I am!Because this shouldn’t be a partisan issue.We know that our states and cities are doing the best they can to fix issues when they pop up. They’re moving money around in budgets and creating bond measures to fund new schools and construction projects. They’re dealing with bad roads with whatever money they can scrounge up and straining to keep public transit systems functioning.They’re making this a priority even when it’s really difficult.But, these fixes are like slapping a band-aid over a gushing wound. It’s going to keep re-opening without a permanent solution.Bottom line: It’s time for the federal government to step up and lead.So, when you go up to the Hill this week, this is the time to push your elected officials and demand that infrastructure be their top priority. Ask them to finally get this done for the American people.It’s time to turn campaign promises into more union construction jobs.Building our infrastructure will also help build our labor movement. More dollars available for construction and creating jobs means more training and new people coming into our trades.Did you know the labor movement is the second largest provider of worker training in the U.S. behind the military?That’s our best-kept secret. But it shouldn’t be! Not when millions of families are burdened with the costs of college and going into debt, only to see their child struggle to climb the economic ladder upon graduation.We need to let more people know that there is an earn while you learn model. It’s called an apprenticeship program. And afterward, there’s a good job waiting for you, and more importantly, a career filled with dignity and opportunity and advancement.Everyone is talking about workforce development and training like it’s something new. But, the Building Trades have been training working people for more than 100 years. And it works!Look at the new Pipefitters state-of-the-art training center outside Boston. It just opened last week, so, this is truly a brand new facility — ready to offer fantastic careers to workers in the region.Investment in training and education is an incredible way to show our value and relevance to the broader public as well. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve seen people who are anti-union change their minds when they see what we can do and how it impacts people’s lives.Especially women in the trades.I've seen the cutting-edge strategies some of our unions are instituting to recruit and retain more women. And, the work Eric Dean and the Ironworkers’ leadership, and my friend Vicki O’Leary, did to usher in the first paid maternity leave policy in North America last year was nothing short of inspiring.I’m so excited that the UA is leading on this as well, and I strongly encourage all of our unions to take this on. Because the bottom line is that we need more women in the trades and these are the policies that will show women that our unions are for them.Sisters and brothers, creating a diverse, highly-skilled workforce is not just good for us. It builds value for and trust with our partner employers.I recently spoke at a memorial service for my friend and mentor, former IBEW International President Ed Hill. And, I know Sean was honored to speak there as well.Ed was the visionary behind the IBEW’s Code of Excellence, which most of you know, was an initiative to demonstrate the skills, value and professionalism of union members to employers, customers and communities. And, it’s known building trades-wide as “Value on Display Everyday.” It has changed the entire script and gotten us on jobs that were untouchable in the past.Building strong partnerships—both public and private—are crucial, and the Building Trades can show the entire labor movement the way on that.Look no further than our sisters and brothers in San Diego, who just won a $3 billion Project Labor Agreement (PLA) with the Airport Authority.Pretty impressive, right?These types of partnerships are proof that—at a time when our country is deeply divided—we can still come together to create and sustain good jobs, train workers for the future and win a stronger, more prosperous America.An America of equality and opportunity and hope. An America of unions. An America that builds.That’s the goal we’re all working toward. We have a lot of work to do, but I like our chances. Our movement is changing, getting stronger, bigger and more popular with the public. And with the Building Trades leading the way, we’re showing America that when we stand together, we win together.Thank you for having me today. Now, get up there on Capitol Hill and show those elected officials the way, and let’s get to work! © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
198,"Trumka: Machinists Will Strengthen Amtrak, Organize Delta ",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-machinists-will-strengthen-amtrak-organize-delta,4-9-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the follow remarks at the 2019 IAM Transportation Conference: 

Good morning, brothers and sisters! Viva Las Vegas! How are you feeling today? Did you win any money last night? Thank you, Brother Sito (Pantoja), for that very kind introduction. Transportation union members could not have a better advocate. And let’s give it up for my friend and your international president Bob Martinez. At our last convention, the AFL-CIO formed a commission to tackle the future of work and unions. As the manufacturing sector chair, Bob is one of the key voices at the table. He has been thoughtful, visionary and every single union member is better off for his service. It is also an honor to follow my good friend Bob Scardeletti. Bob, thanks for everything you do.Brothers and sisters, today I want to tell you a story about two flagship American transportation companies, the corporate villain they have in common...and the labor movement that is going to win fairness and justice at both.Let me start with Amtrak. How many Amtrak workers do we have in the house? I love Amtrak. It’s an experience like no other. From the Acela lounge to the platform to the train car to the station, each moment is a meaningful encounter with the friendliest, best-trained transportation professionals in the world.And this is despite the fact that Amtrak has been a political punching bag for decades, constantly facing threats of underfunding and privatization. You see, Amtrak has two things the corporate right-wing hates: government funding and unions.It is one thing for Amtrak to come under assault from the elected leaders entrusted with its oversight. It is entirely another for the company to be undermined from within. And that brings me to today’s villain: Richard Anderson. Good ole, Richie boy.The guy who walked away with $72 million in stock when he left Delta—after years of trying to stop the workers who make it run from having a voice on the job. The guy who hasn’t found a workplace right he supports or a corporate loophole he opposes. Richard Anderson isn’t the guy you hire to save a company. He’s brought in to strip it for parts. To cut every corner, squeeze every dollar and screw every worker. When J&L Steel was liquidating my father’s pension, they called it “ridding our company of warts.” Richard Anderson follows in their footsteps. He shouldn’t be running a hot dog stand, let alone Amtrak.In less than two years on the job, Anderson is already wreaking havoc. Station agents have been laid off. A major call center has been closed. Dining car service has been eliminated on some long distance routes. To Richard Anderson, this is just the cost of doing business. To the rural station agent, the Riverside call center worker and the Capitol Limited dining car employee, it’s dignity...it’s security...it’s money in the bank and food on the table. And Amtrak workers are not the only ones suffering. Customers also bear the brunt of these mindless cutbacks.Sometimes in a small community, like the ones near my hometown in Southwestern Pennsylvania, you have a personal relationship with the station agent. They tell you about their kids and their hopes and their dreams. And you tell them about yours. That’s part of what makes Amtrak special. Sometimes when you need to make a change to your travel plans in a pinch, as I often do, it’s good to talk to a human being. Sometimes Julie (Amtrak’s automated agent) just isn’t good enough. Sometimes when you take a long-distance train trip, paying a hefty fair and sacrificing the speed of air travel, you want to head into the dining car for a freshly prepared meal instead of having to choose between a pack of peanuts or pretzels.These are the things Richard Anderson simply doesn’t understand or care about. He has as much loyalty to Amtrak as any corporate vulture does to the company they inherit. No, he’s not going to save this great American icon.But we are.The Machinist-led fight for fairness and justice at Amtrak...a major part of rising collective action in this country...has personally inspired me and I want you to know that the 12.5 million members and 55 unions of the AFL-CIO stand with you. Richard Anderson may have the deep pockets, but we have the men and women who make Amtrak go...who make America go. So I have a message for Amtrak today: If Richard Anderson is unwilling to use his position to support, strengthen and grow this company...then fire his ass and find someone who will!Now it’s time to talk about the second transportation company in our story. Because the truth is Richard Anderson honed his skills as a corporate raider and union buster while CEO of Delta. Delta’s motto is “Keep Climbing.” That is, of course, unless you happen to work there. Climbing the corporate ladder has too often been met with outright hostility from Delta management. In fact, part of Anderson’s legacy is keeping the vast majority of Delta non-union.How bad has it been? Many of you in this room can probably tell the war stories. You have the scars to prove it. So let me just offer a brief reminder of what we’re up against.Delta has used the same twisted approach in every single union election. Workers are harassed by managers. As soon as organizing posters are put up in employee lounges—permitted by law—Delta tears them down.At the same time, managers distribute posters encouraging workers to rip up information about the election and voting instructions before even bothering to read about their rights.In 2015, Delta encouraged voting on company computers, littered with anti-union propaganda, where employees sign on with special passwords, making it possible to monitor their activity. Some workers voted with a manager looking over their shoulder. There were union-busting billboards and animated videos.Talk about a sham.  And even after all that, you came up only 300 votes short, in a unit of more than 15,000.The Machinists are back at it as we speak, and I couldn’t be more proud of you. The deck might be stacked against us, but the voices of working people will prevail.40,000 ramp workers and flight attendants are ready to join our movement. For job security. For economic mobility. For fair treatment and predictable schedules. For the right to bargain collectively and retire with dignity.Make no mistake, the AFL-CIO and the entire labor movement supports your efforts. Your fight is our fight.Brothers and sisters, hear me loud and hear me clear: the Machinists are going to win a union at Delta Airlines!Now some of you might be wondering why I’m so confident. And that brings me to the last character in our story: us. I’ve talked about Richard Anderson and the two companies he infected. But the reason I think we can save good union jobs at Amtrak and win good union jobs at Delta is because something is happening in America.Fed up with an economic and political system that doesn’t work for them, workers are turning to each other—to us. Every single day, more and more working people are realizing that the single best way they can improve their lives...is to join a union.Gallup recently put our popularity at 62 percent—a 15-year high. The Wall Street Journal reported that 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in three decades. There were strikes and organizing wins in every sector and every region. There is momentum for good jobs and fair trade and long overdue investment in our infrastructure. We elected more than 960 union members to public office last year. And just last week, union members flipped a state senate district in Pennsylvania and captured two of the three biggest city halls in Wisconsin.So when someone tells me we can’t win at Amtrak or Delta or anywhere else, I simply refuse to believe them. I think about my old high school football coach...a guy named Bear Stuvek. He taught me about perseverance, dedication and good, old-fashioned hard work. Bear used to put us through a drill called “Bull in the Ring.” I’m certain it would be banned today.Twelve of my teammates would circle around me. Bear would count off...1, 2, 3, 4...1, 2, 3, 4. He’d call the ones. They’d come and hit me. Then the twos. Then the threes and so on.Bear would keep calling their numbers. And, I’d keep getting hit...harder and harder. Sometimes I’d be on the ground and wonder whether I should get up. Somehow I always did. Something inside me made me do that.Before long, when Bear would put me in that ring, I’d start hitting back. I’d hit back with everything I had. I’d hit back until they finally got the message that while you may knock me down, you will NEVER knock me out. You won’t make me quit, give up or give in.The labor movement...we are that bull in the ring. We’ve been getting hit over...and over...and over again. Every single day. From every goddamn direction.Wages. Health care. Retirement. Overtime. Workplace safety. They’ve come after ALL OF IT. Now even the National Mediation Board wants to make it easier to decertify a union. Well, guess what? We’re still standing.Our enemies want a fight? Delta wants a fight? Richard Anderson wants a fight? I say, bring it on!We’re the true American patriots. We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united. We’re rising in solidarity…REAL solidarity…where your picket line is my picket line, and my picket line is your picket line.We’re going to win for Delta workers. We’re going to win for Amtrak workers. We’re going to win for every single worker in this beautiful country we are so blessed to call home.We’ll fight for it. We’ll stand for it. We’ll win it, brothers and sisters, because we’re the ones who wake America up every single day, and put her to bed at night. We ready the planes and fly the skies. We board the trains and ride the rails. We build the roads and we bear the loads. We’ll stand strong. We’ll never run and hide.We’re the American labor movement, and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!Thank you, Machinists! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
199,Trumka: New NAFTA Not Good Enough ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-new-nafta-not-good-enough,4-2-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the following remarks at the United Steelworkers Canadian National Policy Conference: 

Thank you, Brother Ken (Neumann) for your kind words. Thank you for your leadership across Canada.Brother Leo (Gerard), you epitomize a strong leader. The labor movement is fortunate to count you as one of our greatest fighters, and personally, I’m honored to call you a brother and friend.I also want to give a quick shoutout to Brother Clément [CLAY-mont] (Masse) and the more than 1,000 members of Steelworkers Local 9700 who have been locked out at A-B-I for the past 14 months. The entire labor movement has your back, and we’re hoping you can return to work soon.Brothers and sisters, I’m honored to be with you in Canada today to talk about trade policy, and what it means for workers in the U.S., Canada and around the world.For the better part of a generation, our global trading system has been rigged to enrich corporations at our expense. And no deal has done more damage to working people than NAFTA. The beneficiaries of the current trade model want to pit us against each other in their never ending quest to leave us poor, divided and weak.But we know better. We know our enemy is not American, Canadian or Mexican workers. Workers are never the enemy.Trade itself is also not the enemy. We support trade. For too long, if you opposed a trade agreement for any reason, you were belittled as a protectionist...a dinosaur...as not understanding the complex reality of a global economy. Even some of our friends told us we were fighting yesterday’s war.But our movement is trying to shape globalization, not stop it. We are working to change the debate by focusing on trade rules, the structures that, for too long, have killed jobs and lowered wages.This isn’t a matter of whether or not to trade. Of course, we should open up new markets for our products and do business with people all over the world.The real challenge is to advance trade policy that creates shared prosperity and makes the world stronger and safer. Bring us a deal like that, and we’ll support it.That deal has not yet come.Many of us here today, we’ve been at this awhile. Leo, Ken and I were sounding the alarm about NAFTA from the very start. My hair was darker then.It’s hard to believe, but 2019 marks 25 years since that agreement went into force. Back in 1994, we predicted it would be devastating for working families. I wish we were wrong, brothers and sisters. But we were right. Our continent and our world would be better off today if our leaders had simply listened to us.That’s because NAFTA worked exactly as it was designed to...as a windfall for corporations. For North American workers, it has been nothing short of catastrophic. NAFTA put big business in charge of economic strategy with the goal of moving production to places where labor is cheap and workers are exploited. And look what happened: Millions of American and Canadian jobs were lost to Mexico and other low-wage countries. Entire communities were decimated...and many are still struggling to recover today. Some will never recover.And, look at Mexico. Workers at tire plants report making $1.87 per hour. That’s one American dollar, brothers and sisters. Not pesos. These workers don’t even make enough to buy the cars they’re producing. No wonder more than 40% of Mexicans live in poverty.NAFTA made systemic worker suppression North America’s prevailing economic model. And, it has become the template for other anti-worker trade agreements...perpetuating this vicious cycle of multinationals outsourcing jobs to low-wage, low-standard regions, destroying our livelihoods in the process. Want to know why we have a global inequality crisis? Take a look at our trade deals.A quarter century later, NAFTA is still keeping wages low, and it’s still subverting the rule of law…the law that guarantees all workers the freedom to bargain collectively with our employers.  We remember when Caterpillar workers in Ontario tried to exercise that right. The company shut the factory down. Walmart workers in Quebec voted union yes. And what did the retail giant do? They cut and run.When Volkswagen workers in Tennessee tried to organize, they were threatened and told a new V-W assembly line would go to Mexico if they formed a union.And, of course, there was the tragedy when Los Mineros members went on strike and violence erupted, killing three workers. I know the United Steelworkers have been neck-deep in this struggle for fairness and justice in Mexico alongside Los Mineros, and God bless you for it!Every single one of these examples should have been a gross violation under any fair, functional and fully-enforced North American free trade agreement. Instead, not only is this type of lawlessness allowed...it is encouraged...it is incentivized...it is rewarded.No more! After a quarter-century of this race to the bottom, workers in all three NAFTA countries are fed up. We’re fired up. And, we’re not gonna take it anymore!Brothers and sisters, we reject those who tell us the NAFTA model is “inevitable.” We reject a world of obscene inequality and choose a world of broadly shared prosperity.We were right in 1994, and we’re still right today.So I have a message for every worker across this great continent: We deserve better. We demand better. We’re fighting for better. And we’re going to win better!The labor movement is committed to ensuring trade deals benefit working people…and that means three basic principles:First, trade deals should raise the standard of living and improve the lives of working people.Second, trade deals should benefit each country’s interests without burdening other trading partners.Finally, trade deals should prioritize people, not corporations.In its current form, the new NAFTA does not meet these straightforward standards.For one, there is nothing in the proposal to address outsourcing. It’s a repeat of the old NAFTA and fails to stop the hemorrhaging of U.S and Canadian jobs to Mexico. It doesn’t prevent corporations like General Motors from closing down plants and hurting workers and communities up and down the supply chain from Ohio to Ontario and beyond.The first step to address outsourcing is for Mexico to eradicate protection contracts for good. It must thoroughly reform its labor laws NOW…not promise to do so later...and, it must effectively enforce those laws and dedicate the necessary resources to ensure compliance. The Mexican people are hungry for this type of change. Now it’s time for their newly elected leaders to make it happen.The new NAFTA also has no effective way to enforce its rules. It literally allows a party accused of violations to stop a settlement panel. It’d be like giving an accused thief the right to shut down his own trial.  This is crazy. If a trade deal can’t be enforced, then it’s not a deal at all.Finally, the new NAFTA will keep prescription drug prices sky high by handing Big Pharma a guaranteed, international monopoly period over and above its patent rights.This provision will hurt workers in all three countries, and it will have a particularly harmful impact here in Canada as you seek to add a prescription drug benefit to your national health care system. Under the proposed new NAFTA, Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau will have to change Canada’s drug monopoly period from 8 years to 10 years. That’s a massive giveaway to Big Pharma.So let me be absolutely clear: If the Trump administration insists on a premature vote on the new NAFTA before these issues are fixed, we will have no choice but to oppose it. Isn’t that right, Leo?Workers across North America deserve a NAFTA that works for all of us. And, that means workers must stick together as we demand a rewrite of this bad deal!We’ve got each other’s backs, and you proved that in earlier NAFTA negotiations. You made sure your government did everything it could to get the U.S. to roll back so-called right to work. Thank you for that! Getting rid of right to work would benefit workers in both of our countries. And while the agreement before us leaves right to work in place, we aren’t sitting back. Just last summer, workers in Missouri repealed right to work with more than 67 percent of the vote. And we’re just getting started.American workers have had your backs, too, especially when it comes to tariffs. We support steel and aluminum tariffs on China and other trade cheats. Not on Canada! That’s just wrong! And I’ve let President Trump know this time and time again. We must be tough when it comes to trade. But we also must be fair and smart. Mr. President, remove the Section 232 tariffs on Canada at once!Brothers and sisters, make no mistake, the coming days are a major test for the Trump administration. They must either step up for working people and produce labor rules and trade pacts that work...or prepare to face the full fighting force of the North American labor movement...with the United Steelworkers leading the way!Close is not good enough. Not when millions of jobs are at stake. Not when lives and livelihoods hang in the balance. Not after 25 years of devastation and destruction.Bring us a deal that works, and we’ll fight for it. Bring us a deal that works, and we’ll march for it. But until that deal is secured, get back to the negotiating table and finish the job!Look, President Trump gets some credit for putting NAFTA back on the table. George W. Bush didn’t do that. Barack Obama didn’t do that. And let’s be candid: Hillary Clinton wouldn’t have done that. Donald Trump recognized early on...whether through political expediency or actual conviction...that our trade regime needed to be massively overhauled. And we’ve been meeting with his administration nonstop to let them know exactly where we stand.Unfortunately, the deal before us today tries to serve two masters...the corporate interests who have driven trade policy for decades...and the workers, largely in industrial manufacturing, who have been clobbered by those policies. But here’s the thing: You can’t serve both. Corporations have proven completely unwilling to sacrifice a single dollar for the common good. They won’t give an inch…embracing a business model that is built on the destruction of unions and good-paying jobs.So, until the new NAFTA is unequivocally better than the current draft, we must keep fighting to fix it.This process hasn’t been easy. Some of my friends have questioned my decision to engage with President Trump at all. After all, this is a president that has made our lives infinitely harder. He denied paychecks to 40 percent of the American federal workforce when he locked workers out of the United States government for 35 days. He jammed through a corporate tax cut on the backs of working people that encourages further outsourcing and automation. He took overtime pay away from more than two million people. He’s made our jobs more dangerous, slashing safety regulations and gutting the rule requiring employers to submit detailed reports on workplace injuries. And he’s been far too quick to give cover to racism, misogyny and xenophobia.Yet I believe I owe it to every single worker...in my country and yours...to find a way forward on NAFTA. If we get this deal right, we can start to change the global rules of trade, and with it...the course of history.Brothers and sisters, I’ve been in this movement for 50 years. And I have never been more optimistic. Working people are coming together in droves. Momentum is on our side. Politicians are coming to us, moved by a groundswell of support for good jobs, fair trade and raising pay.Unions on both sides of the border...we’re proving to the world that we are here to STAY. We’re on the move in every city, state and province. Black and white. Young and old. Urban and rural. Gay, straight and trans.Throughout our history, we have fought for every victory. We bled to secure the right to stand together and bargain collectively. We marched and sacrificed to end child labor. We faced down the rich and powerful to win a minimum wage. In the face of seemingly insurmountable opposition, we steadily built a fairer economy and a more just society...because we had one advantage on our side: Solidarity.The pundits claim NAFTA is too steep of a hill. They say the corporate traders will always prevail. Well, let’s prove them wrong. Let’s take to the streets...in every corner of our continent…and demand the deal we deserve.Our enemies want a fight? I say, bring it on!We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united. We’re rising in solidarity. And we’re going to win.Because we make America work. We make Canada work. We make Mexico work.We roll the steel. We make the tires. We build the roads and stoke the fires. We’ll stand strong. We’ll never run and hide.WE ARE THE NORTH AMERICAN LABOR MOVEMENT AND WE WILL NOT...WE WILL NOT... BE DENIED!Thank you, Canada! Thank you, United Steelworkers! God bless you!

200,Trumka: Organizing is the Lifeblood of Unionism ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-organizing-lifeblood-unionism,3-28-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delvered the following remarks at the 2019 Oregon AFL-CIO Organizing Summit:Thank you, Brother Tom (Chamberlain), for the kind introduction, and thank you for inviting me today. Brothers and sisters, you have a great leader here in Oregon. Tom and I just spent some time together in New Orleans at the State Fed/CLC Advisory Council Meeting. He was eager to share the incredible work you’ve been doing in this state.When the AFL-CIO passed a national resolution focused on strengthening the labor movement at the state and local level, Oregon jumped into action. You adopted a series of recommendations designed to give our unions more power and more leverage. Small CLCs were turned into chapters. Three regional positions were created to expand your impact beyond Portland. CLCs were required to submit budgets and work plans and undergo quarterly reviews. And you did it all in just 8 weeks. Brothers and sisters, you’re a model for the entire nation.Change is hard. But your willingness to embrace it is paying real dividends. You’ve had wins in organizing and bargaining and politics. You have a labor candidate school that is launching union members into the halls of power. You’re the muscle behind ballot initiatives giving workers more power and prosperity. Your Transportation Fairness Campaign is giving drivers at Uber and Lyft a voice in our economy.And guess what else? You didn’t just survive Janus. You’re growing and thriving!I had a high school football coach named Bear Stuvek. He taught me about perseverance, dedication and good, old-fashioned hard work. Bear used to put us through a drill called “Bull in the Ring.” I’m certain it would be banned today.Twelve of my teammates would circle around me. Bear would count off...1, 2, 3, 4...1, 2, 3, 4. He’d call the ones. They’d come and hit me. Then the twos. Then the threes and so on. Bear would keep calling their numbers. And, I’d keep getting hit...harder and harder. Sometimes I’d be on the ground and wonder whether I should get up. Somehow I always did. Something inside me made me do that.

Before long, when Bear would put me in that ring, I’d start hitting back. I’d hit back with everything I had. I’d hit back until they finally got the message that while you may knock me down, you will NEVER knock me out. You won’t make me quit, give up or give in.The labor movement...we are that bull in the ring. We’ve been getting hit over...and over...and over again. Every single day. From every goddamn direction.Wages. Health care. Retirement. Overtime. Workplace safety. They’ve come after ALL OF IT. Measure 101 right here in Oregon is a perfect example. And Janus was supposed to be the knockout blow. The pundits had our eulogy ready and funeral arrangements were being made.But something happened along the way. We punched back. We stood strong. We fought back.  Mark Janus had five justices in his corner...but we’re a movement of MILLIONS. And we’re not going anywhere.Brothers and sisters, the labor movement is HERE TO STAY. We’re on the move. We’re in the streets in every city and every state. From Oklahoma to Oregon. Young and old. Black and white. Immigrant and native-born. Gay and straight. Rural and urban. Republican, Democrat and Independent.Our enemies want a fight? I say, bring it on! We’re the true American patriots. We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united. We’re rising in solidarity…REAL solidarity…where your picket line is my picket line, and my picket line is your picket line.This is our country...and it’s time...high time...we took it back!I was proud to be at this summit four years ago. The focus then was rightly on Janus and its predecessor case Freidrichs. We had to prepare ourselves for the inevitable onslaught by the anti-worker Supreme Court. Internal organizing ruled the day, and our public sector unions did an incredible job selling unions to the public and converting fee payers into full members.Let me be clear: Whether you call it internal organizing or member engagement...demonstrating our concrete value, member by member, must be a full-time practice for every single union. And with Janus behind us, we can now turn our focus to the labor movement’s core mission: organizing new workers into unions.Janus might have sucked the air out of the room for awhile. But now that we’ve put on our own mask, we are ready to assist others. And that starts with going after the 60 million workers who say they would vote to join a union today if given the chance.Organizing is the lifeblood of unionism. It’s never easy. You face hurdles…stubborn obstacles and ruthless opponents. Sometimes the hurdles are even within our own institutions, and I understand how frustrating that can be for organizers...because your visions of progress are not always apparent to everyone.And yet here you are, bright and early on a Saturday morning. If you didn’t want it bad enough, you’d still be back in bed.I’ve been a member of the United Mine Workers of America for 50 years. I’ve experienced a lot of ups and downs in that half century. And I can tell you...without hesitation...that I have never been more optimistic about the future of the labor movement.Something is happening in America, brothers and sisters. Fed up with an economic and political system that doesn’t work for them, workers are turning to each other—to us. Every single day, more and more working people are realizing that the single best way they can improve their lives...is to join a union.Gallup recently put our popularity at 62 percent—a 15-year high. The Wall Street Journal reported that 2018 was the biggest year for collective action in three decades. There were strikes and organizing wins in every sector and every region. We elected more than 960 union members to public office. Workers are in motion.So how do we turn this passion into progress? How do we convert massive collective action into life-changing collective bargaining?We’ve got their attention. Now it’s time to make some moves. Unfortunately, labor law is designed for us to lose. The last changes were in 1947 and written to make it harder to organize. Current law does far too little to prevent employers from bullying and harassing workers when we try to form a union, and there is no binding process for reaching a first contract when a majority of workers make the decision to bargain collectively. The right of workers to make our voices heard through strikes, pickets and other activities continues to be fundamentally undermined by employers, politicians and the courts. Simply put, the system is broken, and the time for comprehensive labor law reform is right now. We are working on that in D.C. as we speak.But in the meantime, we’ve got to get out there on the playing field. Here in Oregon, AFSCME is organizing the courts. AFT is making inroads at Oregon Health and Science University...work that was contracted out in the 1980s. Nurses are organizing in the central part of the state. And, cannabis stores in Salem are turning UFCW gold. We can’t let up. We need more campaigns. We need more elections. We need to be bold and take risks.That’s why the labor movement is looking at new sectors to organize—from technology to clean energy. This is the kind of ingenuity and innovation we need to bring new people into our fold. We’re also looking at different industries and demographics, like what my sister, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer... and fellow Oregonian...Liz Shuler is doing to lift up the voices of workers in the video game industry.We are also looking to improve HOW we organize. About a year and a half ago, the AFL-CIO got together with 26 of our affiliates, and together, we developed a new mobile site called Action Builder...strictly for organizing. We’ve taken the old ways of organizing...the wall charts and scraps of paper...and put them in an easy-to-use mobile site. All the information for your campaigns can now be at your fingertips...24/7...just like the rest of our lives. It’s already being used by a couple unions and a least half a dozen more are preparing to launch it soon.As we look forward, I also can’t help but think back. I’m a student of the Civil War. It’s my hobby. I’m amazed that in every story, in every battle, they talk about the generals. But they never mention the foot soldiers: The common man and common woman who joined together to do uncommon things.Let me tell you: That’s how I feel today. YOU are those men and women. YOU have the power to change the world. Because as unionists, as organizers and as activists...everything we do comes back to one simple mission: lifting up the lives of working people. The best and most enduring way to do this is with collective bargaining and a contract on the job, and that’s why this summit is so critical.When you talk to your family and friends....when you talk to your coworkers...when you make the decision to fully participate in your union and get others to do the same...or better yet, join a union...that’s how progress is won!Brothers and sisters, are you ready to organize?Are you ready to mobilize?Are you ready to win safe jobs and good pay and health care?Are you ready to build a better life for our kids?Are you ready to fight for the American Dream?Brothers and sisters, hear me loud and hear me clear: WE ARE THE AMERICAN LABOR MOVEMENT AND WE WILL NOT BE DENIED!God, I love this job. I run on your energy and passion. It gets me out of bed every morning. And I’ll tell you what...we’re going to need it in this next presidential election. That’s right. I want to say a few words about 2020. Because smart politics makes for good organizing.I have a crazy idea: It’s time for America to have a pro-union president.That means candidates talking to us and getting to know us. It means visiting our worksites and our union halls. It means marching on our picket lines. It means learning about our hopes and dreams and understanding our concerns.It means an agenda that is unambiguously pro-worker. You cannot split the difference between Main Street and Wall Street. It means having a plan to make it easier to form unions and harder to bust them. It means knowing inside and out how our trade, tax, labor and immigration policies have been used to batter working families...and being ready to fix them on day one. It means championing a Workers’ Bill of Rights. And, it means committing to filling the NLRB, the Labor Department and an entire presidential administration with champions of collective bargaining.The late governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, used to say that you campaign in poetry and you govern in prose. But for too long, our elected leaders have campaigned in promises and governed in excuses.Or worse.No more. The stakes are too high, and working people are drawing a line in the sand this time. 2020 must be different.So, more than anything, the first test of whether or not you’ll be a pro-union president is how you treat the people who work on your campaign. To put it simply, you can’t be pro-union if you’re an anti-worker boss. So, here’s my message to every candidate for president: Show us how committed you are to unionism and allow your campaign workers to organize. Be more than just a neutral party. Be an active partner.Many of the candidates I’ve spoken with have already made this commitment. And earlier this month, one candidate’s campaign workers became the first to secure union cards. I hope they are the first of many.You see, we’re refusing to settle for less in this election. Not when...in some parts of the country...it’s still harder to form a union than climb a mountain. Not when a record 7 million Americans are more than three months behind on their car payments. Not when 62 percent of Americans haven’t seen a raise in more than a year. Not when Amazon doubled its profits, yet paid zero in federal taxes.Working people built this country from the ground up. We keep her running every day. Yet far too often, we’ve been disrespected, disregarded and abandoned. So we are demanding from a president the same thing we demand of ourselves: Hard work. Integrity. Honor. Guts. Grit. And, sacrifice. It doesn’t matter if there’s a D, R or I next to your name. If you refuse to truly make the cause of workers your own, then we cannot endorse you.But...if you join us...and fight for us…and walk in our shoes...we will move heaven and earth to elect you. And together, we can put this country back where it belongs...in the hands of the workers who make it go.We’ll march for it. We’ll organize for it. We’ll picket for it. We’ll fight for it.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?We’re going to fight for higher pay.We’re going to fight for better health care.We’re going to fight for a secure retirement.We’re going to fight for a real investment in our infrastructure…and that includes a Portland Major League Baseball stadium made...and maintained...by union power.We’re going to fight for an economy where every worker...every single worker...has the freedom to form a union and bargain collectively.We’ve earned it, brothers and sisters.We keep America great. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We build the roads, fight the fires and lift the loads. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day. We tuck her into bed at night.This is our time! This is our moment! Get on board or get out of the way!Thank you, Oregon! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
201,"Trumka: We are Living in ""The Fierce Urgency of Now""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-we-are-living-fierce-urgency-now,1-18-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the following remarks at the 2019 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Civil and Human Rights Conference:​Good afternoon brothers and sisters, and let me officially welcome you to the 2019 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Civil and Human Rights Conference.Thank you for being here today. Thank you for your work, your solidarity and your activism.Look at this room! You are the future of the labor movement. Our movement. And, there’s no question that each and every one of you is needed now more than ever before.  We are living in what Dr. King called “the fierce urgency of now.” One year before he was killed, Dr. King issued a warning that “In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late. This is no time for apathy or complacency. This is a time for vigorous and positive action.”Brothers and sisters, this is that time. This is a time to take risks. This is a time to get uncomfortable. That’s when real progress is made. Don’t get me wrong: The attacks against us are vicious. Workers’ rights. Civil rights. Voting rights. Women’s rights. They are all being threatened as we speak. The labor movement will always mobilize and organize to defend ourselves, our communities and our values. But we cannot afford to confuse protecting what we have with winning what we need. Dr. King’s example calls upon us to stop looking at our shoes and start reaching for the stars.Because let’s be honest: What’s working for us right now?Not our political system, when 800,000 federal workers—disproportionately black and brown—and even more subcontractors are locked out of their jobs as the government shutdown continues into its 28th day.Not our economy, when one in seven Americans hasn’t seen a raise in more than a year and five in seven Americans live paycheck to paycheck.Not the American Dream, when women, particularly women of color, still aren’t paid what they’re worth.The systems and institutions we’re supposed to rely on are broken. Not because they’re old. Because they’ve been rigged. Our economy and our politics don’t work for working people because corporations and politicians have conspired to make it that way. They want us poor. They want us weak. They want us divided. So, we have to fight back.For years, we’ve been told that we can’t. But I remember the simple rallying cry of a community organizer from Chicago, someone who actually honored the Oval Office. Barack Obama was right then, and we must heed his words today: Yes, we can!  Yes, we can! Yes, we can!The protectors of the status quo told people of color they can’t integrate, but they did.They told women they can’t vote, but they did.They warned workers not to form a union or else, but we did it anyway.They’ve been telling immigrants and asylum seekers to stay away, but no wall is big enough to stop the human desire to be free.Something is happening in America, brothers and sisters. Something we haven’t seen since Dr. King stood in President Lincoln’s shadow and told us that he had a dream.Collective action is on the rise across America: #MeToo. Students for safe schools. Black Lives Matter. Teachers striking in red and blue states. Federal workers and subcontractors taking to the streets demanding that Congress and the president do their jobs.And, all of you, standing in solidarity with tens of thousands of Americans: Women, men, people of color, workers and students, straight, gay and trans...a MOVEMENT of people taking over our nation’s capital and demanding that our voices be heard!But, brothers and sisters, we can’t let this momentum die. When I first got into the union movement, my dad put a pencil down in front of me within arm’s reach. He said: “There are two kinds of leaders. One who accepts where the pencil is...and one who claws and fights to move the pencil even further. Don’t be the first guy. Be the second leader. Push your limits. Take a risk. Move outside your comfort zone, so you can create real and lasting change.”Brothers and sisters, the status quo is easy. Do nothing and you get nothing. You stay the same. It’s the fight that’s hard. That’s what working people are after right now. Because we’re the ones hurt most by the status quo.Brothers and sisters, this is a time—THE time—to capture “the fierce urgency of now.”This is our moment to fight for an America where workers are paid fairly and treated with dignity and respect.Our moment to fight for an America that builds bridges, not walls, an America that welcomes immigrants and refugees and all those yearning to be free.Our moment to fight for an America that invests more in education than incarceration.Our moment to guarantee the right to vote. The right to form a union. The right to love who you love and not be fired for it. The right for a woman to be paid the same as a man for doing the same job. The right to be safe in our communities and not be arrested or harassed or shot because of the way we look.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight for the America Dr. King dreamed of and died for?Right here. Right now!That’s exactly what we're going to do! We'll march for it. We'll sing for it. We'll shout for it and stand for it. And the harder it is, the louder we'll sing, and the longer we'll stand!It’s only January 18th, and we have a mountain of work ahead of us. But, I take comfort in Dr. King’s famous words: “The world is all messed up. The nation is sick. Trouble is in the land; confusion all around...But only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.”Brothers and sisters, it’s pitch black outside, and those stars are twinkling!So, let’s stand together and scale that mountain.Let’s stand with workers on the picket lines—like the 30,000 teachers in Los Angeles striking right now for higher pay, a voice on the job and a better learning environment for their students!Let’s help register voters so that we can put the kind of pugnacious voter suppression we saw in Georgia and Brother (Andrew) Gillum’s Florida in the ash heap of history!Brothers and sisters, I don’t accept an America that treats people who look like me better than people who look like you. Do you? I don't accept an America where too many black and brown people are struggling to get by. Do you? I don’t accept an America where trans people are dying in the streets and children are being locked in cages. Do you? I don’t accept an America where it’s harder to form a union than bust one. Do you?My promise to you, today and every day, is that we are in this fight to win it. And, I mean really win it! We won’t be in the middle of the pack. We’ll be the tip of the spear.So, stand up if you’re ready to march. Stand up if you’re ready to fight. Stand up if you’re ready to win.We make America great. We keep it safe. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We build the roads, fight the fires and lift the loads. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day. We tuck her into bed at night.We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united. We’re the American labor movement and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!Thank you, and God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
202,Trumka Welcomes 116th Congress,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-welcomes-116th-congress,1-10-2019,"Good evening, everybody. I’m Rich Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. Welcome to the House of Labor. Thank you so much for being here.Last week, when I watched this Congress get sworn in, I was filled with pride and hope.The labor movement mobilized for our friends and allies in 2018, including each and every one of you.It worked.We elected more than 960 union members all across this great country.Nancy Pelosi is holding the Speaker’s gavel once again.And somewhere in Wisconsin, Paul Ryan and Scott Walker are starting an Ayn Rand book club.A new Congress offers new beginnings. But unfortunately, you have inherited an unfair and unnecessary government lockout.Every day, our federal employees wake up, go to work and serve our country with honor and distinction.They carry out their oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.And too often, instead of heartfelt thanks, they get ridicule.Their very livelihoods are used for cheap political stunts.Earlier today, the labor movement and our allies rallied in front of this building and delivered a message so loud and so clear that it could be heard on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue: OPEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT ONCE!The House passed a bill. It’s time for the Senate to follow suit. And it’s time for President Trump to log off Twitter and put people back to work.  Instead of building a wall, let’s rebuild our roads and bridges and schools and hospitals.Let’s pass the Workers' Freedom to Negotiate Act, the most sweeping and aggressive labor law reform effort in decades. Thank you Congressman Bobby Scott, chairman of the House Education and LABOR Committee, for your leadership on this legislation. We’re asking all of you to sign on as cosponsors.Let’s raise wages and strengthen unions and expand health care and secure retirement.Let’s fix trade and immigration. And if we really feel the need to shut something down, why don’t we start with tax breaks for corporations?I believe this Congress has the potential for greatness.You are the best representation of America we’ve seen in a long, long time.More women. More people of color. More LGBTQ members than ever before. And we even elected one of our great former staffers here at the AFL-CIO—Congressman Andy Levin of Michigan.The 116th Congress is the group of public servants that can meet this moment of historic collective action with an agenda that delivers a brighter, fairer and more just future for all working people.But first we must end this senseless and manufactured government lockout.And there is no one more battle tested...more dedicated...more ready to deliver...than the Speaker of the House.She’s our champion. And I’m proud to call her my friend.Please welcome Speaker Nancy Pelosi.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
203,Trumka Rallies to Reopen the Government,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-rallies-reopen-government,1-10-2019,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the following remarks at a rally to reopen the government: Good afternoon, everyone. I’m Rich Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO.Brothers and sisters, the government of the United States of America has been shut down for 20 days. Twenty days! If it continues to Saturday, it will become the longest shutdown EVER.And, let’s call this shutdown what it is. It’s a lockout. Hard-working American patriots are being locked out of their jobs for no other reason than the politics of fear. Shame on the Senate! Shame on the White House! This lockout must end, and it must end TODAY!The House passed a bill. It’s time for Mitch McConnell and the Senate to do the same. That’s not a heavy lift. And, instead of going to the border for a photo op, President Trump should be on the Hill negotiating a deal to open the federal government and put people back to work!This week is supposed to be payday for 800,000 federal employees and contractors IN EVERY SINGLE STATE. But, because of these ridiculous divide and distract political games, these workers will not be paid for their service. Let me ask you this: is work without pay okay?These are men and women who took an oath to serve the public. They keep us safe. They care for the sick and the elderly. They help our veterans. And, in the case of a quarter of a million federal employees, they ARE veterans. These workers don’t do it for big bucks or notoriety. They serve because they care. They serve because they love America. And, they deserve to be paid on payday!These are hard-working Americans, and they’re worried about how they’re going to be able to pay for the roof over their heads and put food on the table. They’re worried about how they’re going to survive.You’re going to hear from a number of them today. Folks who are suffering...through no fault of their own and FOR NO GOOD REASON!This lockout is yet another manufactured crisis cooked up by politicians looking to score political points, and American workers are FED UP. We’re tired of being pawns in a game. We’re tired of always being the ones who get hurt. And, we’re not going to take it anymore!So, hear us loud and clear. Stop playing politics with our lives. End this lockout. Open the government. Do your job so we can do ours.Until that happens, we will NOT sit down. We will NOT be silent. We will never stop standing up...and fighting...and marching for every single worker!Because we serve America. We build the roads, bake the bread and lift the loads. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day. We tuck her into bed at night. We are the American labor movement, and we will not...we will not...be denied!© 2023 AFL-CIO.

204,Trumka: Union Members Driving Force in 2018 Election,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-union-members-driving-force-2018-election,11-7-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a post-election press conference: Thanks, Julie (Greene). Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.As Julie explained, we ran a very deliberate political program this cycle. We were focused on having a conversation with our members and ensuring our movement was ready to make our voices heard on Election Day.That’s exactly what happened last night. Union members were a driving force in this election. We fought for our issues, for union candidates and for our proven allies.The result? We’re filling the halls of power with our own. More than 700 union members were elected to office last night...and that number is growing as more results come in. In Nevada, we sent a union member to the United States Senate—Jacky Rosen. We sent another to the governor’s mansion in Michigan—Gretchen Whitmer. Minnesota’s new governor is a union member—Tim Walz. Jahana Hayes and Ilhan  Omar, both union members, broke hard glass ceilings in their winning campaigns for Congress. Colin Allred, an NFLPA member, took down Pete Sessions—as deep-rooted an incumbent as you’ll ever find.We also showed up for our allies...and sent the friends of corporate interests packing.It gave me no small pleasure waking up this morning, knowing that Scott Walker and Bruce Rauner will be packing their bags in the coming weeks.But, it gave me even greater confidence knowing that we’ve elected an army of pro-worker governors in their place, from Wisconsin and Illinois to Nevada to Colorado to Maine to Kansas.Working people took an important step forward last night. From state houses and governor’s mansions to Capitol Hill, we have the support we need to start building the future we deserve. Because, what we saw last night is part of something bigger than politics.All year, I’ve had the pleasure of travelling across the country...listening to union members from all sectors and communities. Autoworkers in Michigan. Culinary workers in Nevada. Public workers in Minnesota. Mineworkers in my home state of Pennsylvania.In every state you were all watching last night...in every working community I visited, there was one common story. Working people are tired of a corporate-controlled government and a corporate-run economy. We’re tired of politicians who listen to the whispers of a few CEOs and ignore the voices of working families. We’re done with a broken system where we work harder and longer than ever before...producing more wealth than ever before...but taking home the same or even less.There’s an energy unlike anything I’ve seen in my fifty years in the labor movement. An urgency to demand something better. We’re organizing. We’re marching. We’re striking. We’re fighting for affordable health care and a secure retirement...for our fundamental rights and dignities on the job. And, as we made clear last night, we’re making ourselves seen on the campaign trail...and making ourselves heard at the ballot box.Given what we saw last night, I have some pretty simple advice for any politician getting ready for the next cycle. If you prove yourself as a genuine ally of working people, we’ll move heaven and earth for you. But, we won’t waste a dime or a door knock on fair weather friends. We made clear last night that we won’t stand for those who prioritize the demands of an elite few—whether they’re anti-labor Republicans or pro-corporate Democrats.Now, Julie and I would be happy to take some questions.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

205,Trumka at USW Election 2018 Rally: Everything Is on the Line,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-usw-election-2018-rally-everything-line,11-2-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the United Steelworkers Election 2018 rally: Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. Thank you, Brother Leo (Gerard)! Let’s give it up for Leo Gerard and the United Steelworkers! This union will always have a special place in my heart.As I start, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tragedy that happened here last weekend. My prayers continue to be with the victims of Tree of Life Synagogue, their families, the Jewish community and the entire Steel city. And, my deepest thanks go out to the first responders...our brothers and sisters on the frontlines...who ran toward danger to help those in need. Four officers were injured, countless others were deeply affected and I wish them all a speedy recovery.This was a senseless act of hatred and violence. And, the ripple effects run deep...not just here in Pittsburgh, but across the country and the world. But, I know Pittsburgh and its people well. This is home. This is where Mr. Rogers taught us what it means to be a good neighbor. This is where steelworkers along the Three Rivers crafted the metals that built the world...while the roots of the American Jewish movement grew in Squirrel Hill. This is a city that...like the labor movement...stands together...in good times, and especially, in dark times.Brothers and sisters...moments like this demand the very best of all of us. For too many years, anti-Semitism and other forms of hate simmered below the surface and on the dark corners of the internet. Now, for personal gain, some politicians have chosen to create a political climate where the abhorrent has become almost mainstream.As the labor movement, we understand better than anyone the urgency of this moment. When rhetoric spills over into violence, it’s our brothers and sisters’ blood shed and lives lost. We are part of every community around the country. And long after the last news crew is gone, we are there with our unions—helping to heal the wounds and pick up the pieces.We cannot allow ourselves to become numb or turn a blind eye. It is up to us to stand up and make clear what we will not accept. Change starts with us... with working people. It is up to us to hold every politician and person in power accountable—not only for their actions, but for their words and for their silence.Everything we are and hope to be is on the line right now. This election on Tuesday is bigger than any politician or party. Our entire future is on the ballot. This is our chance to show that ordinary people….ordinary workers...can rise up and demand a better path forward for every person.Standing here before you, it’s hard not to think about my own family. I’m a third generation coal miner from Nemacolin. And I carry Western Pennsylvania with me every single day. I grew up here. I learned about solidarity here. I experienced the union difference here.Early in the morning, my father used to say to me: “Another day. Another dollar. Down in the hole.” He earned his living underground. But he found his passion and purpose up here on these streets in the United Mine Workers of America.You see, brothers and sisters, coal jobs didn’t just become good jobs. Steel jobs didn’t just become good jobs. Auto jobs and construction jobs and public sector jobs didn’t just become good jobs. We made them good jobs! The labor movement did that! And I’ll be damned if we’re going to let any politician take that away from us!Our movement...our values...our way of life...it’s all at stake Tuesday. This region has always gone above and beyond for the country we love. Pennsylvania played a crucial role in the Civil War, supplying 360,000 soldiers for the Union side. The battle at Gettysburg—not far from where we gather today—changed the course of history.I’m a student of the Civil War. It’s my hobby. I’m amazed that in every story, every battle, they talk about the generals. But they never mention the foot soldiers. The common man and common woman who joined together to do uncommon things. Let me tell you: that’s how I feel today. You are those men and women. You have the power to change the world.Just look at what’s happening in America. 262,000 new members joined unions in 2017. Three-quarters of them were under the age of 35. Gallup just put our popularity at 62 percent—a 15-year high. We repealed right to work in Missouri with more than 67 percent of the vote. And new research from MIT shows that half of non-union workers would vote for a union today if given the chance. That’s more than 60 million people—the population of Italy!This election is our chance to take another step forward. And let me tell you something: the union-busters are scared. In that great Missouri victory, the Chamber of Commerce said that, for every punch they threw, working people threw ten more. And even the Wall Street Journal warned CEOs that unions are on the attack. Well, I’ve got news for them: you ain't seen nothing yet!This election is a fundamental choice between two competing ideas. The first says corporations are people, wealth trickles down and workers can just fend for themselves. The second says workers have dignity and rights and unions are good for America. The first gives cover to discrimination, bigotry and hate. The second says America is the land of the free and the home of the brave and I don’t care if you’re black, white, gay, straight, trans, immigrant, native born, Christian, Jewish or Muslim...this is our country and we’re going to fight for it!That’s what Tuesday is all about. We get to be the deciding factor in where this country goes. Working together, we can fill the halls of power with union members and allies.That’s why we’ve got to get out the vote to re-elect Governor Tom Wolf. From the moment he took office, he’s been a champion of working people. He’s invested billions of dollars in infrastructure, job training and education. He’s fought back against every attack on collective bargaining. He expanded Medicaid. And that’s just in four years. Imagine what we can accomplish together with another four.We’ve got to get out the vote to re-elect Senator Bob Casey. Bobby has been there for us time and again. He understands there is no middle class without the labor movement. He’s voted to lift our wages, protect our health care and pensions and strengthen the freedom to organize. We need Bob Casey in the U.S. Senate.We’ve got to get out the vote for our friends in the U.S. House of Representatives. Congressman Conor Lamb got this momentum started in April by running as an unapologetic supporter of unions. Let’s help secure him the full term he deserves. And let’s send Congressman Mike Doyle and every other worker advocate into the halls of power with him, from Harrisburg to our nation’s capital.Each of you here today...you can get us there. You are our greatest asset. We need your passion. When you talk to your coworkers...when you talk to your friends and family...that’s how progress is won!So as I wrap up, I’ll leave you with two messages. The first is thank you. Thanks for being here and for caring. For spending some time away from your kids, grandkids and family.And my second message is this: VOTE UNION!Don’t vote Republican or Democrat. Don’t vote liberal or conservative. Don’t vote red or blue. VOTE UNION!For higher wages and quality, affordable health care...vote union!To protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security from Mitch McConnell and his cronies...vote union!For the freedom to organize and bargain collectively...vote union!For the infrastructure we deserve...vote union!For trade that actually lifts workers up for a change...vote union!For an America free from hate…vote union!For our founders...for our children...for each other...VOTE UNION...VOTE UNION...VOTE UNION!That’s what today’s about. Getting our members to vote union. Come Tuesday, we’re going to choose a path that makes this economy and political system work for workers one more time. And the uncommon thing that you’re going to do together as common men and women will change the direction of this country.Because we’re the ones who wake America up every single day, and put her to bed at night. We roll the steel. We make the tires. We build the roads and stoke the fires. We’ll stand strong. We’ll never run and hide. We’re the American labor movement, and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!

Thank you! God bless you all!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
206,Trumka at UMWA Inauguration: Listen to Working People,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-umwa-inauguration-listen-working-people,11-1-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the United Mine Workers of America inauguration of international officers and district representatives:Good morning, brothers and sisters. Brother Bob (Phalen), thank you for that introduction. Senator (Joe) Manchin, Congressman (David) McKinley, Sister Sara (Nelson), thank you all for being here to mark this auspicious occasion. And to the newly elected leaders of the UMWA: President Cecil Roberts, Secretary-Treasurer Levi Allen, Don Barnett, James Gibbs, Donnie Samms, Chuck Knisell, Steve Earle, Gary Trout, Larry Spencer, Mike Dalpiaz, Rick Altman, Roy Fernandez, Tanya James and Jody Dukart...congratulations. You get to represent the greatest union members in the world.36 years ago, on Christmas week at the Charleston Civic Center, I raised my right hand and took the oath of office as president of the United Mine Workers of America. I was 33. It was one of the greatest days of my life. I was sworn in by my dad, who gave his heart and his life to this union...and Biondi Vecchiolla, a pensioner from my hometown of Nemacolin, Pennsylvania, who was a mentor and a friend. I am older today than my father was then. Man, how time flies.Earlier this year, I received my 50-year pin in this union. The UMWA is who I am. It’s who I’ll always be. My job at the AFL-CIO has afforded me the opportunity to meet with presidents and prime ministers. I’ve traveled the world. But no association has ever given me more pride than being president of the Mine Workers. At my inauguration in 1982, in a room filled with emotion and passion and hope, I said: “I do not hesitate to proclaim to the world that you represent the best that America has to offer.” Brothers and sisters, I feel the same way today.Standing before you, it’s impossible not to be filled with immense gratitude. I’ve been so blessed. I think about the great partners I’ve had in this journey. People like Cecil Roberts, John Banovic, Jerry Jones, Carlo Turley, Paul Lemmon, Rich Barchesi and Bob Long. These are the men who raised me, who inspire me and who taught me about unionism and life.These are the men who helped put this union back where it belongs: in the hands of its members. Before democracy won out at the UMWA, you couldn’t see your own contract. If you thought you had a grievance, you’d be told, “No. You’ll have a grievance when I tell you you have a grievance.” It was a recipe for corruption, and all the ills that go along with it: worse pay and more accidents and injuries, more roof falls, more Black Lung and more death.I’m a student of the Civil War. It’s my hobby. I’m amazed that in every story, every battle, they talk about the generals. But they never mention the foot soldiers. The common man and common woman who joined together to do uncommon things. That’s what we did with Miners for Democracy. We said the UMWA was put on this earth for its members to have a better life, not for its leaders to have a higher status. And you could feel a changing of the guard that day at the Charleston Civic Center. It was the first time we held our inauguration in coal country. It was the first time this event was opened up to the rank and file membership. And one thing I remember on that beautiful, sunny day, is that people stopped looking at their shoes. They didn’t look down anymore. This was their union.That is the legacy you are charged with carrying on today. And I can’t think of a finer group of men and women to do it. The most important piece of advice I can give you is to listen more and talk less. Leadership is listening. Democracy is listening. That's how we are able to understand the message people are trying to tell us.Working people are delivering a message in America today. We are sick and tired of an economy and a political system that doesn’t work for us. We are embracing the fundamental truth that the best way to raise our own standing in life is by standing with the person next to us.For the past two years, pundits have been trying to figure out exactly what happened in 2016. Well, the people in this room can tell you the answer. The 2016 election was an indictment of political elites in both parties that for too long have embraced policies that hold down wages, increase inequality, diminish opportunity and ship American jobs overseas. Donald Trump offered a different face and a different voice and promised to deliver change to working people, and especially to our coal communities. Well, he’s changed things alright, further entrenching power in the hands of the wealthy elite.Brothers and sisters, the change voters cried out for in 2016 can be found by standing together in unions. 262,000 new members joined us last year. Three-quarters of them were under the age of 35. Gallup just put our popularity at 62 percent—a 15-year high. New research from MIT shows that half of non-union workers would vote for a union today if given the chance. And I am confident that we’re going to build on this momentum next week by electing union members and our allies to office all over the country, no matter what political party they happen to belong to.I stand before you today as hopeful as I was Christmas 1982. Collective action is on the rise. Unionism is on the move. And the United Mine Workers of America, as always, is at the center of it all. God bless this union. God bless this country. And God bless each and every one of you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
207,Trumka Highlights Labor's Ascension in Land of Janus,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-highlights-labors-ascension-land-janus,10-19-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks accepting the Northeastern Illinois Federation of Labor's 23rd Annual Person of the Year Award.Thank you, Brother Mike (Carrigan), for that overly kind introduction. You and Tim (Drea) are doing an incredible job leading the labor movement forward in this state. I also want to recognize Pat (Statter) and Sue (Gilbert) for their great work here in Lake and McHenry counties. And, my thanks to Ron and Steve (Powell) from Local 881 UFCW for your decades of leadership in Chicago, and Brother Bob (Reiter)...congratulations on your recent election.Congressman (Brad) Schneider, thank you for being a true friend of labor.And, to the entire Northeastern Illinois Federation: Thank you for this award. I’m deeply honored.You know, Mike is an award winner, too. If you hadn’t heard, he recently became the first person from Illinois to receive the World Peace Prize and be recognized as a Roving Ambassador for Peace. It’s a well-deserved honor.And, Pat, I heard that you’re celebrating 35 years with the Northeastern Illinois Federation this week. Congratulations, brother. I was proud to earn my 50-year pin from the United Mine Workers earlier this year.You know, I looked it up, and for the 35th anniversary, you’re supposed to get gifts of coral. But, I’ll tell you, Brother Pat, I didn’t bring you any tonight. Because when you think about it, coral retreats when in danger.And, that’s not what you do here in Illinois. You don’t turn and run. You stand and fight!It’s that Prairie State attitude that’s changing the direction of not just Illinois, but our entire nation.Brothers and sisters: Something is happening in America. Collective action is on the rise, and it’s one of the most exciting things I’ve experienced in a very long time.The teacher strikes. #MeToo. Black Lives Matter. Students speaking out for safer schools. Marriott workers demanding that “One job should be enough.”From coast to coast, and all through the heartland of America, ordinary people are recognizing that the best way to win is by standing with the person next to us. And as a labor movement, it’s our job to ignite the flames of justice, not contain them.Working people are rising up. Look at what we did in Missouri this summer: With more than 67 percent of the vote, we sent right to work into the garbage where it belongs!We spoke to members at more than 1,000 different worksites. We knocked more than 800,000 doors. And, we made more than 1 million phone calls....talking about good union jobs and the power of collective action.And, it wasn’t even close! Democrats voted no. Half of Republicans voted no. 937,000 Missourians...from every community and background...stood up together and said hell no!The Chamber of Commerce said that, for every punch they threw, working people threw ten more. Even the Wall Street Journal editorial board warned CEOs that unions are on the attack.Damn right, we are!And, we’re rallying our own like never before. Last month in Chicago, our IBEW brothers and sisters held their largest organizing conference ever, training 1,800 organizers to recruit others to join our movement.Americans are paying attention to unions and what we can offer. 262,000 new members joined unions in 2017....and here’s the best part...three quarters of them were under the age of 35. We’re rallying the next generation to our cause, and Gallup just put our popularity at 62 percent—a 15-year high. New research from MIT shows that half of non-union workers would vote for a union today if given the chance. That’s more than 60 million people—the population of Italy.And, who could blame them! We transform lives!Economists at Princeton have confirmed what we’ve known all along...unions raise wages up to 20 percent...decade after decade.And, that’s not all: We negotiate quality benefits….a reasonable work schedule….and a voice on the job. We make work safe and retirement secure. We build the economic future that our kids and grandkids deserve!But this is about more than dollars and cents: it’s about a better life, for all working people, no matter who you love or how you worship, no matter the color of your skin or where you were born.   Unions have always been at the core of this country’s fundamental promise, and I’ll be damned if we’re going to stop now!This is the year of the worker. We’re rising together to reject an economy that only works for a handful of elites. We rising together to demand better.Brothers and sisters, hear me loud and clear: We will not back down or settle for less! We won’t be silenced! We won’t be tossed aside! And, we sure as hell won’t sit down and shut up!Let’s reclaim America for working people!Let’s reclaim the future for our kids!Let’s show every robber baron and corporate hack that we aren’t going anywhere!We love this country! We built her from the ground up...and we’re TAKING...HER...BACK!Brothers and sisters, we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us here in Northeastern Illinois. We have the power to change the status quo. In the end, this is more than just an election. This is our make it or break it moment. This is our future.So, we’ve got to stand behind the people who stand behind us. It doesn’t matter if they have “D”, “R” or “I” after their name. If you fight for us, we’ll fight like hell for you.That’s why we’re proud to support real allies like Congressman Schneider. He has stood up for the rights of workers to collectively bargain and repeatedly fought against attempts to repeal prevailing wage. Brothers and sisters, I want him fighting for us back in Washington, and I know you do, too!Lauren Underwood is going to join him as a fierce advocate for working people in the House.We’re going to send Peter Roskam back into the arms of his corporate cronies, and elect Sean Casten as the next Congressman in the 6th District!And, when we elect a pro-worker majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Illinois is going to be a big reason why.But make no mistake, the labor movement’s fight isn’t just about the halls of Congress. We’re pushing just as hard at the state and local level.And, on November 6th...on that sweet, sweet night...we’re going to stand shoulder-to-shoulder, raise our fists high in the air and tell Bruce Rauner to get the hell outta here!We’re going to cut Bruce loose.The nerve this guy has.He refused to pass a budget...for two years!He raised taxes, but refused to raise the minimum wage.He underfunded pensions, yet he kept the state in the red.And, he tried repeatedly to repeal prevailing wage and Project Labor Agreements.Bruce Rauner tried over and over again to pass right to work, gut collective bargaining and silence workers.Remember his “Turnaround Agenda?” Well, he sure turned things around, alright... and around....and around again until he sent Illinois on a downward spiral that was only stopped by some good folks in Springfield. Our folks.No wonder the conservative National Review calls him “The Worst Republican Governor in America!” They can drop the word “Republican”, and they’d still be right.We all know how gleeful Rauner was to file a lawsuit against the labor movement. He was like Mr. Scrooge on pay day.And, when he was eventually booted off the case, his powerful corporate friends swooped in and recruited Mark Janus, a former state worker in Springfield, who told reporters that he thought collective bargaining is “beneficial to people and workers.”Hey, at least you got that right, Mark!Look, brothers and sisters, we know the truth: This case was never about Mark Janus. He was a political pawn recruited by Bruce Rauner’s corporate buddies to try and take down working people.And after using his name to screw over public employees nationwide, Janus quit his job as a child support specialist and became a senior fellow with the right-wing Illinois Policy Institute.This is politics at its absolute worst.So now Bruce Rauner has the gall to ask the working people he sold out to let him keep his job?I’ve got two words for you, Bruce: HELL NO!But we can’t ride a wave to victory. It takes work!So, I need you to volunteer. I need you to door knock and phone bank. If you haven’t yet, send local union mail to your members. Have conversations at the worksite. Come join us for a labor walk tomorrow morning at IFT Local 504. 9 a.m. sharp!Brothers and sisters, in 18 days, we’re going to fire Bruce Rauner once and for all.We’re going to elect J.B. Pritzker as the next governor of the great state of Illinois!And, we’re going to take back this state for ALL working people!When I think about the attacks against us...from corporations...from the Supreme Court...from anti-worker politicians like Bruce Rauner...I get angry. And sometimes, I even get discouraged.But on the darkest of days, I remember something my grandmother used to tell me. Stana tupe benne. In Italian, it means: from everything comes some good.Now you might be wondering….what good can come from Janus and the proposals to gut our health care and financial and retirement security? What good can come from a Supreme Court that rules with corporations 90 percent of the time and just gave Brett Kavanaugh the biggest promotion of his life?What good can come from a governor and a president who have used their power and office to actively hurt working people?Here’s the answer: The vicious attacks on our unions have brought us closer together.Our bond is stronger. Our memory is longer.Remember, throughout the entire history of our movement, we’ve never had anything handed to us.Every speck of progress was clawed from the hands of those who said we were asking too much...who tried to destroy us with one hand and dismissed us as radicals with the other. They considered us a conspiracy in restraint of trade. They said dignity...fairness...a safe job...were too much to ask.In the face of seemingly insurmountable opposition, we steadily built a fairer economy and a more just society...because we had one advantage on our side: Solidarity.Solidarity overcame their money and power.American greatness...American decency...the American Dream itself was built through solidarity...as workers joined arms and marched forward as one in common cause.Each time they fired us...or shot at us...or told us to sit down and shut up...we grew stronger.Bonded by a common struggle, working people kept fighting and discovered a fundamental truth that carries us to this day: You can’t stop ALL of us.We are an unassailable force when—and only when—we stand together.I remember back when my son Richard was young—maybe three or four years old. He and his buddy Chad were driving around in the backyard in one of those battery operated jeeps.He must have heard me talking on the phone, because he drove up and asked: “Dad, what’s a union?”So, I told him to get out of the jeep and try to push it up the hill in our backyard. He strained and struggled, but he couldn’t get it up the hill. Then I told his friend Chad to give him a hand. Working together, they got the job done. I looked right at my son and said: “That’s a union...people doing things together that they can’t do alone.”Against all odds, the labor movement is climbing that hill. Today, there is a multi-billion dollar industry dedicated to destroying us.Well, guess what? We’re still standing.And we’re not just surviving. We’re growing. We’re marching. We’re striking. We’re winning.Unions are on the move. In every city and every state. Young and old. Black and white. Immigrant and native-born. Gay and straight. Rural and urban. Republican and Democrat.We’re rising in solidarity…real solidarity…where your picket line is my picket line, and my picket line is your picket line.We’re spoiling for a fight. I say, bring it on! We've taken their best shot, and we're still standing. We’re the true American patriots. We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united.Because we’re the ones who wake our nation up every single morning. We tuck her into bed at night. We build the ships and mine the coal. We lift the loads. We pour the molds. We connect our cities and the world. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We make this country strong.We don’t duck and run. We don’t run and hide.We’re the American labor movement, and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!Thank you! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
208,Trumka to Roofers and Waterproofers: American Dream Built Through Solidarity,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-roofers-and-waterproofers-american-dream-built-through-solidarity,10-11-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Roofers and Waterproofers Convention: Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. It is a privilege and an honor to be here today. Thank you, Brother Kinsey (Robinson), for that overly kind introduction. You’re a great leader and a true friend. As I begin, I want to recognize all the support you’ve given to the Union Sportsmen’s Alliance over the years. You understand the importance of preserving our outdoor heritage through collective action. You’ve helped make USA one of the most prominent forces in conservation. And most of all, you’ve helped bring union members together in common passion and purpose to enjoy and protect the land that we love. Thank you, brother. I look forward to our next hunt.The theme of your convention—Recruit, Train, Retain—is a rallying cry for the entire labor movement. To succeed, we must grow. To grow, we must secure our ranks. And to secure our ranks, we must demonstrate value to our members. These are the building blocks of trade unionism. Recruitment, training and retention is how we win a future that is fair and just for working people. It’s how we make the American Dream a reality for more families. And let me tell you this: No one does it better than the United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers. No one!I have a woman on my staff named Prairie Wells. She’s a third-generation union member. In 1980, she was living with her mother and sister in Lake Placid, New York, around the time of the Winter Olympics.Her mother Sarah had just endured a difficult breakup with Prairie’s father. They had nothing. Sarah moved her girls to Rochester with little more than the clothes on their back. At a Halloween party that year, Sarah bumped into an old friend from high school who had started a business and could use a good hand. Opportunity knocked. And Sarah answered. She became a roofer and a member of Local 22.It was the hardest work she had ever done. “Oh my dear,” is how she described her first week on the job. During her lunch break, she would sometimes rest in her car and fall asleep. One of her union brothers would always wake her up. “I had backup,” Sarah said.Before she found this union, Sarah described herself as “broke and broken.” But a union card changed everything. Now, Sarah could take her kids to the doctor when they got sick. She got regular paychecks. She got an apartment of her own. She was able to keep her car and pay the bills.But union membership was more than dollars and cents for Sarah. She walked taller. She held her head higher. She treasured the peace of mind that comes with being able to support your family through hard work. Sarah would often drive around town and point out the fruits of her labor. The roller skating rink where Prairie and her friends hung out—her mom installed the roof. And everybody knew it! “The union changed my life,” Sarah said.Brothers and sisters, I share Sarah’s story as a reminder of why we each carry a union card in our pocket...of why we organize and mobilize and fight together.These are extremely difficult times for our country. Our economy doesn’t work for too many of us. Our politics are badly broken.But there is still one force for good...one united front advancing the cause of social and economic justice...fighting for dignity and hope...and that's the labor movement!It's each of you, brothers and sisters!We have the power to reclaim America for the people who build it and make it work! For Sarah...for every mom and dad who’s given everything they have just to survive!It’s time to fight like hell...to end the injustice still plaguing us...to end the indignity we still face...to end the inequality still wrecking our country...to end the egregious idea that exploitation is the cost of doing business.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?This is our country...and it’s high time...HIGH TIME...we took it back!You know, there are some folks out there who could learn a lot from people like Sarah...from just about anyone in this room. Just a few weeks ago, Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, tweeted what he seemed to think was a profound question.How can we raise wages for working people? What's one thing we can do? A unicorn for the middle-class, he called it.Brothers and sisters, we don’t need a unicorn to lift people out of poverty. There’s no secret here. We know the answer. WE ARE THE ANSWER! If you want an economy that works for working people...if you want a society that is fair and just...if you want opportunity and mobility and dignity, then you can start by giving everyone in this country the right to bargain with our employers for good wages and benefits. You see, Eric Schmidt already had his unicorn. All he had to do was Google the American labor movement.And if he did, he’d know that unions are on the rise. Something is happening in America, brothers and sisters. It's one of the most exciting things I’ve seen in my 50 years in the labor movement.262,000 working people joined unions last year...and three quarters of them were under 35. Our approval rating is at a 15-year high and rising. Half of all non-union workers would vote TODAY to join a union if given the chance. That’s more than 60 million people—the population of Italy.After the Supreme Court ruled against us in Janus, many pundits wondered if it would be the death of the labor movement. Well, brothers and sisters, they got their answer!Just look at Missouri. The state legislature there tried to ram through a so-called “right to work” law. They tried to override the will of their constituents and strip working people of our economic rights. We didn’t stand for it. We fought back by doing what we do best. We organized!We needed 100,000 signatures to put right to work on the ballot. We got 300,000!We visited 1,000 worksites. We knocked on 800,000 doors. We made a million calls. We mobilized our brothers and sisters. We talked to our neighbors, union and non-union alike.And on August 7, we sent that egregious law into the ash heap of history. It wasn’t even close!Democrats voted no. Half of Republicans voted no. Two out of every three Missourians who cast a ballot voted no.The Chamber of Commerce said that, for every punch they threw, working people threw ten more back. Even the Wall Street Journal warned CEOs that unions are on the attack.Hell yeah, we are!By crushing right to work in Missouri, the labor movement made it crystal clear that no politician or Supreme Court decision is going to stop us from organizing and fighting for working people.We’re riding this wave into November, mobilizing the largest and most strategic grassroots electoral campaign in our history.Working together, we can fill the halls of power with union members and allies...no matter what political party they happen to belong to.  Each of you in this room...you can get us there. You are our greatest asset. We need your passion. When you talk to your coworkers...when you talk to your friends and family...that’s how progress is won!I don’t know about you, but I’m sick and tired of Republicans who treat us like punching bags. And I’m just as tired of Democrats who treat us like ATMs, cashing our checks and then forgetting who got them elected in the first place.So my message to you is this: don’t vote Republican or Democrat. Don’t vote liberal or conservative. Don’t vote red or blue. VOTE UNION!For higher wages and quality, affordable health care...vote union!To protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security...vote union!For the freedom to organize and bargain collectively...vote union!For the infrastructure we deserve...vote union!For trade that actually lifts workers up...vote union!For our members...for America...for each other.VOTE UNION! VOTE UNION! VOTE UNION!Brothers and sisters, when I think about the attacks against us...from corporations...from the Supreme Court...from too many politicians...I get angry. And sometimes, I even get discouraged.But on the darkest of days, I remember something my grandmother used to tell me. Stana tupe benne. In Italian, it means: from everything comes some good.Now you might be wondering….what good can come from right to work and Janus and the proposals to gut our financial, health care and retirement security?The answer is this. The vicious attacks on our unions have brought us closer together.Our bond is stronger. Our memory is longer.Remember, throughout the entire history of our movement, we’ve never had anything handed to us.Every speck of progress was clawed from the hands of those who said we were asking too much...who tried to destroy us with one hand and dismissed us as radicals with the other. They considered us a conspiracy in restraint of trade. They said dignity...fairness...a safe job...were too much to ask.In the face of seemingly insurmountable opposition, we steadily built a fairer economy and a more just society...because we had one advantage on our side: Solidarity.American greatness...American decency...the American Dream itself was built through solidarity...as workers joined arms and marched forward as one in common cause.Each time they fired us...or shot at us...or told us to sit down and shut up...we grew stronger.Bonded by a common struggle, working people kept fighting and discovered a fundamental truth that carries us to this day: You can’t stop ALL of us.We are an unassailable force when—and only when—we stand together.I remember back when my son Richard was young—maybe three or four years old. He and his buddy Chad were driving around in the backyard in one of those battery operated jeeps.He must have heard me talking on the phone, because he drove up and asked: “Dad, what’s a union?”So I told him to get out of the jeep and try to push it up the hill in our backyard. He strained and struggled, but he couldn’t get it up the hill. Then I told his friend Chad to give him a hand. Working together, they got the job done. I looked right at my son and said: “That’s a union...people doing things together that they can’t do alone.”On the shores of Lake Ontario, Sarah Wells found hope and a better life in that union.In the coalfields of Pennsylvania, my family found purpose and a path forward in that union.On the roofs of Spokane, Washington, Kinsey Robinson found his voice in that union.I know each of you could tell a similar story.And as long as I have breath in these lungs, I will not rest until EVERY WORKER has that same opportunity.So, our enemies want a fight? I say, bring it on! We've taken their best shot, and we're still standing.We’re the true American patriots. We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united. We’re rising in solidarity…real solidarity…where your picket line is my picket line, and my picket line is your picket line.Because we’re the ones who wake our nation up every single morning. We tuck her into bed at night. We build the roofs and mine the coal. We lift the loads. We pour the molds. We connect our cities and the world. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We make this country strong. We don’t duck and run. We don’t run and hide. We’re the American labor movement, and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!Thank you. God bless you all!© 2023 AFL-CIO.

209,Trumka: Wisconsin Uprising Helped Spur Wave of Collective Action,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-wisconsin-uprising-helped-spur-wave-collective-action,9-25-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Wisconsin AFL-CIO Convention:Good morning, brothers and sisters. It is great to be back in Wisconsin. Thank you, Brother Phil (Neuenfeldt), for that introduction. You and Sister Stephanie (Bloomingdale) are doing an incredible job leading this labor movement forward. Sister Stephanie—congratulations on your election and on becoming the first woman to lead the Wisconsin AFL-CIO. As some of you may be aware, Phil is undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment for cancer. Phil—I want to tell you something today from the bottom of my heart. It’s not just the drugs fighting those cancerous cells. It’s all of us. Every worker. Every union. We’re inspired by your courage. We’ve got your back. And I’ll tell you what: cancer has met its match!You see, Phil is a fighter. And the labor movement here in Wisconsin knows a thing or two about fighting the good fight. It’s been a difficult seven years. The attacks are relentless. Our opponents are shameless. There’s been defeats and false starts. Yet through perseverance and sheer grit, we are starting to turn the tide. Workers are on the march again. We’re writing a comeback story. And I believe the hope and progress of 2018 was made possible by the heroes of 2011. On a cold winter day that February, I joined tens of thousands of protestors at the State Capitol in Madison. The sights and scenes took my breath away. The author and journalist, John Nichols, a Madison native, called it an uprising.Brothers and sisters, the seeds you planted in 2011 and nourished in the years that followed are alive and well today. 262,000 new members joined unions in 2017...and here’s the best part...three quarters of them were under the age of 35. Gallup just did a poll that found our approval at 62 percent...a 15-year high. And new research from MIT shows half of non-union workers would vote to organize today if given the chance. That’s more than 60 million people!Something is happening in America. Collective action is on the rise. It's unlike anything I’ve seen in my 50 years in the labor movement.The teacher strikes. #MeToo. Black Lives Matter. Students speaking out for safer schools.From coast to coast, and all over the heartland of America, ordinary people are recognizing that the best way to win is by standing with the person next to us. And as a labor movement, it is our job to ignite the flames of justice, not contain them.That’s what we did in Missouri. Last month, voters there went to the polls to decide the future of right to work. And with more than 67 percent of the vote, the Show Me State sent that horrible law into the ash heap of history. It wasn’t even close! Democrats voted no. Half of Republicans voted no.After the Supreme Court ruled against us in Janus, many pundits wondered if it would be the death of the labor movement. Well, brothers and sisters, they got their answer! The Chamber of Commerce said that, for every punch they threw, working people threw ten more. Even the Wall Street Journal warned CEOs that unions are on the attack.Hell yeah, we are!We’re fighting with everything we’ve got...to end the injustice plaguing us...to end the indignity we face...to end the inequality paralyzing our country...to end the egregious idea that exploitation is the cost of doing business.This is our time to reclaim America for the people who build it and make it work!Remember, throughout the entire history of our movement, we’ve never had anything handed to us.Frederick Douglass once said, “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.”Brothers and sisters, time and time again, we have fought for every victory. We bled to secure our right to stand together and bargain collectively. We marched and sacrificed to end child labor. We faced down the powers of Washington and Wall Street to win a minimum wage.In the face of seemingly insurmountable opposition, we steadily built a fairer economy and a more just society...because we had one advantage on our side: Solidarity.American greatness...American decency...the American Dream itself was built through solidarity...as workers joined arms and marched forward as one in common cause.Each time they insulted us...or fired us...or shot at us...we grew stronger.Bonded by a common struggle, working people kept fighting and discovered a fundamental truth that carries us to this day: You can’t stop all of us.We are an unassailable force when—and only when—we stand together.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?We won’t be silenced. We won’t be pushed around. We won’t be walked over, talked over or told to sit down and shut up. We will not settle for less.Because this is our country...and it’s time...IT’S HIGH TIME...we took it back!Now, I love Penn State. But on November 6, I want to be singing “On Wisconsin.” Already this year, our endorsed candidate won a special election in Wisconsin’s 10th Senate District. This is an area that went for Romney and Trump by huge margins. But union members and our allies banded together to win 55 percent of the vote!Already this year, we’ve sent an ally to the State Senate in the 1st District, flipping another seat into pro-worker hands.Already this year, we’ve carried a friend to the Wisconsin Supreme Court with an overwhelming statewide victory, ensuring that a voice for justice and fairness will preside for the next 10 years.Are you noticing a pattern?The uprising that started in Madison has made its way to Milwaukee and Kenosha and Green Bay. And six weeks from today, we’re going to end the era of union-busting in this state.Brothers and sisters, we’re going to send Tammy Baldwin back to the U.S. Senate.We’re going to send Randy Bryce to Congress because Washington can always use another trade unionist with a mustache.We’re going to continue to elect union members and allies at all levels of government, from the school board to the State Senate.And on November 6, we’re going to have a party. Scott Walker’s retirement party.It’ll be at a union hotel. It’ll be catered and served by union labor. We’re going to gather around and thank Governor Walker for helping to bring us together.And then, we’re going to put his ass on a bus.Scott Walker is a liar. He’s a fraud. He’s a national disgrace. Some baseball games have lasted longer than his presidential campaign.And now he wants the people of Wisconsin to give him another term. After Act 10. After right to work. After repealing prevailing wage and Project Labor Agreements. After his policies drove down wages and union membership and turned a surplus into a deficit.I don’t think so.Did you hear what Scott Walker said last week? He complained that Tony Evers is bought and paid for by unions. First of all, this is ironic coming from a man who was basically adopted by the Koch Brothers. Secondly, think about what he’s really saying. Scott Walker wants you to believe ""union"" is a dirty word.Well, I have a message for him. Unions are the women and men who’ve bravely responded to the recent wave of flooding and tornadoes here in Wisconsin. Unions are the teachers who educate our kids and the nurses who care for our aging parents. Unions are the electrical workers who help light up Lambeau Field and the housekeepers and bartenders serving us here at the Hyatt.We are the union.And, six weeks from today, we’re going to end Scott Walker’s reign over Wisconsin once and for all. We’re going to send Tony Evers to the Governor’s Mansion and finally...FINALLY...take back this state for working people!Brothers and sisters, when I think about the attacks against us...from corporations...from the Supreme Court...from anti-worker politicians like Scott Walker...I get angry. And sometimes, I even get discouraged.But on the darkest of days, I remember something my grandmother used to tell me. Stana tupe benne. In Italian, it means: from everything comes some good.Now you might be wondering….what good can come from Act 10 and Janus and the proposals to gut our financial, health care and retirement security? What good can come from a Supreme Court that rules with corporations 90 percent of the time and a nominee like Brett Kavanaugh who would push that number even higher?What good can come from a governor and a president who have used their office to actively hurt working people?The answer is this. The vicious attacks on our unions have brought us closer together.I had a high school football coach named Bear Stuvek. Bear was one tough son of a miner. He taught me about perseverance and dedication and good, old-fashioned hard work. Bear used to put us through a drill called “Bull in the Ring.” I am certain it would be banned today.Twelve of my teammates would circle around me. Bear would count off...1, 2, 3, 4...1, 2, 3, 4. He’d call the ones. They’d come and hit me. Then the twos. Then the threes and so on. Bear would keep calling their numbers. And I’d keep getting hit harder and harder. Sometimes I’d be on the ground and wonder whether I should get up. Somehow I always did.Before long, when Bear would put me in that ring, I’d start hitting back. I’d hit back with everything I had. I’d hit back until they finally got the message that while you may knock me down, you will never...and I mean never...knock me out.The labor movement...especially here in Wisconsin...we are that bull in the ring. We’ve been getting hit over and over again. Every day. From every direction. They’ve held down our pay. They’ve attacked our health care. They’ve tried to kill our pensions, destroy our jobs and leave us begging for scraps.Well guess what? Their time is up. Unions are on the move. In every city and every state. Young and old. Black and white. Immigrant and native-born. Gay and straight. Rural and urban. Republican and Democrat.We’re spoiling for a fight. I say, bring it on! We've taken their best shot, and we're still standing. We’re the true American patriots. We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united.We’re rising in solidarity…real solidarity…where your picket line is my picket line, and my picket line is your picket line.We’re fighting together and marching together. We're organizing and striking and voting for the dignity that we deserve! We're showing every robber baron and corporate hack that we’re here to stay!Because we’re the ones who wake our nation up every single morning. We tuck her into bed at night. We build the ships and mine the coal. We lift the loads. We pour the molds. We connect our cities and the world. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We make this country strong.We don’t duck and run. We don’t run and hide.We’re the American labor movement, and we will not...WE WILL NOT...be denied!Thank you! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO.

210,Trumka to Ohio AFL-CIO Convention: You Can't Stop All of Us ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-ohio-afl-cio-convention-you-cant-stop-all-us,9-19-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Ohio AFL-CIO Convention: Thank you, Brian (Malloy)!Brother Tim (Burga)...Sister Petee (Talley)...thank you for your leadership and all that you do for working people here in Ohio.Brothers and sisters, I am so grateful for the time and passion that each of you give to this movement every single day. I consider it an honor to fight alongside you. And, as long as my Nittany Lions beat the Buckeyes next week, I think it’ll stay that way.But for now, it’s good to be back in Columbus. It’s good to be surrounded by family.Because we face plenty of challenges in the months and years ahead. Our opponents are more shameless than ever. And we have more at stake than ever.At times like these, I think it’s helpful to consider where we’ve been.131 years ago, working people from across the country descended on this city. Drawn from all trades and walks of life, they stood together, here in Columbus. They declared, “A struggle is going on between the oppressors and the oppressed...a struggle between the capitalist and the laborer.”They huddled together and resolved to fight...to fight and win that struggle. They called on the workers of our country to permanently unite...to secure the rights to which they were justly entitled.They put it to paper...they signed their names...and they formed the American Federation of Labor.Brothers and sisters, that’s our legacy. Their struggle is our struggle. Their fight is our fight. It lives on in our federation...in our unions...and in each of you.Are you ready to carry that forward? Are you ready to realize their dream?It’s time to fight like hell...to end the injustice still plaguing us...to end the indignity we face...to end the inequality paralyzing our country...to end the egregious idea that exploitation is the cost of doing business.This is our time to reclaim America for the people who build it and make it work!Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?We won’t be silenced. We won’t be pushed around. We won’t be walked over, talked over or told to sit down and shut up. We will not settle for less.Because this is our country...and it’s time...it’s high time we took it back!Something is happening in America, brothers and sisters. Can you feel it? It's unlike anything I’ve seen in my 50 years in the labor movement.262,000 working people joined unions last year...and three quarters of them were under 35. Our approval rating is at a 15-year high and rising. Half of all non-union workers would vote TODAY to join a union if given the chance.We’re marching. We’re striking. We’re running for office. And, we’re winning.I don’t care how cynical you are. Something is going on.Just look at Missouri. The state legislature tried to ram through a so-called “right to work” law. They tried to override the will of their constituents and strip working people of our economic rights.We didn’t stand for it. We fought back by doing what we do best. We organized!We needed 100,000 signatures to put right to work on the ballot. We got 300,000!We visited 1,000 worksites. We knocked on 800,000 doors. We made a million calls. We mobilized our brothers and sisters. We talked to our neighbors, union and non-union alike.And on August 7, we sent that egregious law into the ash heap of history. It wasn’t even close!Democrats voted no. Half of Republicans voted no. Two out of every three Missourians who cast a ballot voted no.The Chamber of Commerce said that, for every punch they threw, working people threw ten more back. Even the Wall Street Journal warned CEOs that unions are on the attack.Hell yeah, we are!When corporations come after our families...when they try to undermine our jobs and bust up our unions...we show them what power really looks like.You know a thing or two about that here in Ohio. When you defeated SB 5, you sent the same clear message.By proving your organizing power, you’ve warded off right to work. Even as the other side has ruthlessly attacked our unions in nearby states, they’re too scared to push right to work in the Buckeye State!Because they know working Ohioans won’t sit idly by.The path to power runs through our movement. Across the country, working people have proven what we can do at the ballot box.We sent a bigoted judge into retirement in Alabama and a pro-union veteran to Congress in Pennsylvania. We sent an ally to the Governor’s Mansion in New Jersey and a wave of women to the state capitol in Virginia.On the night we defeated right to work in Missouri, you almost flipped John Kasich’s old House seat for the first time in three decades. This is a district that Donald Trump won by double digits. Kasich called it a message from the voters. You think?!Unions are on the march, brothers and sisters. And now, we’re marching straight to November.This year, we have unleashed the largest and most strategic member-to-member political program in our history. And Ohio, like always, is at the heart of it all.Across this state, we’re sparking change by doing what organizers do best...we’re talking to each other.We’re mobilizing our members...street-by-street...person-by-person...one conversation at a time. We’re talking about the things that matter most...our wages, our health care, our schools and infrastructure. We’re supporting candidates who will fight for us on those issues...who will listen to the voices of working people and not the whispers of a few CEOs.Brothers and sisters, we will move heaven and earth to help a genuine ally. We’ve proven that. But we won’t waste a dime or a door knock on fair weather friends. We aren’t going to show up for corporate politicians—no matter what party they’re in. We don’t need Republicans dead set on busting up our unions. And we don’t need Democrats who offer kind words in our union halls before running down the street to raise money at the Chamber of Commerce.We are setting the bar higher. Much higher. We are fighting for those who fight for us.Leaders who will help extend the rights and dignities of a union card to everyone...instead of trying to snatch it away.Leaders who understand that our right to collectively bargain is non-negotiable...no matter where you work.We’re going to fill the halls of power with union members and committed advocates for working people...public servants who believe that a truly strong economy advances the lives of working people...not just CEOs.To put it more simply, we need more people like Sherrod Brown.Sherrod’s not just a friend. He’s not just an ally. He’s a champion of our movement. He’s stood with us every day of his career, in good times and bad. He’s made it his life’s work to advance the lives of working people. And we are going to send him back to Washington come hell or high water.We need fighters like Sherrod Brown in the Senate!We need allies like Rich Cordray and Betty Sutton in the Governor’s Mansion!We need friends like Kathleen Clyde and Zack Space!We need to elect UNION MEMBERS like Rob Richardson!We have the power, brothers and sisters. Now, we have to keep using it!We’re spoiling for a fight. I say, bring it on! We've taken their best shot, and we're still standing.We’re gonna hit the streets, knock the doors, dial the phones and organize, organize, organize!We’re gonna reclaim America for the people who build it and make it work!We’re gonna reclaim the future for all of our kids—not just the children of privilege.We’re gonna flex our power like never before!We’re gonna show every robber baron and corporate hack that we aren’t going anywhere!This is our time. This is our moment. This is our election.We’re the American labor movement, and we will not...we will not...be denied!Brothers and sisters, I won’t sugar coat it. The road ahead won’t be easy.But it wasn’t easy when Samuel Gompers gavelled that first session of the AFL into order.It wasn’t easy when Mother Jones led a march of working people to the president’s door step.It wasn’t easy when Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta fought injustice in the grape fields.It wasn’t easy when we fought strikebreakers and company guards...when we faced threats and even death.Throughout the entire history of our movement, we’ve never had anything handed to us.Frederick Douglass once said, “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.”Brothers and sisters, we have fought for every victory. We bled to secure our right to stand together and bargain collectively. We marched and sacrificed to end child labor. We faced down the powers of Washington and Wall Street to win a minimum wage.In the face of seemingly insurmountable opposition, we steadily built a fairer economy and a more just society...because we had one advantage on our side: Solidarity.American greatness...American decency...the American Dream itself was built through solidarity...as workers joined arms and marched forward as one in common cause.Each time they insulted us...or fired us...or shot at us...we grew stronger.Bonded by a common struggle, working people kept fighting and discovered a fundamental truth that carries us to this day: You can’t stop all of us.We are an unassailable force when—and only when—we stand together.I remember back when my son Richard was young—maybe three or four years old. He and his buddy Chad were driving around in the backyard in one of those battery operated jeeps.He must have heard me talking on the phone, because he drove up and asked: “Dad, what’s a union?”So I told him to get out of the jeep and try to push it up the hill in our backyard. He strained and struggled, but he couldn’t get it up the hill. Then I told his friend Chad to give him a hand. Working together, they got the job done. I looked right at my son and said: “That’s a union...people doing things together that they can’t do alone.”Brothers and sisters, working people are climbing that hill. Every day. Against all odds.Together, we are fighting Wall Street to win a new trade regime that raises wages and standards for working people by enforcing fair rules no matter who is in office. That's how we stopped the TPP and put NAFTA back on the negotiating table. Keep up the pressure! It’s working!Together, we are fighting to save the Supreme Court from falling further into the hands of corporate apologists. And that starts with defeating Brett Kavanaugh.Together, we are fighting to create an economy that works for all of us. Raising wages. Quality, affordable health care. Safe jobs. Protection from discrimination. Retirement security. The freedom to form a union. That’s what’s at stake this November.Solidarity got us here. And solidarity is going to take us forward.Because here’s the thing: We won’t win as postal workers or steelworkers or teachers or miners. We won’t win as men or women, as black or white, as gay or straight.We will only win as a single movement of working people, from every region and every sector, fighting for the interests of all of our brothers and sisters...fighting for the rights and freedoms of all who live and work here.That’s our power! It doesn’t come from Washington or politicians or the courts.Our power lies in the 55 unions united through the AFL-CIO...in the nearly 13 million members who make up this union family.Our power lies in the workers who are standing together, marching together and fighting together.So stand up if you’re ready to march. Stand up if you’re ready to fight. Stand up if you’re ready to vote. Stand up if you’re ready to win.We make America great. We keep it safe. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We build the roads, fight the fires and lift the loads. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day. We tuck her into bed at night.And on November 6, we’re going to send a message to every politician and pundit who counted us out: We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united. And we’re just getting started. Thank you. God bless you all.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
211,Trumka: Fight Climate Change the Right Way ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-fight-climate-change-right-way,9-13-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Global Climate Action Summit: Good morning and thank you to Governor (Jerry) Brown for inviting me here to say a few words on behalf of the 12.5 million working women and men who belong to the 55 unions of the AFL-CIO.I am a coal miner by trade. That might seem unusual at a summit like this. But I learned something about science in the mine. When the boss told us to ignore the deadly hazards of the job...that sagging timber over our heads...that Black Lung cough...science told us the truth. And today, again, science tells us the truth: Climate change threatens our workers, our jobs and our economy.That’s why the labor movement supports bold, comprehensive action to fight climate change.That’s why we support continued progress on vehicle tailpipe standards, and why we passed a strong climate resolution at our last convention.That’s why we continue to support the Paris Agreement.Make no mistake, this is a tough issue for us. But, in the labor movement, we’re used to tough issues and hard choices. We’re prepared to do the right thing for our people and our planet. And we know that this fight can–and must–be about investing in a better, more inclusive, more just future...about creating good jobs and good lives for working families.  So I would ask each of you: does your plan for fighting climate change ask more from sick, retired coal miners than it does from you and your family? If it does, then you need to think again.  Climate strategies that leave coal miners’ pension funds bankrupt, power plant workers unemployed, construction workers making less than they do now...plans that devastate communities today, while offering vague promises about the future…they are more than unjust...they fundamentally undermine the power of the political coalition needed to address the climate crisis.Our enemies use these plans to divide us. They point to them to feed a politics of division and fear that threatens our entire democracy.I understand that many are frustrated with the pace of action on climate change. But simply demanding that plants, industries and projects be stopped or shut down, with no plan for the people who are put out of work...no call for shared sacrifice...and no dialogue or solidarity with those whose lives and communities are dependent on carbon-based fuels...that poisons the well politically and slows meaningful action on climate policy. It is not good enough to simply call for an end to carbon emissions—we have a responsibility to think thoughtfully and strategically about how to actually make that change.As a labor movement, we are ready to move faster. What does that require? People like you sitting down with people like me to figure out how we fund the investments in technology, workers and communities that can build a sustainable economy of broadly shared prosperity.California is showing us the way forward. Under Governor Brown’s leadership, unions, employers and government have come together to fight climate change and create good jobs by attaching labor standards to climate policies.In the San Joaquin Valley alone, right in California oil country, there have been over 4,000 megawatts worth of new clean energy projects in the past two decades. Fifteen million job-hours of union work, at union wages and with union benefits, made that possible.  And new paid sick leave and workers’ compensation laws, combined with strong collective bargaining agreements helped keep our members healthy and safe in the process. That’s what it looks like when we partner to fight against climate change and for good jobs.This is a remarkable time for collective action. Teachers from West Virginia to Arizona…workers in transportation, journalism, energy and more are coming together for a voice on the job. The popularity of unions recently hit a 15-year high. And we’re just getting started. We can bring this energy and momentum to the fight against climate change.Let’s join together. Let’s get the job done. And let’s do it the right way. Thank you very much.

212,Trumka at UC Berkeley: Collective Action and Shared Sacrifice Key to Fighting Climate Change,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-uc-berkeley-collective-action-and-shared-sacrifice-key-fighting-climate-change,9-12-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks on labor and climate at the UC Berkeley Labor Center: Good morning. I want to thank the Berkeley Labor Center for hosting this event, and for the incredible work you do each and every day. Thank you, Art (Pulaski), for that kind introduction and for all you do across California and nationally as a leader on the AFL-CIO’s state and local committee. I also want to recognize two very special union sisters: Sharan Burrow, General Secretary of the ITUC, who is a force for workers’ rights on the global stage and AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler, my trusted partner, who is pushing the labor movement to be bold and think big.We are here in the Bay Area this week to demonstrate the power of working people coming together to make lasting social and economic change. On Monday, Secretary-Treasurer Shuler laid out a strong vision for investing our resources wisely at the Committee on Workers’ Capital Conference. Tomorrow, we’ll head over to the Moscone Center where I’ll talk to 5,000 environmentalists about coal. Well, sort of. I look forward to pledging the labor movement’s 100 percent commitment to fighting climate change. But I will also make clear that the only path forward is by investing in a better, more inclusive, more just future for our families. You simply can’t do one without the other. Working people won’t allow the fight against climate change to become another excuse to continue the attacks on the working class.Something is happening in America, brothers and sisters. Collective action is on the rise. And now, even the White House is noticing. You may have heard that President Trump took a shot at me on Twitter...ON LABOR DAY! Let me tell you something: When Donald Trump is criticizing you on Twitter, you must be doing something right. Gallup just did a poll that found approval of unions at 62 percent...a 15-year high. Trump’s approval is below 40 percent, by the way.Working people from coast to coast are recognizing that the best way to achieve our dreams is by standing with the person next to us...finding strength in each other...fighting together.262,000 new members joined unions in 2017...and here’s the best part...three quarters of them were under the age of 35. We’re rallying the next generation to our cause, and our popularity is reaching new heights across the country. New research from MIT shows half of non-union workers would vote for a union today if given the chance. Working people want to stand together in a union. Working people want a voice on the job.If you want fresh proof of our momentum, look no further than Missouri. Last month, voters there went to the polls to decide the future of right to work. And with more than 67 percent of the vote, the Show Me State sent that horrible law into the ash heap of history. It wasn’t even close! Democrats voted no. Half of Republicans voted no. Two out of every three Missourians who cast a ballot voted no.After the Supreme Court ruled against us in Janus, many pundits wondered if it would be the death of the labor movement. Well, brothers and sisters, they got their answer! The Chamber of Commerce said that, for every punch they threw, working people threw ten more.We knocked more than 800,000 doors. We made more than 1 million calls. We spoke to members at over 1,000 different worksites...talking about good union jobs and the power of collective action. And it wasn’t just locals who were on the ground. Trade unionists from around the country went to Missouri to pitch in. The California Labor Federation, the LA County Fed, the Sacramento Central Labor Council and many, many others. And you know who was there in full force? IBEW 1245! Thank you, Tom Dalzell! Thank you, Local 1245! You showed America what solidarity looks like!Brothers and sisters, 2018 is the year of the worker. We are rising together as one to build a nation that honors our labor. We will not accept an economy that only works for a handful of elites. We will not back down or settle for less.We see a new spirit of progressive collective action all over America. Immigrant workers are putting aspiration above fear. Black Lives Matter. #MeToo. Young people demanding safe schools. The fight for LGBTQ equality. Civil disobedience to resist the horrible nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. More women, people of color, progressives AND UNION MEMBERS running for office and winning. And of course, the incredible, powerful teacher strikes, with big victories in states where collective bargaining for teachers is illegal and union-busting is a time-honored pastime.Each of these movements is a powerful rallying cry for change, driven by collective action. As a labor movement, it is our job to ignite the flames of justice, not contain them.And that’s exactly how we’ll be successful in the fight against climate change: by demanding justice for working people and ensuring no one is left behind.Most of you know that I started out as a coal miner. I grew up in Nemacolin, a small community in southwestern Pennsylvania. It was a company town...the mining company owned everything except the union hall and the church. They tried exercise total control over us...and they even tried to control reality...ignoring and muddying scientific facts to suit their own interests.It was expensive to reinforce  the mine tunnels, so the company simply disregarded the structural realities of digging miles underground.. It cost money to properly ventilate the mine, so they told us the air was fine, when it was actually filling with explosive gas. And worst of all, they claimed it was healthy to breathe coal dust, when we knew it was killing us, and our families.But of course, the real laws of science always prevail—tunnels without supports cave in, Mines filled with methane explode. Miners’ lungs filled with coal dust have no room for oxygen. And an  atmosphere pumped full of carbon will heat the planet to a point that imperils human civilization.As we speak, a huge hurricane is headed toward the East Coast, its power fed by Atlantic waters that are warmer than average, and its impact sure to be exacerbated by sea and ground levels rising under higher than average rain. Averages, of course, are constantly changing as we set new climate records, and not in a good way.For this reason and many more, I am here on behalf of the American labor movement to make absolutely clear that we remain committed to the task of stopping runaway climate change. I say “we remain” because as the fight against climate change has taken on increased urgency, the labor movement in the United States and globally has supported urgent action. We supported the last real comprehensive climate bill, Waxman-Markey. We supported the Paris Accord, and we opposed President Trump’s destructive decision to withdraw from it.And, for the first time ever, at our national convention last October, the AFL-CIO passed a climate resolution...adopted unanimously...with the outspoken support of the unions whose members work in the energy sector. That part is critical–the workers most impacted by a move away from carbon fuels came together and endorsed a plan to save our people and our planet.Our resolution strongly asserts that the fastest and most equitable way to address climate change is for labor to be at the center of creating solutions that reduce emissions while investing in our communities, maintaining and creating high-wage union jobs and reducing poverty.We know it can be done. It’s happening right now. From California to New York, the labor movement is putting our political weight behind efforts to fight climate change while winning strong labor standards in the process. This isn’t only good policy. It’s good politics. It’s proving that big, transformational change happens faster when labor is at the table.Make no mistake, this is not easy for us. For millions of workers in the United States...our livelihoods...our families...our communities....are at stake—not decades from now, but right now. We are prepared to make the tough choices. We are willing to sacrifice. But we will not bear the costs of climate policy alone. The most privileged in our society must also do their fair share.You see, the main challenge in fighting climate change is not technological or scientific. It’s economic and political. We have the technology to take on climate change, and every day that technology improves. Save for a handful of climate deniers, we know that human beings are causing climate change with catastrophic results.So the most important question we face today is how to create a sustainable, low-carbon global economy of broadly shared prosperity. How do we embrace a vision that changes the politics of climate change? What can we do, together, to overcome the cynicism and rising authoritarianism across the globe, that keeps us from moving forward faster to fight climate change even as our own behavior threatens the very fabric of civilization?Successful action will require more than an understanding of climate science. We must think carefully about how to actually make change. And to be successful, it has to begin with dialogue and negotiation with those whose lives and communities, health care and pensions are bound up with carbon-based fuels.We must push for an approach that attacks poverty and inequality, one that gives people hope and confronts the rising divisions polluting our political system. We will fail unless we can make change work for working people. This cannot be an afterthought or a nice thing we think about only after we deprive whole communities and regions of their economic lifeline.  To be clear, the solution is never going to be perfect. Every source of energy, every technology, both creates jobs and has environmental consequences—solar, wind, hydro, you name it. But only carbon emissions threaten to destabilize the ecosystems we depend on, and with them, civilization itself. That means if we are going to fight climate change effectively we must be open to all methods of reducing carbon emissions—including technologies some environmentalists don’t like.We can only solve the challenge of climate change when we find a formula based on clean energy that also meets the real needs of regular people in their everyday lives...decent work and pay...access to energy and water...health care... food security...the list goes on. The alternative is the continued politics of stalemate, inaction or worse.There are voices around the world seeking to use the fear of change to turn working people toward hatred and division in the service of authoritarian politics. When the movement to fight climate change ignores the issue of economic justice, or treats it as an afterthought, when we seek to address climate change without respecting the hard work and sacrifice of workers in the energy and manufacturing sectors whose jobs are threatened—we feed the forces who are trying to tear us apart.  The stakes are enormous. If we don’t get this right, we could find that our democracy fails before our climate...as rising fear and rising hate converge on us faster than rising seas.The labor movement, here in the United States and globally, is blazing a different path. We are ready to be part of this fight. We can use this historic moment of collective action to defend our democracies and our planet, and build a prosperous future for all those who call it home.So let’s get to it. Thank you very much.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
213,Trumka Calls for New Supreme Court Direction at Yale Law School ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-calls-new-supreme-court-direction-yale-law-school,9-7-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at Yale Law School on the future of the Supreme Court: Good afternoon. It’s great to be back here at Yale. I want to thank the American Constitution Society for your hospitality. I look forward to taking your questions.“Which side are you on? Which side are you on?” Those are lyrics from a song about a bitter struggle between my union, the United Mine Workers of America, and mine owners in southeastern Kentucky. The song continues, “They say in Harlan County there are no neutrals there. You'll either be a union man or a thug for J.H. Blair.”Unfortunately, today those lyrics could serve as the fight song for the Supreme Court’s pro-corporate, activist wing of justices who wax poetic about precedent and judicial restraint, yet regularly bend over backwards to serve the interests of the wealthy, the powerful and the privileged. There are no neutrals there.I was raised in small sliver of southwestern Pennsylvania called Nemacolin. It was a company town. The coal barons owned everything except the church and the union hall. They even printed and paid in money that could only be used at coal-owned businesses. It was called scrip.One night when I was little, I was complaining to my grandfather about the way the coal company was treating miners like him. He asked what I planned to do about it. “When I grow up, I could be a politician.” Well, that got me a playful smack on the head. Wrong answer. So then I said: “How about a lawyer so I can stand up for workers?” Bingo. That’s what he wanted to hear. Then my grandfather said something that has always stuck with me: “If you want to help workers, you first need to help people.” It was a message about fairness, dignity and justice for all, one the Supreme Court could use a reminder of today.When it was time to go to work, I followed my father and grandfather into the mines. That’s what Trumka men did.  But I also went to law school at Villanova. I often studied underground using the light from my helmet. From the moment I cracked open a law book, I revered the Supreme Court. It was the temple of justice...the ultimate source of recourse for those without money or political access...people like my grandfather. I revered the Court throughout my time as a lawyer for the Mine Workers. For the majority of my adult life, I put the Supreme Court on a pedestal as the one institution left uncorrupted by the forces of greed and division. And I did so even when the Court made decisions I personally disagreed with, confident that facts and the law were determining outcomes rather than rank ideology. Unfortunately, that reverence is now gone.Starting with Bush v. Gore in 2000 and continuing through Janus v. AFSCME Council 31 earlier this summer, the Court has used its authority to entrench economic and political power in the hands of the elites against a growing number of Americans, and increasingly to foster division on racial, religious and ethnic lines. It is impossible to read the Court’s decisions in major cases over the past two decades without coming to the conclusion that they amount to deck stacking...an effort by the Court in tandem with reactionary political forces to ensure that justice is available only to the wealthy and well-connected.Sometimes the extra-legal nature of this effort is hard to see. The process at the Supreme Court looks to be fair and free. The opinions are loaded with footnotes and mainstream judicial language. But on closer examination, like a forged work of art, something is wrong. In Bush v. Gore, the statement IN THE OPINION ITSELF that it has NO precedential value tells you all you need to know. In the Court’s decision upholding the president’s Muslim ban, Trump v. Hawaii, the absurd assertion that the policy isn’t motivated by religion is clearly an act of politics, not jurisprudence. And then there is the Janus decision, which I will discuss in detail momentarily.This blatant judicial overreach threatens our democratic system of government, the integrity of the Court itself and all those who rely on the third branch of government to be free and fair. Without a serious course correction, America is in danger of becoming a company nation.And let me be clear...this is a systemic problem throughout the federal judiciary. Federal judges at the district and appeals court levels often have the final say in NLRB and OSHA cases. While the Supreme Court decides approximately 80 cases each year, the circuit courts decide some 55,000. So we are absolutely concerned that the Senate is confirming lower court ideologues at an alarming rate, many with no litigation experience and open hostility to civil and workers’ rights.But ultimately it is the Supreme Court that is responsible for the integrity of our legal system. And there is simply no denying this is the most corporate-friendly, anti-worker court in modern history. And don’t take my word for it. Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit and the University of Chicago, father of law and economics, and no friend of labor, along with two distinguished academic co-authors, studied all the Court’s decisions from 1947 to 2011 and found that Justice Alito and Chief Justice Roberts are the most pro-business justices to serve during that 64-year period. Justice Thomas is number five. For the 2017-2018 court term, corporations had a stunning 90 percent victory rate. And Brett Kavanaugh would drive that number even higher.I am a realist. Of course I expect that justices are human and have certain predispositions that affect their decisions. But I also expect judges not to serve as advocates for one side. Now even that line has been crossed by Justice Alito. Understanding Justice Alito’s role as ADVOCATE in Janus is critical to understanding what has gone wrong in the 21st century court.During his confirmation hearing, Chief Justice Roberts famously pledged, “I will remember that it’s my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.” But when it comes to the law governing public sector unions, his colleague Justice Alito has sought to do all of the above.It began in 2012 in a little-known case called Knox v. Service Employees International Union, Local 1000, which involved the application of well-settled law permitting unions, required to represent members and nonmembers alike, to spread the cost of representation across the entire group. To be clear, this was not and has never been about politics. An employee has been able to opt out of union political spending for decades. This is about paying for a piece of the collective bargaining and other representation work the union is required to provide. The argument is simple: if you get the benefits, you should bear some of the costs.A little more than 40 years ago, the Court upheld the constitutionality of fair share fees in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education. All nine members of the Court either joined or concurred in Justice Potter Stewart’s opinion. Seven of those justices, including Stewart, were appointed by Republican presidents.In 1991, Justice Scalia...Antonin Scalia...explained: “Where the state imposes upon the union a duty to deliver services, it may permit the union to demand reimbursement for them.” Until Knox, that principle was not questioned.Rather, as Justice Kagan recently observed, “over nearly four decades, we have cited Abood favorably numerous times and we have repeatedly affirmed and applied its core distinction between the costs of collective bargaining...and those of political activities.”No party in Knox, not even the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, which has been a relentless critic of public sector unions for half a century, questioned Abood. But Justice Alito did. His opinion, while narrowly deciding the question of whether the union had adequately informed nonmembers about its spending, labeled the four-decade-old precedent “unusual” and even “extraordinary.” As Justice Sotomayor explained, Justice Alito’s opinion was “well outside the scope of the questions presented and brief[ed]” in the case and “breaks [the Court’s] own rules and, more importantly, disregards principles of judicial restraint.”  Justice Alito continued to chip away at Abood in 2014, citing his own opinion in Knox no fewer than 16 times. In another case involving SEIU, Harris v. Quinn, a 5-4 majority reversed a unanimous decision by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, authored by a Reagan appointee, which held that a union representing state-paid employees who care for disabled people in their homes can spread the cost of that representation across all employees because they are jointly employed by the state and the patients they care for. Prior to Knox, the Harris plaintiffs, represented by the same anti-worker organization, did not question Abood. But with the door opened by Justice Alito, when the case reached the Supreme Court, they asked for it to be overturned. Justice Alito used the opportunity to pile on, casting doubt on Abood’s soundness and in the words of Justice Kagan’s dissent, “taking potshots” at the longstanding precedent while only holding that it did not apply to what he called “partial public employees.”Justice Alito’s plan finally came to fruition in June when he decided Janus and, picking up his own trail of breadcrumbs, reversed Abood. Justice Kagan bluntly described Justice Alito’s scheme: “Dicta in those recent decisions indeed began the assault on Abood that has culminated today. Relying on them is bootstrapping—and mocking stare decisis. Don’t like a decision? Just throw some gratuitous criticisms into a couple of opinions and a few years later point to them as ‘special justifications’ for departing from stare decisis.”Let me put this plainly. Justice Alito acted as both advocate and judge in reversing Abood. There was no neutral there. It’s the type of judicial activism conservatives have long claimed to deplore.Janus is important not only because of the perversion of process that brought it before the Court, but also for the dangerous principle it articulates. In the apt words of Justice Kagan, the conservative majority has “weaponized the First Amendment.”This Court doesn’t see the First Amendment as manifesting the rights of working people or protestors or regular Americans, as our founders intended. Instead, they’ve used it almost exclusively to strengthen the hand of corporations.Of course, Citizens United, the decision allowing corporations to spend unlimited money on electoral campaigns, comes to mind. But, it hasn’t stopped there.Professor John Coates at...forgive me...Harvard Law School...wrote a fascinating piece that examines parties bringing First Amendment cases before the Supreme Court.  Coates found that, until the 1950s, virtually no businesses brought First Amendment cases before the Court...with the exception of newspapers. From the 1950s to the 1970s, 20 percent of First Amendment cases were brought by corporations. That jumped to 40 percent after the 1970s.Corporations’ win rates also spiked dramatically from 20 percent before 1970 to 90 percent today...90%. Coates concludes that “corporations have increasingly displaced individuals as direct beneficiaries of First Amendment rights.”Does any reasonable person believe the Bill of Rights was adopted to benefit corporations? Is that the legal framework our founders had in mind? Is it what you envisioned when you decided to study law?Tim Wu at Columbia Law School wrote this: “Once the patron saint of protesters and the disenfranchised, the First Amendment has become the darling of economic libertarians and corporate lawyers who have recognized its power to immunize private enterprise from legal restraint.”Justice Breyer warned about the deregulatory use of the First Amendment by the conservative majority in his 2011 dissent of a decision striking down a Vermont law preventing drug companies from buying prescription histories to target consumers. The Court held the law violated the First Amendment because it discriminated against Big Pharma based on the contents of its speech. Breyer said the decision “threatens to return us to a happily bygone era when judges scrutinized legislation for its interference with economic liberty.”For generations, the Court made clear through the commercial speech doctrine that economic regulation in the public interest was entirely constitutional. But in this activist era, the Court has perverted the First Amendment to justify an economic power grab...mirroring similar misuse of the 14th Amendment in the Lochner era, where the Court in 1905 struck down a New York law protecting bakery workers from unreasonable hours by citing the amendment’s Due Process clause.And that brings us back to Janus. At the end of her powerful dissent, Justice Kagan issued an even darker warning about her colleagues’ perversion of the First Amendment: “The majority has chosen the winners by turning the First Amendment into a sword,” she said. “Speech is everywhere—a part of every human activity. For that reason, almost all economic and regulatory policy affects or touches speech. So the majority’s road runs long. And at every stop are black-robed rulers overriding citizens’ choices. The First Amendment was meant for better things. It was meant not to undermine but to protect democratic governance—including over the role of public-sector unions.”The long road Justice Kagan referenced should concern each and every one of us. Janus is part of an effort by the Court to fundamentally alter the foundation of our democracy so it serves a single purpose...concentrating power and wealth in the hands of a select few. This is not just a moral wrong. It’s a very real, destabilizing threat to our way of life. A 2016 Harvard study...again my apologies...found that only 30 percent of millenials believe it’s essential to live in a democratic nation. 24 percent say democracy is bad. Your generation has experienced our economic and justice system up close and quite frankly, many of you are not impressed. So the radical swing of the Supreme Court is not just an affront to the working people I represent...it poses to a clear and present danger to the broad democratic ideals that have defined America for generations.And it’s not just Janus. At the end of last term, in less than one month, the court eroded key rights at the center of a thriving and sustainable democracy. In Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, the five justices who decided Janus held that employees can be required by companies to submit all workplace grievances to historically pro-employer private arbitrators and waive their rights both to go to court and join together in class action lawsuits. In Husted v. APRI, that same narrow majority upheld Ohio’s practice of purging voters from the registration rolls if they miss a single federal election. And I already mentioned Trump v. Hawaii. In one fell swoop, the Court made it harder to get justice on the job, undermined the right to vote and made it easier to discriminate on the basis of faith.In this context, the threat to the rights of working people posed by the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh cannot be overstated. His confirmation would potentially lock-in the pro-corporate tilt of the Court for a generation. Despite the assurances he has given the Senate Judiciary Committee this week, Judge Kavanaugh is anything but a neutral. He has been a devoted champion of corporate interests throughout his career.  Let me give you just two examples.First, in a case involving a union election at a meat processing plant in Brooklyn, New York, Judge Kavanaugh went a step beyond even the Supreme Court’s draconian ruling that undocumented workers fired for organizing cannot collect back pay. He asserted that undocumented workers are not even employees at all. Kavanaugh would have simply erased 12 million working people from U.S. labor law.  Second, Judge Kavanaugh has proven his disdain for basic health and safety protections in the workplace.His opinions drip with contempt for OSHA and other agencies...substituting his own ideology for their expertise. That’s not deference...it’s defiance.I mentioned earlier that I come from a coal family. My father, both of my grandfathers, my uncles and even some of my cousins all died of Black Lung. As we speak, 150 workers are dying each day of workplace injuries and illnesses—and that number is rising. So I take it personally that in a case challenging an OSHA finding that Sea World violated workplace safety law, leading to the death of a trainer during a performance, Kavanaugh essentially argued that the worker knew what they were getting into. He wrote: “When should we as a society paternalistically decide that the participants in these sports and entertainment activities must be protected from themselves – that the risk of significant physical injury is simply too great even for eager and willing participants.”Sound familiar? The same justification was used to deny justice to miners who “willingly” went underground to support our families despite known dangers. The graveyards of western Pennsylvania are filled with the bodies of men whose families were desperate for the “paternalism’ Judge Kavanaugh blithely writes about.  But for the “paternalism” of MSHA and the NLRB, I doubt I would even be standing before you today I cannot properly express to you the depth of my anger when I read those words of Judge Kavanaugh. I see the faces of my family, my friends, my brothers and sisters whose lives were saved by that “paternalism.”Judge Kavanaugh would return workplace law to the 19th century. He would ignore the statutory will of Congress and the expertise of regulating agencies. He would deny working people our most fundamental rights. And that’s exactly why he was nominated. He’s been vetted and rubber stamped by the very same people who’ve been pulling the strings since Bush v. Gore, seeking to frustrate American democracy and guarantee that money and privilege rule this country for the rest of my life and yours. That’s why I am proud to be among those who have pledged to fight and defeat his nomination.But the larger question is, how do people like you and institutions like this respond to a Court gone awry? Alexis de Tocqueville said almost two hundred years ago that lawyers were America’s bulwark against tyranny. How should the legal profession respond to an anti-democratic impulse at its highest levels? That will be your task when you leave this campus. Let me suggest that we need to begin by recognizing that decisions like Bush v. Gore, Citizens United, Trump v. Hawaii and Janus v. AFSCME should be given more than casual scrutiny by lawyers, law professors and judges. It is time to look at these rulings as a body...with historic implications beyond the scope of each individual case. And perhaps given their origins in an effort to frustrate the normal workings of our democracy and our laws, we need to consider whether in the future they should be accorded a special status in American judicial infamy, taking their place with other monuments to fear and division like Dred Scott and Korematsu.I want to revere the Supreme Court again. But to regain the trust and reverence of the American people and save our democracy in the process, the president must appoint and Congress must confirm only justices capable of being neutral. Brett Kavanaugh fails this test. He would drive the Court even further into the pocket of corporations. And that’s why we oppose his nomination.Thank you very much.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

214,Trumka: Worker Bargaining Power Key to Future of Work ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-worker-bargaining-power-key-future-work,9-5-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a press conference unveiling ""The Future of Work, Wages, and Labor,"" a report by four members of Congress from diverse districts across the country focused on building power and prosperity for working people. Good morning.I want to start by thanking Representatives (Mark) DeSaulnier, (Mark) Pocan, (Donald) Norcross and (Debbie) Dingell for their outstanding work. And as always, I want to recognize the tremendous leadership of Ranking Member Bobby Scott.This thoughtful and detailed report provides an important foundation for building an economy centered on good jobs, rising wages and strong worker bargaining power.You’ve put a lot of bold ideas forward here...some that we strongly support and others that deserve serious discussion. Your willingness to think outside the box as we look for ways to tackle inequality is the right approach at the right time.At the AFL-CIO, we are nearly a year into our own comprehensive process focused on shaping the future of work so it works for working people.Over the weekend, Sarita Gupta, Stephen Lerner and Joseph McCartin published a piece in the American Prospect entitled “It’s Not the 'Future of Work,' It’s the Future of Workers That’s in Doubt.” I encourage you to read it. They make the important point that the concentration of wealth and power represents the greatest threat to our future, not computerization or artificial intelligence.With that in mind, I believe the future of work debate comes down to two fundamental questions.What happens to a system that fails to provide a sustainable standard of living for its people?Who shares in the benefits of technological innovation?If technology is used to further concentrate economic power in the hands of the wealthy few, I’m not sure our system of government...our way of life...can ultimately survive.But if we make political and moral choices to ensure technology is a tool for broadly shared prosperity, we can foster a new era of economic equality and opportunity.Working people have made it perfectly clear which direction we prefer. Collective action is on the rise in America. 262,000 new members joined unions in 2017...and here’s the best part...three quarters of them were under the age of 35. New research from MIT shows half of non-union workers would vote for a union today if given the chance. And Gallup released a poll last week showing the popularity of unions at 62 percent...a 15-year high.And that brings us to the second question: how do we ensure the benefits of technology are shared broadly by all of society?First, let me make something perfectly clear: we embrace innovation.Auto workers are designing and building nextgen automobiles that will save countless lives on the road. Electrical workers are using virtual reality to train a new wave of apprentices, handing them tools that I couldn't have dreamed of when I first stepped foot in a union hall. Steelworkers are advocating for exoskeleton technology—to help workers avoid injuries on the job. We aren't just embracing the future of work. We're living it and pioneering it every single day.But we will not allow 21st century technology to be used as an excuse for 19th century labor practices.This moment of historic collective action calls for a different approach, one where technology leads to better pay and working conditions for everyone and even greater prosperity for us to share in.And that requires having a real voice in our economy and at the bargaining table.The labor movement is committed to doing everything in our power to keep winning that voice in 2018 and beyond.Thank you again for this report.

215,Trumka to Arizona AFL-CIO Labor Day Breakfast: Vote Union,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-arizona-afl-cio-labor-day-breakfast-vote-union,8-31-2018,"Thank you, Brother Jim (McLaughlin) for that introduction and for your leadership. UFCW Local 99 is an absolute powerhouse in this state and you, Dean (Wine), Bob (Bean) and Fred (Yamashita) are doing an incredible job leading the Arizona labor movement forward.I want to start this morning by remembering Arizona’s senior senator, John McCain. McCain served our nation with honor, enduring great suffering in the process. As a labor movement, we often disagreed with McCain on policy, but no one can question his devotion to our country. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and the people of Arizona during this difficult time. Thank you.Happy Labor Day, brothers and sisters! I’ll be honest...I didn’t come to Phoenix on the last day of August for the weather. I’m here for the activism. I’m here because we have a chance to change the direction of Arizona and our entire nation.Working people are on the rise, brothers and sisters. And if you want proof of our momentum, look at what happened in Missouri. Earlier this month, voters there went to the polls to decide the future of right to work. And with more than 67 percent of the vote, the Show Me State sent that horrible law into the ash heap of history.We knocked more than 800,000 doors. We made more than 1 million phone calls. We spoke to members at over 1,000 different worksites...talking about good union jobs and the power of collective action.

Democrats voted no. Half of Republicans voted no. Two out of every three Missourians who cast a ballot voted no. The Chamber of Commerce said that, for every punch they threw, working people threw ten more. Even the Wall Street Journal editorial board is now warning CEOs that unions are on the attack.262,000 new members joined unions in 2017...and here’s the best part...three quarters of them were under the age of 35. We’re rallying the next generation to our cause, and our popularity is reaching new heights across the country. New research from MIT shows half of non-union workers would vote for a union today if given the chance. They want to join us. They want a voice on the job.

Is it any wonder why? We transform lives, brothers and sisters! Economists at Princeton just confirmed what we’ve known all along...unions raise wages up to 20 percent...decade after decade. And that’s not all. We negotiate top-notch benefits. We make work safe, retirement secure and build the economic future that our kids and grandkids deserve! Unions have always been at the core of this country’s fundamental promise, and I’ll be damned if we’re going to stop now!Brothers and sisters, 2018 is the year of the worker. We are rising together as one to build a nation that honors our labor. We will not accept an economy that only works for a handful of elites. We will not back down or settle for less.Immigrant workers are putting aspiration above fear. Black lives matter. #MeToo. Young people are demanding safe schools. The fight for LGBTQ equality...you just hosted the Pride at Work convention here last week.Each of these movements is a powerful rallying cry for change, driven by collective action. And as a labor movement, it is our job to ignite the flames of justice, not contain them.You know a thing or two about that here in Arizona. Teachers in this state did something remarkable.They didn't just seize the country's attention. They captured our imagination. In every corner of America, working people watched on TV and saw a sea of red marching through the streets of Phoenix...70,000 of our brothers and sisters demanding better than the crumbs that fall off the end of the table. And the AFL-CIO was right by their side...as affiliate unions set up a solidarity row to hand out water, distribute swag and provide support.When working people saw those teachers march...unafraid...they thought...I deserve better too. I need to speak out! I need to organize! Arizona teachers helped inspire a wave of collective action that is sweeping this country.Working people from coast to coast are recognizing that the best way to achieve our dreams is by standing with the person next to us...finding strength in each other...fighting together.After the Supreme Court ruled against us in Janus, many pundits wondered if it would be the death of the labor movement. Well, brothers and sisters, they got their answer!Our enemies want a fight? I say, bring it on! We’re the true American patriots. We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united. We’re rising in solidarity…real solidarity…where your picket line is my picket line, and my picket line is your picket line.This is our country...and it’s time...high time...we took it back!Make no mistake, we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us here in Arizona. I know you just had your primary. 2018 is a make or break election. Kyrsten (Pronounced Ker-sten) Sinema is a friend and ally. When former Governor Jan Brewer introduced legislation to make collective bargaining illegal for government workers, teachers, police and firefighters, Sinema led the fight to stop it. As a Congresswoman, she has been a champion for higher wages, better health care and safer workplaces. Brothers and sisters, let’s send Kyrsten Sinema to the Senate...and Mitch McConnell into the minority.But, the labor movement’s fight isn’t just about the halls of Congress. We’re pushing just as hard at the state and local level. We said no to “show me your papers” and a license to discriminate. We rallied together to defeat Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Sheriff Joe should be in prison, not public office.Brothers and sisters, the wind is at our backs. We can win the three seats we need to put the State Senate back in labor-friendly hands. And we can end the era of corruption, division and corporate greed in Phoenix by firing a CEO and electing a teacher. Brothers and sisters, let’s make David Garcia the next governor of Arizona.This is our time. We are mobilizing the biggest member-to-member political program in our history. We’re tearing down a system that listens to the whispers of CEOs and ignores the voices of working people. We’re filling the halls of power with union members and our allies.We can reclaim our country...from our city halls and our state houses to the U.S. House and Senate. We can do it because each of you are ready to stake a claim in building a better future.Each of you in this room—you are our greatest weapon. We need your passion. When you talk to your coworkers...when you talk to your friends and family...when you make the decision to fully participate in your union...that’s how progress is won!The march to Election Day starts now. And my message is simple: vote union.For higher wages and quality, affordable health care...vote union!To protect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security...vote union!For the freedom to organize and bargain collectively...vote union!For trade that actually lifts workers up...vote union!For better roads, better schools and better jobs....vote union!For an immigration system that respects our border agents, keeps families together and welcomes those seeking a better life...vote union!For Arizona...for America...for each other.VOTE UNION! VOTE UNION! VOTE UNION!Brothers and sisters, when I think about the attacks against us...from corporations...from the Supreme Court...from right-wing legislators...I get angry. And sometimes, I even get discouraged.But on the darkest of days, I remember something my grandmother used to tell me. Stana tupe benne. In Italian, it means: from everything comes some good.Now you might be wondering….what good can come from right to work and Janus and the proposals to gut our financial, health care and retirement security? What good can come from a Supreme Court that rules with corporations 90 percent of the time and a nominee in Brett Kavanaugh who would push that number even higher?What good can come from a president who has used his office to actively hurt working people... appointing the deciding vote in Janus and cheering that awful decision on Twitter?The answer is this. The vicious attacks on our unions have brought us closer together.Our bond is stronger. Our memory is longer.And that unity paid off last week when a federal judge struck down President Trump’s union-busting executive orders attacking our federal employees. AFGE sent the entire country a message: working people will not be pushed around.Remember, throughout the entire history of our movement, we’ve never had anything handed to us.Frederick Douglass once said, “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.”That’s the story of our movement.Brothers and sisters, we have fought for every victory. We bled to secure our right to stand together and bargain collectively. We marched and sacrificed to end child labor. We faced down the powers of Washington and Wall Street to win a minimum wage.Every speck of progress was clawed from the hands of those who said we were asking too much...who tried to destroy us with one hand and dismissed us as radicals with the other. They considered us a conspiracy in restraint of trade. They said dignity...fairness...a safe job...were too much to ask.In the face of seemingly insurmountable opposition, we steadily built a fairer economy and a more just society...because we had one advantage on our side: Solidarity.American greatness...American decency...the American Dream itself was built through solidarity...as workers joined arms and marched forward as one in common cause.Each time they fired us...or shot at us...or told us sit down and shut up...we grew stronger.Bonded by a common struggle, working people kept fighting and discovered a fundamental truth that carries us to this day: You can’t stop ALL of us.We are an unassailable force when—and only when—we stand together.I remember back when my son Richard was young—maybe three or four years old. He and his buddy Chad were driving around in the backyard in one of those battery operated jeeps.He must have heard me talking on the phone, because he drove up and asked: “Dad, what’s a union?”So I told him to get out of the jeep and try to push it up the hill in our backyard. He strained and struggled, but he couldn’t get it up the hill. Then I told his friend Chad to give him a hand. Working together, they got the job done. I looked right at my son and said: “That’s a union...people doing things together that they can’t do alone.”Brothers and sisters, working people are climbing that hill. Every day. Against all odds.And we’re not going to stop until we reach the promised land.Because we’re the ones who wake our nation up every single morning. We tuck her into bed at night. We build the ships and mine the coal. We lift the loads. We pour the molds. We connect our cities and the world. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We make this country strong.We don’t duck and run. We don’t run and hide. We’re the American labor movement, and we will not...we will not...be denied!Thank you! God bless you! Happy Labor Day!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
216,Trumka to Postal Workers Convention: We’re Not Even Close to Done,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-postal-workers-convention-were-not-even-close-done,8-20-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the American Postal Workers Union 24th Biennial National Convention:Good morning, APWU! It’s great to be home in Pennsylvania!Brother Mark (Dimondstein), thank you for that introduction and for all that you do for working people. You’re fighting the good fight alongside everyone in this room, and it’s my honor to call you a brother.Brothers and sisters, I want to start by extending my deepest sympathies to each of you. Know that the AFL-CIO and the entire labor movement join you in mourning the loss of your president emeritus and our friend, William Burrus.We miss him dearly, but Brother Bill has left behind something so much greater. His barrier-smashing legacy is embedded into the fabric of the APWU and our movement for working people.He was a tireless advocate for his fellow postal workers...an unwavering fighter in the struggle for social and economic justice.Brothers and sisters, he refused to accept the inequities he saw in the world. He put his foot down and fought for something better!It’s time to follow in his footsteps. It’s time to fight like hell...to end the injustice plaguing us...to end the indignity we face...to end the inequality paralyzing our country...to end the egregious idea that exploitation is the cost of doing business.Brothers and sisters, we have some big fights ahead of us. And when I think of the doors we need to knock...the people we need to reach...and the communities we need to engage, there is nothing I’d rather have behind me than an army of postal workers!Bringing people together...it’s what you do. It’s what you’ve always done. It’s in your blood. From New York City to the most remote outposts of Alaska...for nearly two and a half centuries, your work has enabled that fundamental American idea...E pluribus unum...out of many, one.You are the best of our movement! You embody public service. You are government at its best—diligently serving the needs of all those who live and work here.So, when I hear right-wingers talk about breaking up the Post Office and selling it off to the highest bidder, I start to wonder...what don’t they want to privatize? What don’t they want to put in the hands of corporations?That broken corporate ideology is alive and well in the White House...and it’s been coupled by the Trump administration's failure to meet even basic responsibilities...the bread and butter services that a government is supposed to provide.Just think about this. The Postal Service’s board of governors has nine members. Anyone know how many vacancies there are?Nine!Without a Board of Governors, the Postal Service is functioning under what's called ""temporary emergency status."" You can't plan. You can't make decisions. You can't make the investments you need. You can't address any of the challenges you’re facing.

That's no way to run a government. And boy, ""temporary emergency"" is a pretty fitting term for how this administration does its business.Now, the same corporate right-wing that can’t do its job wants to come after your jobs! They want to reduce mail delivery. They’ve want to destroy your pensions. They want to cut your benefits, slash your pay and destroy your union!Brothers and sisters, WE SAY NO!We’re gonna beat back these attacks!We’re gonna defend the Postal Service!We’re gonna defend our unions!We’re gonna defend our communities, our country and the working people who serve them!And if these corporate hacks want to get to any of the hard-working postal workers in this room, they’ve got 13 million of us to get through first...starting with me!Something is happening in America, brothers and sisters. Workers are writing a comeback story unlike any I’ve seen in my 50 years in the labor movement.262,000 new members joined unions in 2017...and here’s the best part...three quarters of them were under the age of 35. We’re rallying the next generation to our cause, and our popularity is reaching new heights across the country.  Half of non-union workers would vote to join a union today if given the chance. They want to join us. They want a voice on the job.Is it any wonder why? We transform lives, brothers and sisters! We raise wages...a 10 to 20 percent boost for eight straight decades, according to economists at Princeton. We negotiate top-notch benefits. We make work safe, retirement secure and build the economic future that our kids and grandkids deserve! Unions have always been at the core of this country’s fundamental promise, and I’ll be damned if we’re going to stop now!Brothers and sisters, we’re not even close to done. 2018 is the year of the worker.Imagine what we could accomplish with leaders who actually fought for working people instead of trying to crush our unions and silence our collective voice.Well, I have a message for every politician, Republican or Democrat, who wants to delay or derail our progress: Get on board or get the hell out of our way!We’ve proven what we can do on the campaign trail.We’ve elected pro-worker allies in Alabama and Virginia and Pennsylvania and New Jersey.And if you want more proof of our momentum, look no further than Missouri.Last Tuesday, voters there went to the polls to decide the future of right to work.And by 2-1, the Show Me State sent that horrible law into the ash heap of history.It wasn’t even close!We needed 100,000 signatures to put right to work on the ballot. We got more than 300,000.

We knocked more than 800,000 doors. We dialed more than 1 million phones. We made our case at 1,000 different worksites...talking about good union jobs and the power of collective action.

We did what we do best. And, it worked!Democrats voted no. Half of Republicans voted no. Two out of every three Missourians who cast a ballot voted no.The Chamber of Commerce said that, for every punch they threw, working people threw ten more. Even the Wall Street Journal editorial board is now warning CEOs that unions are on the attack.The labor movement made it crystal clear that WE WILL NOT cede an inch after Janus.Brothers and sisters, November could not get here soon enough.We have the power. Now, we have to keep using it!We can’t slow down! We can’t stop! We have to keep going!We’re gonna hit the streets, knock the doors, dial the phones and organize, organize, organize!Let’s reclaim America for the people who build it and make it work!Let’s reclaim the future for all of our kids—not just the children of privilege.Let’s flex our power like never before!Let’s show every robber baron and corporate hack that we aren’t going anywhere!We’re spoiling for a fight. I say, bring it on! We've taken their best shot, and we're still standing. We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united.This is our country...and it’s time...high time...we took it back.Brothers and sisters, the road ahead won’t be easy. But here’s the truth: throughout the entire history of our movement, we’ve never had anything handed to us.Frederick Douglass once said, “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.”A fitting summary of the labor movement.Brothers and sisters, we have fought for every victory. We bled to secure our right to stand together and bargain collectively. We marched and sacrificed to end child labor. We faced down the powers of Washington and Wall Street to win a minimum wage.In the face of seemingly insurmountable opposition, we steadily built a fairer economy and a more just society...because we had one advantage on our side: Solidarity.American greatness...American decency...the American Dream itself was built through solidarity...as workers joined arms and marched forward as one in common cause.Each time they fired us...or shot at us...or violated our dignity...we grew stronger.Bonded by a common struggle, working people kept fighting and discovered a fundamental truth that carries us to this day: You can’t stop all of us.We are an unassailable force when—and only when—we stand together.I remember back when my son Richard was young—maybe three or four years old. He and his buddy Chad were driving around in the backyard in one of those battery operated jeeps.He must have heard me talking on the phone, because he drove up and asked: “Dad, what’s a union?”So I told him to get out of the jeep and try to push it up the hill in our backyard.

I looked right at my son and said: “That’s a union...people doing things together that they can’t do alone.”Brothers and sisters, working people are climbing that hill. Every day. Against all odds.Solidarity got us here. And solidarity is going to take us forward.As the rules and tools of our economy continue to change...as the very nature of work itself evolves...we can win a future that advances us all.We can demand a world where the gains from technology translate into better pay and working conditions for everyone...where the rise of e-commerce means more delivery days, not fewer...where groundbreaking advances allow us to have better, safer and more interesting jobs.We can create a new era of universal prosperity, one where working people share in the unprecedented wealth that we have created.But here’s the thing: We won’t win as postal workers or steelworkers or teachers or miners. We won’t win as men or women, as black or white, as gay or straight.We will only win as a single movement of working people, from every region and every sector, fighting for the interests of all of our brothers and sisters...fighting for the rights and freedoms of all who live and work here.That’s our power! It doesn’t come from Washington or politicians or the courts.Our power lies in the 55 unions united through the AFL-CIO...in the nearly 13 million members who know they are surrounded by an army of brothers and sisters.Our power lies in the workers who are standing together, marching together and fighting
together in communities across the country, arms locked in unflinching solidarity.Together we can end the oppression that still hangs over us and secure the brighter future that we deserve.Together, we can win fairer pay, better benefits, and healthier, more fulfilling lives.Together, we can fight off all those who would deny us the fruits of our labor.Brothers and sisters, hear me loud and hear me clear. We’re not going to be held down or pushed around. We refuse to be walked over, talked over or told to sit down and shut up. We will not settle for less.Because we keep America safe. We build the roads, bring the mail and lift the loads. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day. We tuck her into bed at night. We’re the American labor movement, and we will not...we will not...be denied!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
217,Trumka to Railroad Signalmen: American Dream Built Through Solidarity ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-railroad-signalmen-american-dream-built-through-solidarity,8-7-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen 52nd Regular Convention:Good morning, BRS!Brother Dan (Pickett), thank you for all that you’ve done and continue to do for working people. You have been an unwavering leader of your union and an indispensable figure in the labor movement.Brothers and sisters, I’m thrilled to be here with you today.Guess what? It’s Election Day in Missouri.Today voters in the Show Me State will decide the future of right to work.I have to tell you: I am feeling confident. Working people needed 100,000 signatures to get that issue on the ballot. We submitted over 300,000.Our members and allies are going door to door. We’re making phone calls. We’re talking about good union jobs. We’re talking about world-class training programs. We’re talking about the power of collective action.And later tonight, with the help of this Brotherhood, Missouri is going to become the first state in history to overturn right to work by popular vote.Four years ago, I had the honor of standing with you at your convention in Las Vegas. And at the time, I talked about the fight facing working people. A struggle to bring about transformational change...to end the politics of cruelty...the politics of poverty...the politics of exclusion.Today, that twisted politics is being pushed more relentlessly than ever before. The corporate-apologists and union-busters are throwing everything they have at us.But we’re not flinching. We’re not going anywhere. We’re not going to stand for a politics that says a CEO is entitled to more dignity than a signalman. We’re not going to accept a politics that serves the few at the expense of the many.Brothers and sisters, we are choosing a different path.Working people are writing a comeback story unlike any I’ve seen in my 50 years in the labor movement. And the fact that we are rising up in the face of unprecedented attacks from corporations and those in power makes this moment all the more powerful.262,000 new members joined unions in 2017, three quarters of them under the age of 35...even as the Supreme Court continues to chip away at our freedoms.The popularity of unions is above 60 percent and rising...even as Congress pushes proposals to gut our job safety and retirement security.New research from MIT shows a remarkable 50 percent increase in the number of workers who would vote to join a union today...even as the Trump Administration seeks to slash Amtrak’s funding by half.Imagine what we could accomplish with leaders who actually fought for working people instead of trying to crush our unions and silence our collective voice.Well, I have a message for every politician, Republican or Democrat, who wants to delay or derail our progress: Get on board or get the hell out of our way!It’s time to fight like hell, brothers and sisters...for a better future...for a better life…for the values that your Brotherhood has embodied for 117 years.Let’s reclaim America for the people who build it and make it work!Let’s reclaim the future for all of our kids—not just the children of privilege.Let’s organize and mobilize like never before!Let’s show every robber baron and corporate hack that we aren’t going anywhere!We’re spoiling for a fight. I say, bring it on! We've taken their best shot, and we're still standing. We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united.This is our country...and it’s time...high time...we took it back!Brothers and sisters, I have a confession to make. And, I trust you won’t tell our comrades putting in a hard day’s work over at Logan Airport. But, when you travel as much as I do...boy, nothing beats a train.From the station to the platform to the incredible people you meet along the way, it's like nothing else. And I know some of the most important work is going on behind the scenes as you install, inspect and maintain the systems that ensure we can return home safely to our families.Yet even with all of its advantages...even with competitors in Europe and Asia making it a top priority, too many of our leaders still treat rail as an afterthought.Per capita, Japan and the EU both spend three times more on their rail infrastructure than we do. It’s a global embarrassment.President Trump campaigned on massive investments in our infrastructure. So where’s the bill? Where’s the plan? Where’s the money?I don’t know about you, but I want faster trains. I want modern tunnels. I want expanded capacity. I want MORE rail jobs.Instead of a $1.5 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest Americans, how about we invest $1.5 trillion in our nation’s infrastructure?  Finally committing to a 21st century rail system is one important step to building an America that works for working people. And there’s no one better to make our case than the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen.Your union is integrally tied to the story of America. Your legacy is a testament to what makes the labor movement powerful. And above all, you are evidence of the inalienable value of work.You—like your brothers and sisters who came before you—are in the business of uniting a nation. A network of steel spanning a continent, reaching communities from coast to coast, shrinking the thousands of miles separating families in New York and Los Angeles and Miami and Seattle and everywhere in between.It’s a feat of human achievement, and you attend to it 24 hours a day. It’s your skill and your commitment and your tireless work that guides our people safely along the rails—through harsh weather, busy holidays and all the challenges you face every day.You’ve earned fair treatment. You’ve earned a secure livelihood. You’ve earned respect from our leaders.But, the corporate class has other plans.They want to privatize transportation and sell it off to the highest bidder.They want to turn your pension into pennies.They want to destroy your job security.They want to stall and kill rail safety rules.Until a few months ago, the FRA was being led by a guy who ran a PR firm on the side.You know better than anyone that keeping Americans safe and sound isn’t a part-time job.But you know what? Neither is standing up for our rights on the job.I need all of your passion...all of your fire...every ounce of sweat...as we fight for our future.Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?We’re gonna fight for better infrastructure and safer railroads!We’re gonna fight for our pensions!We’re gonna fight for a fully-funded Amtrak!We’re gonna fight for good jobs and strong unions and better lives!We’ve earned it, brothers and sisters! And, we’re here to collect what’s ours!But I won’t sugar coat it. The path ahead is going to be tough.Because here’s the truth: throughout the entire history of our movement, we’ve never had anything handed to us.Frederick Douglass once said, “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.”A fitting summary of the labor movement if there’s ever been one.Brothers and sisters, we have fought for every victory. We bled to secure our right to stand together and bargain collectively. We marched and sacrificed to end child labor. We faced down the powers of Washington and Wall Street to win a minimum wage.Every speck of progress was clawed from the hands of those who said we were asking too much...who tried to destroy us with one hand and dismissed us as radicals and extremists with the other.In the face of seemingly insurmountable opposition, we steadily built a fairer economy and a more just society...because we had one advantage on our side: Solidarity.American greatness...American decency...the American Dream itself was built through solidarity.The boss could fire one or two or even a factory full of us. They could shoot at a crowd and even kill some of us.But bonded by a common struggle, working people kept fighting and discovered a fundamental truth that carries us to this day: You can’t stop all of us.We are a force unto our own when—and only when—we stand together.I remember back when my son Rich was young—maybe three or four years old. He and his buddy Chad were driving around in the backyard in one of those battery operated jeeps.He must have heard me talking on the phone, because he drove up and asked: “Dad, what’s a union?”So I told him to try to push his jeep up the hill in our backyard. He strained and struggled, but he couldn’t get it up the hill. Then I told his friend Chad to give him a hand. Working together, they got the job done. I looked right at my son and said: “That’s a union.”That’s how we won the battles of yesterday. Brothers and sisters, that’s exactly how we’re going to win the fights of today and tomorrow.As the rules and tools of our economy continue to change...as the very nature of work itself evolves...we can win a future that advances us all.We can demand a world where the gains from technology translate into better pay and working conditions for everyone, where being more productive means we can work less and live more, where artificial intelligence allows us to have better, safer and more interesting jobs.We can create a new era of universal prosperity, one where working people share in the unprecedented wealth that we have created.But here’s the thing: We won’t win as signalmen or teachers or letter carriers or nurses or firefighters. We won’t win as men or women, as black or white, as gay or straight.We will only win as a single movement of working people, from every region and every sector, fighting for the interests of all of our brothers and sisters...fighting for the rights and freedoms of all who live and work here.That’s our power! It doesn’t come from Washington or politicians or the courts.Our power lies in the 55 powerful unions united through the AFL-CIO...in the nearly 13 million members who know that the House of Labor is their house.Our power lies in the workers who are standing together, marching together and fighting together in communities across the country, arms locked in unflinching solidarity.We’re witnessing that power today in Missouri. Our victory will be proof positive that we’re not ceding an inch after the Supreme Court took a shot at us with Janus. And, it’s a preview of what’s to come in November and beyond.Eugene Debs, who famously led the Pullman Railroad Strike, said that “the political solidarity of the working class means the death of despotism, the birth of freedom, the sunrise of civilization.”Brothers and sisters, the sun is rising in America!Together we can end the oppression that still hangs over us and secure the brighter future that lies ahead.Together, we can win fairer pay, better benefits, and healthier, more fulfilling lives.Together, we can fight off all those who would deny us the fruits of our labor.Hear me loud and hear me clear. We’re not going to be held down or pushed around. We refuse to be walked over, talked over or told to sit down and shut up. We will not settle for less.Because we keep America safe. We build the roads, bake the bread and lift the loads. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day. We tuck her into bed at night. We’re the American labor movement, and we will not...we will not...be denied!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
218,Trumka Highlights Worker Uprising at Christian Science Monitor Breakfast ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-highlights-worker-uprising-christian-science-monitor-breakfast,8-1-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Christian Science Monitor Breakfast: Good morning. Thank you to the Christian Science Monitor for hosting this breakfast once again, and thanks to each of you for joining us here today. What a year it has already been.Back in January, I was asked what victory looks like for the labor movement. And I said you’ll know unions are on the rise when more workers start realizing our own value.Well, it’s happening. We’re living through the kind of defining moment that can leave its mark for a generation. A moment that will determine what kind of economy we work in and what kind of society we live in.But this uprising isn’t in Washington, on Wall Street or in corporate boardrooms. In fact, it’s a direct response to the failure of these institutions.If you want to know what’s really happening in America, look in the streets...look in America’s workplaces and union halls and community centers. Everywhere, there is a surge in collective action.Look, I’ve been in the labor movement for 50 years. This is unlike anything I’ve seen in a long, long time. Workers from all sectors and backgrounds and communities are joining together and organizing.And this progress has been won in the face of a corporate political class that has never had more money, influence or sinister intentions.262,000 new members joined unions in 2017, three quarters of them under the age of 35...even as the Supreme Court continues to chip away at our freedoms.The popularity of unions is above 60 percent and rising...even as Congress pushes proposals to gut our financial, health care and retirement security.And research from MIT shows the number of workers who would vote to join a union today has doubled...even as the Trump Administration uses its executive power to attack federal workers and make our workplaces substantially more dangerous.Imagine what we could accomplish with leaders who actually fought for working people...or at least stayed out of our way...rather than trying to crush our unions and silence our collective voice.The fact is...working people are taking matters into our own hands. We’re looking inward to position ourselves to shape the future of work and the labor movement. We’re organizing. We’re mobilizing. And we’re winning.We know that a union contract is the single best way to secure higher pay, better benefits, safer jobs and more secure retirement. Just look at the recent Princeton University study finding that unions consistently provided workers with a 10 to 20 percent wage boost over an 80-year period.So our job this election season is to secure that promise for even more working people...by filling the halls of power with genuine champions of collective bargaining.We’ve proven what we can do on the campaign trail, from Virginia to Alabama to Pennsylvania. And we’re already mobilizing our members, one conversation at a time. We’re unleashing the largest and most strategic member to member political program in our history, sparking change by doing what organizers do best: talking to each other.And if you want to see that power on full display, just look at what’s going on in Missouri right now.The legislature and now ex-governor ignored the interests and voices of working people. They listened to the whispers of a few right-wing, corporate billionaires, and jammed through a wrongheaded “right to work” law that threatens to lower workers’ pay by more than $8,700.So, working people took matters into our own hands. We were tasked with getting 100,000 signatures to put the law to a statewide vote.You know what we did? We organized and turned in more than 300,000 signatures.The election is Tuesday. And let me tell you something: we’re going to win.We’re going to win because it’s what workers want and making our voices heard is what we do best.We’re knocking on doors, making calls and visiting worksites. We’re mobilizing, street-by-street and person-by-person, showing our power and our passion for our issues...the things that affect us every day at our jobs and in our lives.It’s proof positive that we’re not ceding an inch after the Janus case. And, it’s a preview of what’s to come in November and beyond.You’re looking for the big story? There it is. That’s where real power lies. And that’s who’s writing the story of 2018 and beyond.Thank you again. I’m looking forward to your questions.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
219,Trumka: Federal Employees Make America Strong ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-federal-employees-make-america-strong,7-25-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a rally in support of federal employees and AFGE: Thank you, Brother J. David (Cox)! Your leadership in the face of ruthless attacks is an inspiration to working people everywhere. There’s no one I’d rather have leading this fight, and it’s an honor to call you my brother.Folks, this is a time of enormous challenge. This administration and the corporate right-wing are coming after our most fundamental rights and freedoms. They’re attacking the dignity of the public servants who make our country work. They’re trying to strip our collective bargaining rights...our voice on the job...our very way of life.Brothers and sisters, we’re not going to take it!Because here’s the truth: throughout the entire history of our movement, we’ve never had anything handed to us. I see all the red here today and I am reminded that our movement was built on the blood of those who came before us.We’ve fought for every victory. We stopped child labor. We brought you the weekend. We made health care more affordable and accessible. And we made the federal government a place where you can work hard, raise a family and get ahead.Brothers and sisters, that’s why they’re coming after AFGE. You are the embodiment of what the labor movement can and should be. And they don’t like it. You organize in a right to work environment every day of every year. And guess what? You’re still growing. So now President Trump wants to change the rules of the game. Well I have a message for him: not on our watch!It’s time to fight like hell...to end the injustice plaguing us...to end the indignity we face...to end the inequality crippling our country...to end the egregious idea that exploitation is good government.This is our moment to reclaim America for the people who build it and the public servants who make it work!

Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT?This is our country...the nation you serve every day...and it’s high time...high time...we took it back!They want to take away our freedom to bargain. WE SAY HELL NO!They want to silence our voice. WE SAY HELL NO!They want to demonize those who serve our country. WE SAY HELL NO!They want to us to sit down and shut up. WE SAY HELL NO!Because we care for our veterans. We serve our seniors. We protect our environment. We keep America healthy. We keep America safe. We make America strong.And no one...I mean no one...is going to push us around.Thank you. God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
220,Trumka Offers Passionate Defense of Letter Carriers ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-offers-passionate-defense-letter-carriers,7-20-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the National Association of Letter Carriers' 71st Biennial National Convention:Good morning, NALC! It’s great to be back here in Detroit!Brother Fred (Rolando), thank you for that introduction and for all that you do for working people. You are truly one of the great leaders of our movement, and it’s an honor to call you my friend.Brothers and sisters, I want to start by extending my deepest sympathies to the friends and family of Peggy Frank. To all of her brothers and sisters at Branch 2902, know that the entire labor movement grieves with you.Peggy was a mother and grandmother who, for nearly three decades, committed herself to public service. She did the important work of connecting her community and our nation—one home at a time. Peggy had more than earned the retirement she was looking forward to in just a few months.But after being sent out in 117 degree weather...dragging a mailbag...driving a truck without air conditioning...those golden years were taken from her, and she was taken from her family.Peggy defined service. She embodied sacrifice. She was the very essence of the National Association of Letter Carriers.We will not let Peggy die in vain. It’s time to fight like hell...to end the injustice plaguing us...to end the indignity we face...to end the inequality crippling our country...to end the egregious idea that exploitation is the cost of doing business.This is our time to reclaim America for the people who build it and make it work!Brothers and sisters, are you ready to fight? ARE YOU READY TO FIGHT? Let’s honor our sister the best way we know how: Organize. Mobilize. Bargain. Agitate. March. Register. Vote.This is our country...and it’s high time we took it back!I can’t think of a better union to carry our banner forward than NALC. At a time of enormous challenge, you’ve demonstrated the labor movement’s power. You’ve proven working people’s ability to change the world for the better.You do it in your locals and at your worksites every single day. Even in an open shop, you have organized 93% of workers. And we're going to get that other 7%! If you want to know how we’re going to organize after Janus, ask a letter carrier!But your reach isn’t limited to your union halls. You’ve proven yourselves in your communities.I had the privilege of stopping by NALC headquarters in May to help kick off your annual food drive. I saw your brothers and sisters preparing to carry out that unparalleled, nationwide act of compassion.You’re owed a huge debt of gratitude. It’s a big job. The largest one-day food drive in the world, in fact. 1.6 billion pounds of food...collected over a quarter-century...in more than 10,000 cities and towns.On behalf of a grateful labor movement, I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you.Service is what you do. It’s what you’ve always done. You are in a league of your own. From New York City to the most remote outposts of Alaska...for nearly two and a half centuries, your work has enabled that fundamental American idea...E pluribus unum...out of many, one.You are government at its best—diligently serving the needs of all those who live and work here.So, when I hear right-wingers talk about breaking up the Post Office and selling it off to the highest bidder, I start to wonder...what don’t they want to privatize? What don’t they want to put in the hands of corporations?Brothers and sisters, nothing gets me quite as riled up as when some know-nothing tells us how to do our jobs. President Trump isn’t the first politician to come after the men and women of the Postal Service. And he certainly won’t be the last.The corporate right-wing wants to reduce mail delivery. They want to cut your benefits, slash your pay and destroy your union! They are the ones who imposed the ridiculous and unfair pre-funding requirements on your health care plans.Well I’ve got a message for every single corporate hack that wants to upend your lives to line their own pockets: Letter carriers don’t just deliver the mail. They also know how to deliver a giant can of whoopass.Listen up, haters!We’re going to beat back these attacks.We’re going to defend the Postal Service.We’re going to defend our unions.We’re going to defend our communities, our country and the working people who serve them!And if you corporate thugs want to get to the hard working folks of the NALC, you’ve got 13 million more of us to get through first!Now I know this won’t be easy.The Trump Administration is pursuing a broken corporate ideology with a fervor and recklessness that I have never seen.Meanwhile, it’s failing in its most fundamental responsibilities...failing to deliver the basic services that a government is supposed to provide.Just think about this. The Postal Service’s board of governors has nine members. Anyone know how many vacancies there are?Nine!Without a Board of Governors, the Postal Service is functioning under what's called ""temporary emergency status."" You can't plan. You can't make decisions. You can't make the investments you need. You can't address any of the challenges facing the agency.That's no way to run a government. And boy, ""temporary emergency"" is a pretty fitting term for how this administration does its business.This isn’t about partisanship. This isn’t about politics. This is about doing your job. And brothers and sisters, you know better than anyone…if you want the job done right, you better do it yourself! That’s why working people are taking the future into our own hands.Brothers and sisters, in this moment, it’s on us to do the extraordinary.The elite political class is throwing everything they have at us. The nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is just the latest insult.Kavanagh has routinely ruled against working people. He is a threat to our pocketbooks...our safety...our very way of life. And that’s why we’re calling on the Senate to reject his nomination.But even as the Court delivers us blow after blow...even as President Trump tries to privatize the Post Office and rolls back regulations designed to protect us on the job...working people are writing a comeback story.We’ve never looked to Washington to validate our movement. We’ve never relied on politicians for our strength.Our power lies in the hundreds of thousands of workers carrying new union cards—three
quarters of them under 35.It lies in the tens of millions more who would vote today to join a union if given the chance.Our power lies in the workers who are standing together, marching together and fighting
together in communities across the country, in every region and every sector, arms locked tight together in solidarity.That’s our power. And we intend on using it to break corporations’ hold on our politics...to take back Washington and state houses and city halls for working people...to stop the cycle of broken promises...to end the barrage of knives stuck in our back.We’re unleashing the largest and most strategic member to member political program in our history.That’s how we win elections. We’ve done it in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and California and Wisconsin and Virginia.Now we’re taking this wave across the country!You’re already leading the charge. As we speak, letter carriers in Missouri are mobilizing and organizing against a despicable, corporate-backed right to work referendum. And I can’t say for sure...but I imagine other folks are having a hard time keeping up with them on the doors.Brothers and sisters, we have the chance to take our country back. To truly make America great.But, it won’t just happen. We need you. Every single one of you.Because two is stronger than one.I remember back when my son Rich was young—maybe three or four years old. He and his buddy Chad were driving around in the backyard in one of those battery operated jeeps.He must have heard me talking on the phone, because he drove up and asked: “Dad, what’s a union?”So I told him to try to push his jeep up the hill in our backyard. He strained and struggled, but he couldn’t get it up the hill. Then I told his friend Chad to give him a hand. Working together, they got the job done. I looked right at my son and said: “That’s a union...people doing things together that they can't do alone.”All these years later, even in the face of these enormous challenges, I know we can and we will win a new day for working people…together. Only together can we get that jeep over the hill. Only together can we secure what we’re constantly told is impossible. Only together can we hand a brighter future to our kids.Thinking about my son...and now my grandson...I’m reminded of who we are fighting for.The children...the future...that's what our labor movement is all about! That's who we're walking for! That’sThinking about my son...and now my grandson...I’m reminded of who we are fighting for…and what we’re up against. Our opponents are well-funded and ruthless. They’ve rigged the rules. They’ve called us names. They’ve tried privatize our jobs. They’ve told us unions aren’t welcome. I say, bring it on! We’ve taken your best shot and we’re still standing. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united. It is time…it is high time…for us to take America back! Because we’re the ones who carry the mail and teach the classes. We make the roads, bake the bread and lift the loads. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day. We tuck her into bed at night. We’re the American labor movement, and we will not be denied!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
221,Trumka Rallies Missouri AFL-CIO Convention to Defeat Proposition A ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-rallies-missouri-afl-cio-convention-defeat-proposition,7-17-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the 29th Biennial Missouri AFL-CIO Convention:Good morning, brothers and sisters. It’s great to be back in St. Louis. What has it been...three weeks? I feel like I should buy a house here. Thank you, Brother Mike (Louis), for that very kind introduction. You are doing an outstanding job leading the Missouri labor movement through some very challenging times.On October 14, 1936, at the dedication of the War Memorial here in St. Louis, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called on us to correct the inequalities plaguing our society. He said ""true patriotism urges us to build an even more substantial America where the good things of life may be shared by more of us."" And he called on working people from all occupations...from all walks of life...to come together for the mutual advantage of themselves and America as a whole.Yet today, the inequalities FDR described more than 80 years ago still persist. Too many of us are still not sharing in the good things of life. And the solution remains steadfast solidarity...where we all rise together to strengthen the country we love.At his second inauguration, four years into the New Deal, FDR noted that America faced a fundamental decision. Would we decide that some progress was good enough? Or would we continue further down the path toward a brighter, more just future for everyone? His answer was clear. He said ""the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.""We face our own decision today...our own test of progress. And just as FDR had to battle the forces of wealth and greed in his time, we now must confront a corporate onslaught of historic proportions. They want to rip apart the New Deal piece by piece. They want to bankrupt our unions. They want to leave us poor and weak and divided. And the Supreme Court just did their bidding, flushing 41 years of fairness down the toilet in Janus v. AFSCME.These corporate leeches, wrapped in the American flag and hijacking words like “freedom” and “rights,” have brought the fight here to Missouri. They think they can steamroll us into submission. They think they can send us running for the hills. Well, brothers and sisters, I’ve got news for them: the only place we’re running is to the polls on August 7 to defeat Proposition A!I was recently here in St. Louis for our Labor 2018 kickoff at Laborers Local 42. As I looked around that union hall, I was struck by the number of parents who brought their children. It was inspiring to see. Because quite frankly, that's what this election is all about. That's who we're walking for. That’s who we're door knocking for. That’s who we're fighting for. And that’s why we're going to vote no. So those kids have a future! So those kids can sign a union card! So those kids can build their American Dream!You know, I'm a student of the Civil War. History books talk a lot about the leaders. General A did this. General B did that. They don’t talk a lot about the people who really won battles and won wars. They don’t talk about a private or a corporal who sacrificed their own lives for a brother or a sister next to them. You see, the uncommon heroes are workers. People like us. The rank and file. The soldier who's in the trenches. Because when ordinary people come together, we can do extraordinary things.One of these heroes is Quiema Spencer, a pipefitter in Kansas City. As a gay, black woman...she hasn’t had it easy. She's always had to work that much harder to build a better life. But, she says it wasn't until she joined a union that she truly found her voice. Locking arms with her brothers and sisters in Pipe Fitters Local 533, she realized that we don’t have to take the crumbs we’re being handed anymore. Together, we can demand better. Now Quiema  is knocking doors and making calls...so every working person in this state and across the country can find their voice, just like she did.You see, the Missouri labor movement defines extraordinary. You needed 100,000 signatures to get right to work on the ballot. You got over 300,000. 213,000 of those were collected by volunteers. Now you are in the process on knocking on hundreds of thousands of doors. Don’t let up. The next three weeks will make the difference. Let’s stand together...union proud and union strong. This is our time. This is our moment.Brothers and sisters, hear me loud and hear me clear: We defeated right to work in 1978. And we’re going to defeat it again in 2018!When we win here on August 7, it’s going to be the shot heard round the world. It’ll make waves in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Ohio and Washington D.C. And it will provide a powerful rebuke of the Supreme Court’s disgraceful ruling in Janus.Janus is the latest misguided decision by the most corporate-friendly Supreme Court in our history. It was a case solicited, argued and decided by the wealthiest few. And I have no doubt that President Trump’s nominee to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, Brett Kavanaugh, would make life even harder for our families and communities. Kavanaugh has routinely ruled against working people. He is a threat to our pocketbooks...our safety...our very way of life. When he was announced, Judge Kavanaugh talked a lot about his Catholic roots. But don’t be fooled. He worships at the altar of corporations. And that’s why we’re calling on the Senate to reject his nomination.In the end, I believe Janus will be a footnote. The labor movement has never depended on any politician or judge to decide our fate. And we aren’t about to start now. We will define this moment in history with our organizing.I stand before you today, 50 years into my union career, as optimistic as ever. Something is happening in America. It’s beautiful. It’s real. And it can’t be contained by 5 Supreme Court justices or an anti-worker Congress or even the president of the United States. Workers are organizing and striking as we haven’t seen in years. 15,000 workers joined or formed unions in a single week this April. That’s on top of the 262,000 new members who joined our ranks last year—75 percent of them under the age of 35. And this is despite the fact that too many of our labor laws have been written to undermine the freedom to organize. New research from MIT shows that the number of non-union workers who would vote to join a union today has increased dramatically over the past several decades. Tens of millions of workers are ready to experience the transformational power of collective bargaining.A little more than eight months ago, we gathered at America’s Center, not far from this hotel, for the AFL-CIO Convention. We declared to ourselves and the world that the labor movement is here to stay. We left St. Louis with a clear vision and mission based on one unmistakable truth: we have the power.In the months since, that vision has come to life. Countless young people are reaching for the rights and dignities of union membership. Teachers are striking and marching for the respect that they’ve earned. Workers across the Show Me State are showing us what’s possible when we come together as one.Brothers and sisters, we’re not going to be held down or pushed around. We refuse to be walked over, talked over or told to sit down and shut up. We will not settle for less.It is time…it is high time…for us to take America back! We’re the ones who build the cars and teach the classes. We make the roads, bake the bread and lift the loads. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day. We tuck her into bed at night. We’re the American labor movement, and we will not be denied!A victory on August 7 can help set the table for a pro-worker wave this fall. In communities across the country, we have unleashed the largest and most strategic member to member political program in our history, sparking change by doing what organizers do best: talking to each other.Street-by-street and person-by-person, we’re having conversations about the issues that matter most. Higher wages, better benefits, time off, a secure retirement and a fair return on our labor. And by starting now and putting our agenda first, we’ll be able to cut through the BS of October and November.Each of you are on the front lines of a revolution—a revolution of working people fighting for our fair share of the prosperity we built—a movement demanding what we deserve! That’s how we win elections. We’ve done it in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and California and Wisconsin and Virginia. Missouri is next!But, it won’t just happen. We need you. Every single one of you.Our unions can and will transform lives…and unionism will transform America. A new paper from Princeton University shows that union workers earn about 20 percent more than nonunion workers in similar jobs. That’s life-changing. And the union advantage is even more dramatic for women and people of color.As we stand together…as more Americans see us exercise our collective power…more people will be inspired to join us.Our job today, and every day heading into the midterm elections, is to turn our activism into real political power by continuing to build momentum for an independent and issue-based agenda for working people.And after the election, we’re going to use our electoral power to win more organizing fights, bargain better contracts and build a better America. That’s what President Trump promised us, but it’s not what he’s delivered.Instead of progress, we got a historic, budget-busting tax giveaway for multinational corporations, Wall Street and billionaires. And now House Republicans want to slash $1.5 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid—and even more from Social Security—to pay for it.Instead of new economic rules, we got rollbacks on regulations designed to protect our pay and keep us healthy and safe at work.Instead of better jobs, we got broken promises on infrastructure, extremist judicial nominees and 800 laid off Harley Davidson workers here in Missouri.But let me tell you something. Our solidarity is bigger than any of these attacks. The corporate billionaires can’t touch our solidarity... and when they attack our institutions…when they attack our ability to fight for our members and our communities…we’ll fight back. We will fight back against every attack on working people, and we’ll fight hard…we’ll fight to win!As we fight…as we educate our members…as we campaign this summer and fall, we’ll spell out our issue-based agenda again and again. We don’t work for any political party. You’ve shown that here in Missouri time and time again, using relationships on both sides of the aisle in Jefferson City to beat back attacks on dues deduction and prevailing wage. Remember, we work for workers. We want more Republicans who will break ranks and stand with working people. And while we’re at it, we want fewer Democrats who take our money and energy and then forget who got them elected in the first place.We want champions of working families. Bold, fearless leaders who say “UNION” loud and proud, and not just on Labor Day.To earn and keep our support, you have to be an advocate for our agenda. That means helping us pass labor law reform so aspiring union members can organize freely and fairly. It means health care as a fundamental right, the expansion of Social Security and guaranteed pensions. It means trillions of dollars so we can build the best infrastructure in the world with union labor and prevailing wages.It means trade deals that actually work for working people and a tax code that invests in American jobs and American workers. And it means comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that reunites our families and ends the terror in our workplaces and our communities.We want everybody to have access to the American Dream. I don’t think that’s too much to ask.Recently, I was thinking about my high school football coach. His name was Bear Stuvek. Bear was one tough son of a miner. He taught me about perseverance and dedication and good, old-fashioned hard work. Bear used to put us through a drill called “Bull in the Ring.” I am certain it would be banned today.Twelve of my teammates would circle around me. Bear would count off...1, 2, 3, 4...1, 2, 3, 4. He’d call the ones. They’d come and hit me. Then the twos. Then the threes and so on. Bear would keep calling their numbers. And I’d keep getting hit harder and harder. Sometimes I’d be on the ground and wonder whether I should get up. Somehow I always did.Before long, when Bear would put me in that ring, I’d start hitting back. I’d hit back with everything I had. I’d hit back until they finally got the message that while you may knock me down, you will never...and I mean never...knock me out.The labor movement...we are that bull in the ring. We’ve been getting hit over and over again. Every day. From every direction. They’ve held down our pay. They’ve attacked our health care. They’ve tried to kill our pensions, destroy our jobs and leave us begging for scraps. They want national right to work. They want to make the Supreme Court a corporate board room.Well guess what? Their time is up. Unions are on the move. In every city and every state. Young and old. Black and white. Immigrant and native-born. Gay and straight. Rural and urban. Republican and Democrat.We’re spoiling for a fight. I say, bring it on! We've taken their best shot, and we're still standing. We’re the true American patriots. We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united. We’re rising in solidarity…real solidarity…where your picket line is my picket line, and my picket line is your picket line. And we won’t stop until we take our country back.  Thank you! God bless you! On to August 7!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
222,Trumka Asks Democratic Candidates:  Will You Be a Fighter for Working Families?,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-asks-democratic-candidates-will-you-be-fighter-working-families,7-12-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the following remarks to Democratic House candidates: Thank you, Congressman (Mark) Pocan, for that very kind introduction. It is a pleasure to be here today. I look forward to a great conversation.Each of you are running for Congress at a time of serious challenge but also significant opportunity for working people.Let me start with the challenges. For four decades, the economic rules have been written to make corporations stronger at our expense. We are working longer and harder for less money. Our trade policies have shipped good American jobs overseas. Our tax policies have rewarded wealth instead of work. Our health care and retirement security are under constant attack. And there have never been more obstacles to forming a union.Two weeks ago yesterday, the Supreme Court, emboldened by a stolen seat, added insult to injury by ripping up 41 years of commonsense precedent to give even more money and power to corporations. It was one of the most disgraceful decisions in our nation’s history and I have no doubt that President Trump’s nominee would tilt the Court even further in the wrong direction. Working people are united: Brett Kavanaugh must be defeated.But even as the Court delivers us blow after blow...even as President Trump rolls back regulations designed to protect us on the job...even as House Republicans write a budget that would slash $1.5 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid—and even more from Social Security—to pay for their reckless, unnecessary tax cut...even as we face this onslaught, working people are writing a comeback story.I stand before you as optimistic as ever. And this is coming from a guy who just got his 50-year union pin. Something is happening in America. Collective action is on the rise. The teacher strikes. The #MeToo movement. Black Lives Matter. Students speaking out for safer schools. From coast to coast, ordinary people are recognizing that the best way to win justice is by standing with the person next to us.Workers are organizing and striking as we haven’t seen in years. 15,000 workers joined or formed unions in a single week this April. That’s on top of the 262,000 new members who joined our ranks last year—75 percent of them under the age of 35. And this is despite the fact that too many of our labor laws have been written to undermine the freedom to organize. New research from MIT shows that the number of non-union workers who would vote to join a union today has increased dramatically. Tens of millions of workers are ready to experience the transformational power of collective bargaining. And in many cases, all that stands in the way is a rigged system.That’s where you come in. I’ll be honest with you. Our members don’t care about red to blue. Or blue to red. Or any other color or partisan label. We have many great champions in the Democratic Party. Some of them are here with us today.But there is no denying that too many Democrats continue to disappoint us, voting with Wall Street on key issues like trade and financial reform. Quite frankly, there is nothing worse than seeing a candidate we endorse come to Washington and forget who got them elected in the first place. That’s how you end up with a third of union members voting for Donald Trump.If I’ve learned one thing over my half century in the labor movement, it’s that working people will persevere. We’ll keep climbing that mountain, either with you or without you. But it’d be a heckuva of a lot easier for us...and for you...if we made that journey together.I don’t have to tell you that you can’t count on the D next to your name to gain our support. Our members are focused on the issues that affect us everyday. That’s where you win our vote.And we are ready to move heaven and earth to help a genuine ally. Just look at Conor Lamb. He embraced our agenda. He committed to fight alongside us. He talked about unions loud and proud! So, we showed up and made the difference in that extremely close race. Today, Congressman Lamb is delivering on his promises. He is standing with us. And we are standing with him.I know you are laser focused on your district and your election. That’s how it should be. But I want you to take a look at the person next to you. Together, the men and women in this room have the power to secure a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. It’s been a while—nearly a decade. So ask yourself this question: why do you want it? Why do you want to be in the majority? Why do you want to be a member of Congress?Working people are marching and striking and organizing under the most trying of circumstances. We are moving the needle with the wind squarely in our face. Just imagine what we could accomplish if our political leaders protected and strengthened our rights.In the 2016 presidential election, and the two midterms that preceded it, union members often couldn’t see a difference between the two parties when it came to fighting for workers and standing up to Wall Street.Gilbert, a Hispanic union bus driver from Miami, put it this way: “I was pretty much raised as a Democrat, and then I switched. Democrats [used to be] very traditional, very American. That was me [and] my family. Now...Democrats are getting away from that...they’re not talking about strong labor unions or about America. I guess that's why Trump won. He spoke to traditional Americans losing their jobs...coal miners...factory workers.”I wanted you to hear that.Because each of you has a decision to make. Will you be a fighter for working families? Or will you be another corporate-beholden Democrat?To earn and keep our support, you have to be an advocate for our agenda. More than anything, that means helping us pass the Workers' Freedom to Negotiate Act so aspiring union members can organize freely and fairly. It means health care as a fundamental right, the expansion of Social Security and guaranteed pensions. It means trillions of dollars so we can build the best infrastructure in the world with union labor and prevailing wages.It means trade deals that actually work for working people and a tax code that invests in American jobs and American workers. And it means comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that reunites our families and ends the terror in our workplaces and our communities.If we work together, we can build on the foundation teachers and firefighters and construction workers and flight attendants are laying each and every day. We can stop some of the worst abuses of the corporate right-wing. We can start the process of rewriting our economic rules once and for all. And we can make our country a place where every person and every family has an opportunity to realize the American Dream.Thank you very much. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
223,Trumka: Janus Will Be a Footnote ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-janus-will-be-footnote,6-28-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a press conference with House and Senate Democrats highlighting their ""Better Deal"" labor law reform proposals:Good morning.I want to thank Leader Pelosi, Leader Schumer and all the pro-worker elected officials who have joined us here today.I also want to thank my fellow labor leaders who continue to show poise and grace while under relentless attack.And finally, I want to recognize all the union members—present and future—who inspire us to keep fighting every single day.Obviously, we are disappointed with the Supreme Court’s decision in Janus v. AFSCME.A narrow five-justice majority, emboldened by a stolen seat, overturned four decades of common sense precedent.It’s the latest misguided action by the most corporate-friendly Court in our history.But make no mistake I stand before you as optimistic as ever. And this is coming from a guy who just got his 50-year union pin.The labor movement has never depended on any politician or judge to decide our fate and we aren’t about to start now.In the end, Janus will be a footnote. This moment in history is being defined by our organizing.Something is happening in America. It’s beautiful. It’s real. And it can’t be contained by 5 justices or 51 Republican senators or even the president of the United States.All over the country, workers are organizing and striking as we haven’t seen in years.15,000 workers joined or formed unions in a single week this April.That’s on top of the 262,000 new members who joined our ranks last year—75 percent of them under the age of 35.And this is despite the fact that too many of our labor laws have been written to undermine the freedom to organize.New research from MIT shows a 50 percent increase in the number of non-union workers who would vote to join a union today.Tens of millions of workers are ready to experience the transformational power of collective bargaining.

And in many cases, all that stands in the way is a rigged system.The “Better Deal” labor law reform bills introduced by House and Senate Democrats...the Workers Freedom to Negotiate Act and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act...are a major step in the right directionThey would strengthen the freedom to organize by expanding the law so millions of additional workers can access collective bargaining…remove substantial chunks of the anti-worker Taft-Hartley Act…and make the process for forming a union and reaching a first contract fairer.We are proud to endorse these bills.And any candidate who wants the support of working people must do the same.Let me be clear: The Supreme Court is on the wrong side of history.What they did flies in the face of where workers want to go and need to go. It shows just how out of touch they are with our country. Janus or no Janus…workers are demanding a voice.We are standing up and speaking out for a better life.We are demanding a fair share of the wealth we help create.We are marching and organizing and bargaining.And we simply will not allow a corporate-controlled Supreme Court to stop us from doing our job.Thank you again for putting forward this “Better Deal.”We look forward to helping you pass it into law.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

224,Trumka Kicks Off Labor 2018,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-kicks-labor-2018,6-23-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks kicking off Labor 2018 at Laborers Local 42 in St. Louis: Brothers and sisters, it’s great to be back in Missouri!Just about eight months ago, we came together in this great city for the AFL-CIO Convention. We declared to ourselves and the world that the labor movement is here to stay. We left St. Louis with a clear vision and mission based on one unmistakable truth: we are the change we’ve been looking for.In the months since, the power of the labor movement has been on full display. Tens of thousands of new members have signed union cards. Countless young people are reaching for the rights and dignities that come with a collective bargaining agreement. We will never forget the images of teachers marching and chanting for the respect that they’ve earned. Collective action is on the rise. Journalists in the West. Teaching assistants in the North. Boeing mechanics in the South. And workers at Dollar General right here in Missouri!Brothers and sisters, we have the power. We’re joining together, fighting together and winning together. And we’ve got to keep it up, because the next fight is coming quick.The same people waging a corporate-funded assault on worker freedom at the Supreme Court have targeted Missouri for decades. You have the scars to prove it!Let me be clear. Proposition A will lower wages, destroy jobs, increase poverty and make pay even less equal for working women. Above all, Prop A will undermine our collective voice on the issues important to our lives.The corporate politicians want us to sit down and shut up. That’s why they moved the vote to August. They think we’ll stay home. Well I have news for them. This is the summer of workers. And we are going to prove the haters wrong by voting NO on August 7th. Let’s hit the doors today and tomorrow and the day after that. Talk to your friends and family! Pester your neighbors. We defeated right to work in 1978. And we’re going to defeat it again in 2018!A victory in August can help set the table for a pro-worker wave this fall.Today, in communities across the country, we’re kicking off our Labor 2018 campaign. We’re unleashing the largest and most strategic member to member political program in our history, sparking change by doing what organizers do best: talking to each other.Street-by-street and person-by-person, we’re having conversations about the issues that matter most. Higher wages, better benefits, time off, a secure retirement and a fair return on our labor. And by starting now and putting our agenda first, we’ll be able to cut through the television ad blitz and political noise of October and November.Each of you are on the front lines of a revolution—a revolution of working people fighting for our fair share of the prosperity we built—a movement demanding what we deserve!That’s how we win elections. We’ve done it in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and California and Wisconsin and Virginia. Missouri is next!But, it won’t just happen. We need you. Every single one of you.We have the chance to take our country back. To truly make America great.We can build a nation where union members fill the halls of power…where we earn a fair wage for a full day’s work...where there are more pro-labor Republicans and fewer corporate Democrats…where politicians rally alongside the labor movement instead of cowering behind Wall Street...where we assert our value and power as working people!Because this is our land. We make this country run. We’re teachers and steelworkers, nurses and coal miners, firefighters and letter carriers.WE are the American labor movement, the people who built this country into the most prosperous nation the world has ever known. And, we ain’t done yet.We’re marching forward. We’re fighting back. This is our moment. And if we stick together, no one has a chance in hell of stopping us.Thank you! Let’s do this!© 2023 AFL-CIO.

225,Trumka to UAW Convention: Unionism Will Transform America ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-uaw-convention-unionism-will-transform-america,6-13-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the 37th UAW Constitutional Convention:

UAW!Good morning! It’s great to be with you! What a welcome! Thank you… and thank you, Brother Dennis [Williams], for your generous introduction.Brothers and sisters, your president isn’t one to talk much about his legacy, but I want to say a few words about him. I’ve watched his stewardship of the UAW. He has made hard decisions. He has made responsible choices at every turn. When it comes to your contracts, he knows how to make solidarity real… to translate it into dollars and cents at the bargaining table. That’s a big deal. Dennis is a powerful union leader, a close ally of mine and a tremendous friend. I’m proud to call him my union brother. As I get into my remarks, Dennis, I just want to say thank you, congratulations on your term as president of the UAW, and God bless you, brother, for everything you do and everything you are.The UAW is an awesome union. You show us all what unionism can be. You show us with your contracts, your organizing and your mobilizing… and you show us with your long and passionate commitment to social justice. From the way you lifted up the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the entire civil rights movement, to the brave stand you took with Owen Bieber back in 1986, partnering with my union, the United Mine Workers, to help end apartheid in South Africa.Brothers and sisters, the well-being of working people in America is tied to the well-being of the United Auto Workers. When you thrive, we all do.And I want you to know that the entire AFL-CIO stands with you in every one of your fights. Whatever you need is what you’ll get.Over the past few years, the UAW has engaged in some high profile organizing campaigns. You’ve added something like 20,000 members since your last convention. That’s powerful. It’s also true that you’ve gone up against some incredible anti-union campaigns. Some of those votes came up short, and that’s painful… especially for each and every worker in Tennessee and Mississippi and all the places where people still want and need the security that comes with a union contract.You know, someone with a short-term point of view might score those organizing drives as losses, but I want you to consider what happened with teachers in West Virginia this year... in Oklahoma, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky and across red state America. I want you to consider how unionism has been growing as a mass movement in this country. I believe your campaigns… ALL OF THEM… have helped unleash a new and growing movement for solidarity in America.You lit that spark.This is big, and it’s just the beginning.  Something is happening in America! Unionism is on the rise. Our popularity has been growing for years. It’s well over 60%, the highest in nearly two decades, and it’s even higher among young workers. Listen to this: 75% of workers under 30 have a favorable view of unions, including 55% of young Republicans. Recently, 15,000 people formed unions in just a single week… and thousands of those workers were Harvard grad students who joined the UAW!That was a major victory at Harvard. You had another at Columbia and another with university workers in Washington State. You’ve organized new members at agricultural plants and auto parts suppliers.And when you went down to Canton, Mississippi and fought hard for Nissan workers against a wall-to-wall campaign of frankly illegal and immoral intimidation, you let regular working people know that the rich and powerful don’t hold all the cards. We will win some. We might come up short, but we’ll be back. And we will always stand up and fight for what we believe. Always. They don’t get to make every decision. This is our country, too!Brothers and sisters, unionism is the key. When we stand together, we have the power.We’re not going to be held down or pushed around. We refuse to be walked over, talked over or told to sit down and shut up.It is time… it is high time… for us to take America back! We’re the ones who build the cars and teach the classes. We make the roads, bake the bread and lift the loads. We stand tall. We don’t run and hide. We wake our country up every single day. We tuck her into bed at night. We’re the American labor movement, and we will not be denied!Brothers and sisters, I want to talk for a moment about your auto contracts, because with them you illustrate something very important.Back during the financial crisis, the UAW made deep sacrifices to give your employers a path forward. Your research team did its homework. Your bargaining teams did as well. It wasn’t easy, but you helped get America’s auto industry back on its feet… and by doing so, positioned yourself to win a better piece of the pie in your last round of bargaining.Workers who had been making $19 an hour will take home $31 by the end of this contract. And on top of that are your hard-earned profit-sharing checks.Let me tell you something: $5,500 at Chrysler… and that’s in a down year... to more than $11,000 at GM... is a lot of money. Those raises and those profit-sharing checks are life-changing. Your contracts lift up families, communities and our entire country.  With our unions, we have the power to transform lives for the better. A lot of people don’t understand that. Too many political pundits divide working people by race and class and a dozen other distinctions, but I’ve seen how collective bargaining can change all that and bring the most diverse people together around a common purpose.Our unions can and will transform lives… and unionism can and will transform America.As we stand together… as more Americans see us exercise our collective power… more people will be inspired to join us.Our job today, and every day heading into the midterm elections, is to turn our activism into real political power by continuing to build momentum for an independent and issue-based agenda for working people. We want… and we’re going to win... a new set of economic rules so regular people can get ahead.And after the election, we’re going to turn around and use our electoral momentum to win more organizing fights and win better contracts! We’re building a better America!That’s what President Trump promised us, but that’s not what he’s delivered. Instead of progress, we got a historic, budget-busting tax giveaway for multinational corporations, Wall Street and billionaires. Instead of new economic rules, we got repeated efforts to dynamite the Affordable Care Act, and as a result we’ve got rising out-of-pocket costs and unjustifiably high prescription drug prices, and we’re still staring down the barrel of a wholly unfair tax on middle class health care plans, which will only push prices for working people even higher.Instead of leveling the playing field for working people, we’ve endured rollbacks on Wall Street reform and a Supreme Court stacked against us… a Supreme Court that’s likely to side with the corporate right-wing in Janus any day now. That whole case from beginning to end is nothing more than a gross attempt by a dark web of anti-worker interests to attack the political power of unions.But let me tell you something. We will not fear the attacks against us. We won’t fear right to work. We won’t fear Janus. We won’t fear any of it. Our movement is bigger than our institutions. Our power comes from the connections between us. Our solidarity is bigger than any politician or judge or disgruntled public employee. It can’t be measured. It can’t be seen. But I can feel it, and I know you can, too.The corporate billionaires can’t touch our solidarity... . yet when they attack our institutions… when they attack our ability to fight for our members and our communities… when they attack our ability to harness political power for working people… we’ll fight back. We will fight back against every attack on working people, and we’ll fight hard… we’ll fight to win!As we fight… as we educate our members… as we campaign this summer and fall, we’ll spell out our independent worker agenda again and again. We don’t work for any political party. We work for workers, because we want more Republicans who will break rank and stand with working people. And while we’re at it, we want fewer Democrats who take our money and energy and then forget who got them elected in the first place.We want working family champions. Bold, fearless leaders who say “UNION” loud and proud, and not just on Labor Day.Today, we have too many politicians who think inequality is inevitable. They claim the free market will solve all of our problems. They worship at the altar of tax cuts. And they tell us we have no say over whether our job is outsourced or automated.Well, I’ve got news for them. The economy ain’t like the weather. It’s shaped by rules, which are set by the people we elect. We’re going to elect folks who will write new economic rules, so working people can choose unions without being terrified and terrorized. We want good trade, so Mexican trade unionists can lift pay there without being murdered and wages can rise here at home. We want Wall Street and corporations to pay their fair share of taxes, so every community in America can have world-class public schools, safe roads and bridges and clean drinking water. And we want technology to be used as a force for good, not greed.That’s not too much to ask. We want everybody to have access to the American Dream. We want regular people to be able to work hard and get ahead. We want fairness. We want dignity. We want health care when we need it and a secure retirement after decades of hard work.We’ll fight for it. We’ll stand for it. We’ll march for it. We’ll chant for it. We’ll rise in solidarity… real solidarity… where your picket line is my picket line, and my picket line is your picket line. We’ll join! We’ll fight! We’ll win! For you. For me. For every one of us and every worker in America!We’re living in a time of great political change, brothers and sisters. Let’s lead our country forward. Let’s continue to build an issue-based movement. Let’s keep talking to our members. Let’s fight for those who fight for us.The corporate right-wing is going all out for our blood, but take heart because America is hungry for unity. The road ahead is hard, but nothing… and I mean nothing in this world can beat working people standing together. We’re the most powerful force there is… when we’re organized, mobilized and primed to act.It’s time, brothers and sisters. Our opponents are rich and ruthless. They’ve rigged the rules. They’ve held down our pay. They’ve attacked our health care. They’ve tried to kill our pensions, destroy our jobs and leave us begging for scraps.

Well guess what? Their time is up. Unions are on the move. In every city and every state. Young and old. Black and white. Immigrant and native-born. Gay and straight. Rural and urban. Republican and Democrat. We organized 262,000 workers last year alone. And we’re just getting started.Our labor movement is ready. We’re spoiling for a fight. I say, bring it on! We've taken their best shot, and we're still standing. We’re fearless. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united.And you ain't seen nothing yet!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
226,Trumka to Florida AFL-CIO COPE Convention: Working People Can Make the Difference ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-florida-afl-cio-cope-convention-working-people-can-make-difference,6-10-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Florida AFL-CIO COPE Convention: 

Thank you! Florida, it’s good to be back!Thank you, Brother Mike [Williams]. For nine years now, you’ve been at the helm of a movement that continues to defy the odds. You’re leading the fight to win a better future for working people across the state of Florida. We’re all better for it, and I’m proud to call you my brother and my friend.Brothers and sisters, two years ago, I stood before you at a moment of unthinkable tragedy and unprecedented loss. The night before, a few miles from here, 49 people, mostly young, mostly queer and mostly Latino, were murdered at the Pulse nightclub in a cowardly act of violence.Through that heartbreak, I remembered what the great openly gay labor and civil rights leader Bayard Rustin once said: “To be afraid is to behave as if the truth were not true.”We in the labor movement are not afraid. We are united. We are determined.Because we know the truth: That we stand together. That we fight together. That the struggle for working people is one to secure justice for everyone—for the power to live our lives freely and fully. That we will never leave anyone behind.Solidarity. That’s the spirit of our movement. Unconditional. Uncompromising. And not just when the sun is shining. Solidarity means individual sacrifice to advance the common good.Solidarity has delivered us here, and it will drive us forward.Brothers and sisters, we need that solidarity now more than ever. The fight ahead of us has never been more important. And, we’ll only come out on top if we march ahead arm-in-arm.Along the way, we’ve gathered a few true allies. Senator Bill Nelson is one of them.He’s been a devoted advocate for working families, a tenacious defender of unions and an indispensable friend.He has dedicated a lifetime of service to his country, to Florida and to working people. And through his top position on the Senate Commerce Committee, he’s fighting for us on the issues that matter most every single day.And you know what else? He’s just a good guy! He may have spent six days in space, but he’s one of the most down-to-earth folks I’ve had the pleasure of working with.Let me tell you, we need Bill Nelson by our side for another six years. So please, send him back to Washington.And while you’re at it, send Rick Scott into retirement.That name has been a dark cloud over Tallahassee for nearly eight years. His legacy is nothing short of a vicious, union-bashing crusade against Florida families.20% of Floridians—one in five of your neighbors—are struggling to get by without health insurance. Yet, Scott refuses to expand Medicaid coverage to nearly a million working people.Almost half of Floridians are struggling to pay for basic necessities. Yet, Scott is content to watch them continue toiling under a meager minimum wage that doesn’t pay the bills or put food on the table.Teachers are placing themselves between their students and barrages of bullets. Yet, Scott is focused on dismantling their unions.And here’s what drives it home for me. Hundreds of Florida workers are dying on the job each year. Families are losing loved ones to preventable, unnecessary workplace hazards. Yet, Scott decided to gut the Department of Health.That’s Rick Scott’s record. Fewer rights for working people. Less money in your pocket. More dangerous workplaces. Open hostility to unions.Now, he wants to take that legacy to Washington.Brothers and sisters, are we going to let that happen?Hell no!Meanwhile, Rick Scott’s lackies are looking to carry on his destructive work in Tallahassee.Brothers and sisters, are we going to let that happen?Hell no!We’re going to rally around Bill Nelson. We’re going to reclaim the Governor’s Mansion for working people. And we’re going to secure the economic future that Floridians have earned through lifetimes of hard work.This is a time for driven leadership. Not more cookie cutter politicians whose positions on big issues change with the season. Marco Rubio was once a voice for comprehensive immigration reform. Now he backs the Trump approach. We have a word for people like him in Pennsylvania: jackass.We deserve honesty and compassion from our leaders. Not the federal inaction that has resulted in the deaths of nearly 5,000 fellow citizens in Puerto Rico.And we deserve fighters for working people. Someone who will call out Disney for allowing their employees to live in crushing poverty right here in Orlando. Someone who will fight for a day when working at the happiest place on earth means earning a living wage.

Brothers and sisters, something is happening in America. And it all comes down to one simple question: What kind of future are we going to build for ourselves?Quite frankly, I’ve never been more optimistic.Workers aren’t sitting quietly as the wealthy rig the rules of the economy we built. Our members are leading a revolution to demand what we’ve rightfully earned.We see it in the historic teacher strikes sweeping the country. We see it in the hundreds of thousands of workers forming and joining unions. We see it in the countless young people rejecting the status quo and seeking the rights that come with a union card.Union membership is up. Our popularity has been rising for years. It’s well over 60%, the highest in nearly two decades, and it’s even higher among young workers. 15,000 people just organized new unions in a single week.It’s up to you to take it from here.Now is the time! The wind is at our backs! We’re organizing, we’re marching, we’re voting, and you know what? We’re winning!From Pennsylvania to New Jersey to Wisconsin to Kentucky, we’re electing pro-worker candidates in every corner of the country.That’s what we can do when working people are riled up and ready to make lasting change. That’s what we can do when we take our energy to the campaign trail—when we unleash the power of the best union-run, member-to-member campaign we’ve ever seen.We’re ready to commit the resources it takes to win, here in Florida and around the nation. But, we can’t do it alone. You’ve gotta be ready to take the batton and run it across the finish line.I know you have the capacity to carry us this year. I’ve seen you do it before.After the Tea Party wave in 2010, things looked bleak. Right-wing, corporate interests swept into office, and Scott settled in with plenty of allies.But for years, time and again, working Floridians took action. You mobilized. You looked that challenge in the face and rallied together. And you know what happened?You won!You defended public-sector unions’ freedom to advocate in the halls of power.You defeated an outrageous plan to shutter the Florida Retirement System.You blocked the largest prison privatization proposal in American history.You protected the State Group Health Insurance program.You ensured that Project Labor Agreements would continue to protect working people on the job.YOU did that. You showed the corporate political establishment what we could do.So, what built those victories? What makes the difference in these fights?Brothers and sisters, the difference is made by the force and will of working people! That difference is made on a Sunday afternoon knocking doors. It’s made at a phone bank after a long day’s work. It’s made in a conversation with a friend on the job.That difference isn’t made in Washington. It’s made in Pensacola and Miami and Jacksonville and right here in Orlando. It’s made by working people giving what precious time and energy we have to build a brighter future.Are you ready to seize this moment?Working people can make the difference for candidates when it counts. We can make a difference when we fight FOR something.Brothers and sisters, that’s exactly what we’re doing.We’re fighting for something real. We’re fighting to lift up lives. We’re fighting for the transformation that comes with a collectively bargained contract. We’re fighting for solidarity. I know it. You know it. It’s like love. It can’t be fully measured. It has to be felt, and I want every worker in America to feel it, to feel the pride and power that comes with solidarity.We’re ready to make progress, brothers and sisters. Each election, each organizing drive, each legislative battle…will showcase our growing clout. Yet I believe you’ll see the impact of our momentum on an even broader level.When more union members fill the halls of power…when wages rise and inequality shrinks…when we have more pro-labor Republicans and fewer corporate-beholden Democrats…when a growing number of young people see the value of democracy and that we can and will change the rules of this economy…when we stop defining victory as not losing...and most of all...when more workers realize our own value and the power of solidarity…that’s when you’ll know unions are on the rise.That moment is here. I feel it in every union hall I visit and every picket line I stand on. I feel it when I talk to brave immigrants ready to come out of the shadows, working women who are saying enough is enough and LGBTQ people who refuse to be silenced by hate. I feel it in the working people—teachers and nurses, flight attendants and graduate workers, our brothers and sisters at Disney World—who are fighting to overturn a rigged system that has left them behind for decades. And I feel it here today.Let’s send a message to anyone who would deny us what’s rightfully ours...to Rick Scott...to every corporate-bought politician: We’re not going anywhere!Let’s send Bill Nelson back to Washington. Let’s send a friend of working people to Tallahassee. Brothers and sisters, the future of Florida is in your hands! Now it’s time to deliver!Because we’re the ones who wake America every single morning. We tuck her into bed at night. We build the cars, we fly the planes and make the roads. We lift the loads and ship the goods. We pour the molds. We connect our cities and the world. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We make America strong.We don’t duck and run. We don’t run and hide. We are the American labor movement, and we will not be denied!Thank you! God bless you! And God bless the work you do!

227,Trumka Addresses America's Future Labor Lawyers ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-addresses-americas-future-labor-lawyers,6-7-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the AFL-CIO Lawyers Coordinating Committee Minority Outreach Conference: Thank you, Jessica [Chu], for bringing us together, and it’s great to be with all of you. I’m glad to hear your stories, and I’m proud that our program here will be part of your professional biographies from this point forward.I’d like to start today by giving you an overview of the state of the labor movement in America, as well as the opportunities in front of us and the challenges we face.Something is happening in America… something great… something none of us have seen on a national scale in a long time. You’ve watched the news about teachers, who’ve been taking to the streets and to state capitals all over the country to demand more money for education. You may have read news stories about the rising popularity of labor unions. Well over 60% of the public wants labor unions to have a stronger role in American life and politics, and that number is rising.These are major developments, and they will have a profound and positive effect on this country, and on the institutions which are devoted to the well-being of working people. Here are three real-world consequences of that rising popularity. In the span of one week recently, 15,000 workers in a range of industries and jobs, from Harvard grad students to journalists to health care workers, voted to join unions.Second, last week 50,000 Culinary Workers in Las Vegas negotiated in a powerful move to win good pay and fair wages, and those workers proved that working people can stand strong… and win. That’s important, because in America too often the cult of business leads us to believe that CEOs and special interests hold all the cards and make all the decisions. We are showing that together, working people can shift the balance of power.And, lastly, the first group of Boeing workers in South Carolina voted to unionize by joining the Machinists last week. I don’t think any of us can overstate the importance of workers choosing to stand together in a state where everyone, from the governor on down, has been openly hostile to workers and unions with no regard for the law for as long as anyone can remember. Mark my words: Workers in the South are organizing, and it marks powerful progress for the American Dream.Yet none of us for a minute should think the road forward will be easy. President Trump’s Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch, threatens to cast the deciding vote against workers in Janus and tilt the Supreme Court further in favor of corporations, breaking with 40 years of commonsense precedent. And many of his picks for the lower courts are outrageous—people with no litigation experience who have made careers attacking voting rights and workers’ rights and LGBTQ rights.Congress has been willing to stack the deck against working people for years, and they’re still at it. Massive tax cuts for corporations. Health care repeal and rollbacks. Attacks on immigrants. The deregulation of Wall Street. The gutting of environmental protections, worker safety rules and a whole lot more.These have real-world effects. Corporations have used a rigged system to outsource jobs, hold down wages and make it harder to form a union. According to a recent study by the United Way, 51 million households don't earn enough to afford a budget that includes housing, food, child care, health care, transportation and a cell phone. That’s 43 percent of all homes in the United States.To win new economic rules, we’re embracing real political independence that gives no consideration to party, so our agenda leads our politics, not the other way around. That’s important, because we need working people to understand that our endorsements are based on a candidate’s positions and actions. To put it more plainly: if you support us, we will support you.As law students preparing to enter the job market, you have an opportunity to be at the forefront of this activism. Worker and civil rights. Income inequality. Corporate overreach. Discrimination. These issues are being debated in union halls, courtrooms and the public square. And we need dedicated and sharp legal minds to help make our case, guide us forward and win lasting progress.Regular working people… especially those on the margins... that’s who needs clear, strong and enforceable rules most. The rich and powerful can rest on their wealth. The rest of us rely on the rule of law, and the dedicated professionals who spend their lives defending it.With all that in mind, I hope this summer’s work is transformative for you. I can promise that our labor movement specifically and the progressive world more broadly needs you and all you bring to the table. Your ideas. Your energy. Everything.It’s impossible to know what one experience will impact you the most, but I can tell you from my own legal journey that the greatest thing I’ve gained is lifelong friends.So work hard. But don’t work too hard. Take some time to rest and recharge. Remember to laugh. Support one another. Down the road you’ll be glad you did. In a few years, you’ll be helping each other find jobs and solving complex legal questions together. You’ll be recruiting the next generation of law students to our labor movement. And you’ll be making our country stronger in the process. Just look at Jessica. She sat in your chair not too long ago.With that, I’d love to hear some of your questions and thoughts. Who wants to start?© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
228,Trumka: Advance Immigration Agenda for All Workers,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-advance-immigration-agenda-all-workers,5-21-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the following remarks at the AFL-CIO Immigration Policy and Politics Conference: Thank you, Brother Jim [Boland], for your kind words of introduction. Brothers and sisters, welcome to the House of Labor for this important conference. It’s wonderful to be gathered here together.Today, we have a simple purpose: to advance an immigration agenda for all workers. This agenda is something all of us must be able to advocate clearly to our friends, our coworkers and each other, because the attacks against working people come in many forms… and one of the most dangerous is the immoral idea that says some of us are more worthy of freedoms and protections than others.Often, when I talk on the subject of immigration, I tell the story of my family in the coal fields of Southwest Pennsylvania, about how my grandfather came to the United States from Italy and worked for years before he could bring over his wife and children… including my mother… to live together as a family. I am a product of the “chain migration” President Trump so often demagogues.I talk about my father’s father, who came here to escape poverty in Poland. Today, the immigration hardliners would question whether he brought enough merit to be allowed in.I talk about how the mine owners divided us in my hometown by language, nationality and religion… and how there was a dirty name for each and every one of us… how we were cheated and abused.   Yet I also make clear how we came together as members of the United Mine Workers of America, how we stood strong in solidarity despite our different accents and origins. We won good jobs through our unionism, and we helped lift an entire nation in the process. It was unity and strength in the face of fear and division. It was hope in the face of hate. It was the labor movement at our best.  Brothers and sisters, today the forces of fear and division are on the move. And their influence goes all the way to the top. So many of the policies being pushed by the Trump Administration are designed to weaken unions, lower wages and make our workplaces more dangerous. This is what happens when you gut labor and safety agencies, take freedom on the job from more than a million workers and make hunting down working people the primary focus of immigration officials and the Department of Justice.I want to share a few such examples today of what this means in worksites across the country.In Boston, an immigrant worker broke his leg falling from a ladder on a construction site. Turns out that the contractor didn’t have workers’ compensation insurance, and when he tried to file a claim, he was arrested by ICE. That makes every construction worker in Boston less safe, because the next guy will think twice before filing a claim.Last month, 100 people were arrested and detained in a workplace raid in a Tennessee packing plant. The raids are happening faster than activists can track them. In Wisconsin. California. Texas. North Carolina. Iowa. I could go on and on. These ICE raids are terrifying immigrant workers, which directly threatens our freedom to stand together and fight in unions for fair pay and treatment.After contributing to our economy and playing by the rules for decades, the Trump Administration has said tens of thousands of union members with Temporary Protected Status are no longer welcome here. He’s sending the same message to DREAMers, seeking to end protections that have produced broadly shared benefits in industries and communities around the country.You’re going to hear more detail from our panel of experts in a minute, but let me lay something out plain: when DREAMers won the legal right to live and work here, pay and benefits shot up. That’s not just good for them. It’s good for everyone who works alongside them. You see, that’s how it works: We all do better when we all do better.Unfortunately, what we’re seeing today is exactly the opposite. We all share in the suffering when policies put a target on the backs of workers.Nearly every policy this administration has pushed... from tax cuts for billionaires to the roll back of worker safety to the attacks on dignity and rights of immigrant workers… has further rigged the economic rules against us and in favor of the wealthy few.It is critical for working people to understand this dynamic.Over the past several years, the AFL-CIO has been engaging in a worker education program called Common Sense Economics. Some of you have no doubt taken the training, or given it, and its main purpose is to help people understand that the economy isn’t like the weather. It doesn’t simply happen to us. The decisions we make at the ballot affect the economy, because it is shaped and guided by the people we elect to public office.Here’s something that might surprise you. Economists, including UC Berkeley professor Michael Reich, tracked the effect of prejudice on pay and benefits. They’ve found, predictably, that it coincides with less money and fewer benefits for those being discriminated against. But they also found that discrimination against one group of workers leads to poorer economic outcomes for everyone else in the community.When the rich and powerful are able to divide us, all workers lose. When we stand together in unity… we all rise.We have to stand together in 2018. We cannot shy away from the immigration debate or cede a single inch of ground to our opponents. We are committed to having real conversations through our union member to member program about how these issues affect us all, and Common Sense Economics will be an important tool to do that.  We need workers to understand America’s broken immigration system puts downward pressure on pay and benefits for all of us. Our answer is to stand united, as a politically independent movement of working people, for an immigration agenda that lifts us up. That starts with a path to citizenship for the millions and millions of people who live and work here and are American in every way but on paper.But it doesn’t stop there. It’s time to reform captive work visa programs so they are based on actual industry needs and include full labor rights and fair wages for every single worker. We must end the enforcement overreach and provide explicit protections to workers who want to organize a union or have the courage to speak up about unsafe conditions. We must keep families together, offer safe harbor to refugees and open our doors to working people from all over the world who want nothing more than a better life, just like my family did.If we do it right, immigration reform will make jobs better for everyone, improve the health of our democracy and empower us to organize millions of workers into unions.Unity works. Unionism pays. Our worker-led immigration agenda will help us lift each other up, strengthen our communities and work with dignity. It will take all of us to finally build an immigration system that puts people first, so we’re going to roll up our sleeves and lead by example. It’s time to remind working families of the power of solidarity and the dangers of division.This is our time. This is our fight. We’re organized. We’re mobilized. We’re gearing up, and we’re ready to turn the tide! Together, we all do better. Thank you very much.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
229,"At Northern Kentucky University Labor-Management Conference, Trumka Looks to the Future",https://aflcio.org/speeches/northern-kentucky-university-labor-management-conference-trumka-looks-future,5-9-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Northern Kentucky University 36th Annual Labor-Management Conference: Good morning, everybody. It’s a pleasure to be here. And it’s great to see my friend Tom Buffenbarger again. Tom, your lifetime of commitment to America’s working families can be felt in every corner of this country. You are a constant force for unity and solidarity, and I can’t think of anyone better to help us chart a path forward.The topic of today’s conversation, America’s future workforce, is absolutely critical. And I very much look forward to hearing Nick’s (Pinchuk) insight and perspective.On Thursday, the AFL-CIO launched our Commission on the Future of Work and Unions. The commission was formed by a unanimous vote of our convention last fall, and we are charged with determining how best to build bargaining power and provide economic security for millions of Americans amidst massive changes in the workplace.At our kickoff event, we heard from labor leaders, academics, policy professionals, organizers and frontline workers, who are each shaping the future of work in their own unique way.And we asked ourselves two important questions:What happens to a system that becomes incapable of supplying a rising standard
	of living to its people?How will the products and benefits of technology be divided...and who will make that decision?We’re facing a moment of unprecedented change—both in its scale and its accelerating pace. It’s one of the defining challenges of our time. But more importantly, it’s one of the greatest opportunities we’ve ever been presented.We can grow our economy and strengthen our nation, boost productivity and create greater prosperity, raise wages and secure better, longer, healthier lives for everyone. But only if we make some key decisions, together, about what we want our future economy to look like.As labor and management, we should be heading into this crossroads together.Just as managers are invested in their success, workers have a stake in what we produce. We take pride in the products we build and the services we provide. Our labor is sacred, and it drives us every day.Business and labor may play different roles, but we share common goals.Each of us wants American companies to succeed. Each of us wants workers to be safe, satisfied and productive. Each of us want a future where everyone can enjoy the fulfillment that comes with a good job.Yet we simply cannot ignore what has happened over the past 40 years. When unions are pushed aside—when decisions about our future are kept behind closed doors—the system begins to crack. And the bonds that hold all of us together start to weaken. We’re seeing the consequences of that erosion today.The latest wave of technological disruption has coincided with a generation of bad policy choices. These policies have held down wages, skyrocketed inequality and made it harder to form a union. Temporary jobs, scheduling abuse, subcontracting and misclassified workers have become all too common. As a result, more and more young people have lowered their expectations of ever paying off student loans, buying a home or even landing a good job.Listen to this: A 2016 study from Harvard University showed that only 30 percent of millenials believe it’s essential to live in a democratic nation. It’s a startling statistic. I believe it reflects the simple truth that young people are becoming more disillusioned as they bear the brunt of our broken economy.Earlier I asked what happens to a system that becomes incapable of supplying a rising standard of living to its people. The Harvard study provides us a glimpse of the answer. A system unable to provide for its citizens will not endure.So we cannot have a complete discussion about the future of work without talking about the future of workers. And that means acknowledging what tomorrow’s working class will look like. By 2032, a majority of workers between the ages of 18 and 64 with less than a college degree will be people of color. They need to play a part in shaping what comes next.These decisions can’t and won’t be made in the board room or corner office alone. We know from firsthand experience that the single most effective tool for building an economy of shared prosperity is collective bargaining. Strong unions—our collective voices—must be a part of this conversation.When workers sit down across the table from our employers and bargain, we bring home higher wages, have greater access to health care and a pension and are more likely to be safe on the job. Most importantly, workers who bargain collectively have a voice, a say in the terms and conditions of work. As a result, we’re more invested in our work. As we put our blood, sweat and time into our jobs—we also share in the fruits of that labor. And that leads to more driven, satisfied and productive workers who are committed to helping businesses thrive. It’s a win-win.When we raise the bar for ourselves, non-union employers also raise pay and improve benefits to attract and keep the best people. We can use this upward pressure to demand a world where the gains from technology translate into better pay and working conditions for everyone, where being more productive means we can work less and live more, where artificial intelligence allows us to have better, safer and more interesting jobs.As a labor movement, we are focused on using our collective voice to bargain nothing less than a fair piece of the gains from innovation. If the benefits of technology are divided fairly, we can create a new era of broadly shared prosperity, one where working people get a chance to share in the enormous wealth we help create.Today we are in the midst of a Fourth Industrial Revolution. Automation. AI. Digitization. You name it.Let me be clear. The labor movement isn’t shying away from this change. We’re leading the way.From assembly lines to construction sites to Silicon Valley, we have always adapted to new workplace realities with pride, flexibility and unwavering commitment.Before the punch clock and the factory floor, there was the hand tool and the workshop. Before the hardhat, there was the artisan's apron. Before diesel and electricity, there was steam.Times changed. Our jobs changed. And unions changed with them, building a more prosperous nation and a stronger labor movement in the process.We aren't done yet. With each step forward, we're leading the way to an even healthier, safer and more prosperous society. Auto workers are designing and building nextgen automobiles that will save countless lives on the road. Digital journalists are transforming the newsroom by providing breaking coverage on cutting-edge platforms. Steelworkers are advocating for exoskeleton technology—to help workers avoid injuries on the job. Electrical workers are using virtual reality to train a new wave of apprentices, handing them tools that I couldn't have dreamed of when I first stepped foot in a union hall.We’re providing today’s workers with the skills they need for the jobs of tomorrow. We partner with employers, government agencies and local communities to provide training for new and returning workers. Between 60 and 70 percent of registered apprentices are in labor-affiliated programs, contributing more than $1.5 billion a year to the economy.Our presence is having its biggest impact in the building trades, where we take part in more than 1,600 joint labor-management apprenticeship training committees. But apprenticeship programs are helping transform sectors from manufacturing to hotels and restaurants. In all, we operate the largest training network outside the U.S. military.So we aren't just embracing the future of work. We're living it and pioneering it every single day.But our experience has also taught us that there is a right way and a wrong way to unleash new tools. Will we let the drivers of inequality pervert technology to foster greater economic injustice and social unrest? Or will we demand that technology improves lives and raises standards and wages across the board?Labor and management have an opportunity to come together to ensure technology is used for good, not greed. In many ways, we are like a railroad. Labor is one track. Management is the other. But we are both heading in the same direction. And if one track isn’t on firm footing, we’ve all got a big problem.Now listen, there are some in management who think negotiating with employees is beneath them. They bring a dismissive and often hostile attitude to the bargaining table. There are some on the union side who think it’s not the job of workers to make their employers profitable and that anything gained without a fight doesn’t constitute a win. They’re both wrong.I tell my union friends all the time—an unprofitable company does us no good. So we have an interest in helping our employers succeed. But we also must have the freedom to bargain for a share of that success. All we’re asking for is an equitable piece of the profits we help create.More and more, workers are putting aspiration above fear. We see it in the historic teacher strikes sweeping the country, including right here in Kentucky. We see it in the more than 14,000 workers who formed and joined unions in just a single week last month.Americans are overwhelmingly rejecting the idea that good jobs are impossible—now or in the future. They refuse to accept an economy where Amazon pockets massive tax breaks while its employees live off food stamps...or where Walmart's CEO earns nearly 1,200 times more than the company's median worker.Working together, labor and management have created the most prosperous nation in human history. We’ve lit our cities and mechanized our farms. We've piloted flights across oceans. We’ve built a transcontinental railroad and an interstate highway system. We’ve played in unforgettable Super Bowls and delivered Academy Award winning performances. And we've connected the world with a device you can fit in the palm of your hand.Technology is more ingrained into our work than ever before, whether it’s something as common as email or as complex as artificial intelligence. We embrace advances in technology and systems that allow us to do our jobs faster, better and safer. But we will not allow 21st century breakthroughs to be used as an excuse for 19th century labor practices.The future of work provides an unmatched opportunity for cooperation and collaboration, communication and compromise. We can harness technology to raise pay, make jobs safer and achieve real work-life balance. We can usher in a workforce of unprecedented skill and professionalism. We can use this moment in history to redefine the relationship between labor and management, joining in partnership to build an economy that works for all of us and saving our democracy in the process.Let that be our legacy. Thank you very much.

230,Trumka to Operating Engineers Convention: Building Is What the Labor Movement Does Best,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-operating-engineers-convention-building-what-labor-movement-does-best,5-8-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the 39th Convention of the International Union of Operating Engineers: Thank you, Brother Jim [Callahan], for that very kind introduction. Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. It is so good to be with you today. We love the Operating Engineers! Every skyline is a reminder of your incredible professionalism.And how about that video? What an inspiring tribute to the union members who have always been on the frontlines responding to natural disasters. Hurricanes. Fires. Floods. The list goes on.I am so proud of the 36 IUOE members who spent two weeks in Puerto Rico helping their fellow citizens. I only wish our government would show that same commitment and dedication.From Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria to the Northern California wildfires, union members answered the call.And we are ready to help America recover and rebuild.After all, building is what the labor movement does best.At the AFL-CIO convention in St. Louis this past fall, President Callahan led our resolution on infrastructure. He talked about the once in a lifetime opportunity we have in front of us. To build America. To grow the labor movement. To create good, high-paying, family-sustaining jobs.For years, we’ve heard a lot of talk about infrastructure. Democrats and Republicans all say they support it. Business and labor agrees.The American Society of Civil Engineers tells us that to bring our existing infrastructure up to acceptable standards, we need to invest $4.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Yet our current funding is more than $2 trillion short of that figure.To be globally competitive, we also must invest upwards of $2 trillion in the transportation, energy and communications technologies of the 21st century.Brothers and sisters, with the need so great and the support so broad, I have to ask: where the hell is the bill?On Monday, we’ll kick off the 6th annual National Infrastructure Week. Yet not once in those six years has Congress passed a major infrastructure package. The federal gas tax hasn’t been increased since 1993. Countries like China and Germany are running circles around us on infrastructure.Unfortunately, President Trump’s plan is just another Wall Street giveaway. It includes only a fraction of the public money needed to rebuild our infrastructure. It pits rural and urban communities against each other. And it forces privatization down our throats. All this from someone who claims to be “the builder president.”If the president wants to see what a builder looks like, he should take a look at this room.He should visit your incredible, state of the art, $150 million, 229-acre training facility.You see, the Operating Engineers are ready to build.The labor movement is ready to build.America’s businesses are ready to build.We want the best infrastructure in the world. Roads. Bridges. Rail. High speed internet. Water that doesn’t poison our citizens.It is time for our politicians to put up or shut up.Stop talking. Start digging.Let’s rebuild this country with union labor and Davis-Bacon.And let’s do it today!Infrastructure is one important area where the labor movement is leading with issues.I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: the economy is not like the weather.It doesn't just happen to us. The economy is nothing but a set of rules.Those rules are written by the men and women we elect.They decide the winners and the losers, and for nearly four decades, working people have gotten the short end of the stick.So how do we fix this rigged economy?The answer is simple: we rewrite the rules.And that means electing the right rulemakers.There is no denying it’s been an uphill battle.Brothers and sisters, we have many champions in the Democratic Party. And we have a few good friends in the Republican Party. Both have addressed your convention this week.But the truth is this.The number of Republicans who support us has gone down.And the number of Democrats who disappoint us has gone up.That's why the labor movement must be an independent political voice.Hope will be found within our movement, not inside the major political parties.So I have a clear message today.To those who stand with us and fight for us: thank you. We’ve got your back.To those who are using their office to hurt us: we are coming for you.And to those who have forgotten that labor helped get them elected in the first place: the hell with you.Your party label can’t protect you anymore. We’re standing with those who stand with us!Guess what? It’s working.In just the past few months, working family candidates have outperformed expectations and won races in Pennsylvania, Iowa, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Washington, New Jersey, Maine, Virginia and Alabama.The path to power runs through the American labor movement. That’s why our political independence is so important. That’s why we’re going to unleash the most dynamic member to member program in our history. And we need your help.We’ve got to keep organizing, keep mobilizing, keep educating, keep registering, keep marching, keep fighting and keep winning, because we want a new day and a new economy where working people can get ahead! Let’s do it!Our unionism…the passionate stand we take for ourselves, our communities and each other…has never been more important.Something is happening in America.A growing number of working people are recognizing that the best way to raise our own standing is by standing with the person next to us. Collective action is on the rise.262,000 new union members joined the labor movement in 2017. 3 out of 4 of those were under the age of 35.More than 14,000 workers have formed and joined unions in just the past few weeks. Flight attendants. Graduate assistants. Nurses. Journalists. Utility workers.Teachers are standing up, speaking out and walking out.In March, slot techs at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut voted to join IUOE Local 30. Welcome brothers and sisters!And speaking of Foxwoods, I want to thank you for all of your hard work to defeat the deceptively named Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act.I support tribal sovereignty. We all do.Here’s what I don’t support: corporations using tribal sovereignty as a cover to hurt the very people it's meant to protect.By defeating that bad bill, we preserved National Labor Relations Act protections for more than 600,000 workers on native lands.We’re proud of this victory. We will always stand up to any attack on our rights. Yet the truth is we’ve been on defense for too long. Corporate attacks on tribal labor rights. Right to work. Janus. You name it. It is time to go on offense. Let’s drop our shield and pick up two swords.America is ready. The popularity of unions has been rising for years. It’s well over 60%, the highest in nearly two decades, and it’s even higher among young workers. 75% of workers under 30 have a favorable view of unions, including 55% of young Republicans.A future of shared prosperity, of thriving unions and strong communities is ours to win.We demand universal health care. We demand real retirement security. We demand trade deals that raise wages and create jobs. We demand a path to citizenship for hard-working immigrants. We demand equal pay for women and an end to sexual harassment. We demand dignity, rights, respect and the freedom to form a union for every single worker.None of this will be easy.The forces of corporate greed are more powerful, organized and focused than anytime I can remember.Yet none of us should doubt…not for a second…about how this all ends.Every day, our union movement is growing stronger, because we’re fighting for something real. We’re fighting to lift up lives. We’re fighting for the transformation that comes with a collectively bargained contract. We’re fighting for solidarity. I know it. You know it. It’s like love. It can’t be fully measured. It has to be felt, and I want every worker in America to feel it, to feel the pride and power that comes with a union.We’re ready to make progress, brothers and sisters. Each election, each time someone signs a membership card, each legislative battle…all of it showcases our growing clout in politics and our economy. Yet I believe you’ll soon see the impact of our momentum on an even broader level.When more union members fill the halls of power…when wages rise and inequality shrinks…when we have more pro-labor Republicans and fewer corporate-beholden Democrats…when a growing number of young people see democracy as a way to change the rules of this economy…when we stop defining victory as not losing…and most of all…when more workers realize our own value…that’s when you’ll know unions are on the rise and the country is on the mend.That moment is here. I can feel it. I feel it in every union hall I visit and every picket line I stand on. I feel it in the wave of union organizing from coast to coast. And I feel it here today. The future is now.Never forget...NEVER FORGET...we’re the ones who wake America every single morning. We tuck her into bed at night. We hoist the steel and build the roads. We mine the coal and lift the loads. We survey the sites and pour the molds. We connect our cities and the world. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We make America strong.We don’t duck and run. We don’t run and hide. We are the American labor movement, and we will not be denied! Thank you. God bless you. God bless the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO.

231,Trumka Salutes 26th Annual NALC Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-salutes-26th-annual-nalc-stamp-out-hunger-food-drive,5-7-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the 26th Annual Letter Carriers’ Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive kickoff event:Brothers and sisters, I’m Rich Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. I’m thrilled, as always, to be here at NALC. Brother Brian (Renfroe), thank you and President (Fred) Rolando for your great leadership. I also want to thank the U.S. Postal Service, the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association, the United Way and all the sponsors of this life-saving event. I’m so proud to help kick off this unparalleled, nationwide act of compassion.It’s an ambitious undertaking—the largest one-day food drive in the world. Reaching more than 10,000 cities and towns in every corner of the country. Collecting 1.6 billion pounds of food for over a quarter-century.It’s a big job. And who better to get it done than an army of letter carriers?In all those years, “neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night” has ever stopped you from getting those precious donations into the hands of the families who need them.That’s what you do. That’s what you’ve always done. The U.S. Postal Service is in a league of its own; nobody does it better.  And once again, you find yourselves under attack from the forces of greed. They want to reduce mail delivery. They want to cut your benefits. They want to sell off the post office to the highest bidder. Brothers and sisters, hear me loud and hear me clear: we won’t let them! The postal service is too good and too important to let this happen. In a fight between big corporations and the National Association of Letter Carriers, I’ll take the NALC any day of the week. After all, you are a union of everyday heroes. You don’t just deliver the mail. You rescue people in harm's way. You counsel veterans suffering from PTSD. You are a friendly face to those in need. You treat the customers on your delivery route like family. And that’s what this food drive is all about. As a labor movement, we’re fighting for a day where no one in America goes hungry. But in the meantime, there is real urgency in delivering food to the families who need it most. On Saturday, you’ll be tackling that challenge head on.Block by block, door by door, you’ll put the power of working people joining together on full display. It’s a moving testament to our capacity to deliver the change we want for our families and our communities.  That power—that unity—has never been more important. In this moment, as working families face overwhelming challenges to our fundamental rights and dignities, we are making the difference. You see it in teachers marching for fair wages. You see it in the wave of young workers organizing and joining unions. And this weekend, we’re going to see it on doorsteps in every community in America.Brothers and sisters, I said this was an act of compassion...but it’s more than just a day of charity or goodwill. This is solidarity in action, a demonstration of the bonds tying working people together. Whether we’re defending the right to join a union or making sure each of our families has food on the table, we will always have each others’ backs.Thank you for what you’re doing. The AFL-CIO is honored to be standing right alongside you. Here’s to another great year.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
232,"Trumka: Technology Must Be Used for Good, Not Greed ",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-technology-must-be-used-good-not-greed,5-3-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the opening meeting of the Commission on the Future of Work and Unions: Good morning, everybody. It is my pleasure to welcome you to the first meeting of the AFL-CIO Commission on the Future of Work and Unions. I want to thank my partners, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler and Executive Vice President Tefere Gebre, along with our affiliate union presidents, who represent the broad sectors of the economy and will help guide this important work.We are also honored to be joined today by a number of labor leaders, academics, policy professionals, organizers and frontline workers who are shaping the future of work in their own unique way.Our mission is to build bargaining power and provide economic security for millions of Americans amidst massive changes in the workplace, and to make sure we as a movement are effectively organized and structured to get it done. This includes figuring out how to rally and organize workers in the fastest-growing sectors of a rapidly-changing economy.We can’t afford to sit back. No matter how far we’ve come, we can’t act like there isn’t more change ahead. It’s tempting to hang on to yesterday’s victories. We’ve certainly been guilty of resting on our laurels from time to time. But that only weakens our ability to shape what’s coming next. More than ever, it’s time to look squarely forward.Strong unions must be at the center of the debate. Shaping the future of work...making the economy fairer for everyone...is our domain.After all, this is not our first rodeo. Before the punch clock and the assembly line, there was the hand tool and the workshop. Before the hardhat, there was the artisan's apron. Before diesel and electricity, there was steam.Times changed. Our jobs changed. And we changed with them, building a more prosperous nation and a stronger labor movement in the process.We never stand still. Led by this commission, unions will continue to strengthen and evolve.Today, we are in the midst of another technological revolution. Automation. AI. Digitization. You name it.This latest disruption comes as a generation of bad policy choices have created an economy where many new industries have grown up with no unions at all. In their efforts to strip us of our rights and dignities, some corporations and politicians have baselessly attempted to erode the very idea of what it means to be an employee. Temporary jobs, scheduling abuse, subcontracting and misclassified workers have become all too common. As a result, more and more young people have lowered their expectations of ever paying off student loans, buying a home or even landing a good job.This threatens our country’s very foundation—the unwritten social contract that ties my fate to yours. A 2016 study from Harvard University showed that only 30 percent of millenials believe it’s essential to live in a democratic nation. It’s a startling statistic. I believe it reflects the simple truth that young people are becoming more disillusioned as they bear the brunt of our broken economy.Meanwhile, the same bad actors who wrote our broken economic rules want to use technology to sideline the forces of justice and fairness—those of us fighting for a robust economy that lifts up all working families. They say the invisible hand of the market will work things out. But we know better. Working people are yearning for the chance to reclaim our voice, and this is the moment to speak louder than ever before.Something is happening in America. Workers are asserting our own value. We are building a revolution of our own. We see it in the historic teacher strikes sweeping the country. We see it in the more than 14,000 workers who formed and joined unions in just a single week last month. We see it in the countless young people seeking the rights and dignities that come with a voice on the job.It’s this passion that will strengthen and drive us as we face the dramatic changes that lie ahead. From assembly lines to construction sites to Silicon Valley, we have always adapted to new workplace realities with pride, flexibility and unwavering commitment.We aren't done yet. With each step forward, we're leading the way to an even healthier, safer and more prosperous society. Auto workers are designing and building nextgen automobiles that will save countless lives on the road. Digital journalists are transforming the newsroom by providing breaking coverage on cutting-edge platforms. Electrical workers are using virtual reality to train a new wave of apprentices, handing them tools that I couldn't have dreamed of when I first stepped foot in a union hall. Listen to this: Steelworkers are advocating for exoskeleton technology—to help workers avoid injuries on the job. We aren't just embracing the future of work. We're living it and pioneering it every single day.

But our experience has also taught us that there is a right way and a wrong way to unleash new tools. Will we let the drivers of inequality pervert technology to foster greater economic injustice and social unrest? Or will we demand that technology improves lives and raises standards and wages across the board? This commission believes technology must be used for good, not greed.We can demand a world where the gains from technology translate into better pay and working conditions for everyone, where being more productive means we can work less and live more, where artificial intelligence allows us to have better, safer and more interesting jobs. Above all, automation should mean even greater prosperity for us to share in. And therein lies the key to this entire discussion.As a labor movement, we are focused on using our collective voice to bargain nothing less than a fair piece of the gains from innovation. If the benefits of technology are divided fairly, we can create a new era of broadly shared prosperity, one where working people get a chance to share in the enormous wealth we help create. That’s not a new idea—it’s the foundation of a radical experiment that fostered the strongest economy the world has ever known.

Let’s build that economy once again.

Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
233,Trumka: Workplace Deaths a 'National Crisis',https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-workplace-deaths-national-crisis,4-26-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks on a press call discussing the federation's annual Death on the Job report: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss something urgent and heartbreaking that’s happening in our country.Each year on Workers Memorial Day—which we’ll recognize this Saturday—working people throughout the world remember those who were hurt or killed on the job and renew our struggle for safe workplaces.We’ve made great progress since key job safety laws were passed more than four decades ago. That didn’t happen on its own. It happened because workers and our unions organized, fought and demanded action from our employers and our government. It was working people, through our unions, who demanded and won stronger standards to protect us from dangers in the workplace.But now, that progress is under siege. And, this year’s Death on the Job report gives some alarming insight into what’s happening.Not a day goes by in Washington where these isn’t a new controversy. Our divided politics tell us everything has two sides—and sometimes more.

But one thing that shouldn’t raise a fight: the health and safety of working people. The idea that we have a right to return safe and sound after a full day’s work. There’s no gray area there, no nuance.

Quite frankly, greed kills. And every day, decisions are being made in boardrooms and the halls of power—by CEOs and their handpicked politicians—to prioritize wealth and self-enrichment over the health and safety of the men and women who made that wealth possible.

Too often, our constitutional, God-given right to life is being tossed aside for a few extra bucks in the pockets of the richest and most powerful people in this country.

And, we’re seeing very real consequences in the workplace.

5,190 American workers died from injuries on the job in 2016, hundreds more than the year before. Another 50,000 to 60,000 died from occupational diseases. All together, that means about 150 workers died each day from preventable, hazardous workplace conditions.Some of the most vulnerable working people are bearing the brunt of this travesty. Latino and immigrant workers continue to account for a disproportionate number of deaths on the job.And here’s a scary reality: violence is now the second-leading cause of workplace death, accounting for 866 deaths in 2016—including 500 homicides. And, women are disproportionately the victims.I wish we had time to tell the stories of every brother and sister we’ve lost this year. Because numbers alone do not do them justice. They lived and laughed and loved. And they deserved better from their country.My point is this: we’re facing a national crisis. And, it’s time that folks in this town start acting like it.But instead of launching a massive campaign to reduce workplace injuries and deaths, the Trump administration is gutting the protections already on the books.Here’s just one case that really gets me. The administration is considering rolling back MSHA’s coal dust rule at the request of mining executives. Well, NIOSH just reported the largest cluster of black lung in coal miners that we’ve seen in years...My dad died of black lung in 1999. Since then, 9,000 miners have been taken away from their loved ones the same way. Even as we’re being warned that more miners are at risk today, as with so many things under this administration, corporate greed is taking the front seat.It’s shameful. It’s unacceptable. And the labor movement is going to use our pro-worker, independent political voice to stop it.Now, I’d like to pass things over to Peg Seminario, who directs the AFL-CIO’s work on occupational safety and health. Thank you.   © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
234,"Trumka to Boilermakers: More Than 10,000 Working People Formed and Joined Unions Last Week",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-boilermakers-more-10000-working-people-formed-and-joined-unions-last-week,4-23-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers Legislative Conference: 

Thank you, Brother Newton [Jones], for your generous words of welcome, and for your leadership of this great union. As a Penn State fan, this is the only time I’m happy to be in a room full of Boilermakers.As I begin, I want to congratulate you on your 50th legislative conference! Go ahead, give yourselves a round of applause!Brothers and sisters, the Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers stand for excellence, for high standards, safety, unity and for an unmatched commitment to training.Those qualities make a powerful union, especially when we stand together as one big independent pro-worker political movement. We want to win a new set of economic rules to benefit regular working people, ALL working people, because we refuse to simply survive. We want our unions to thrive!During this legislative conference, and during your time on Capitol Hill, I want you to think about the critical choices we face as a movement. You’ll be advocating for the WAGE Act, which would finally put real penalties on employers who break the law in order to deny us a voice on the job. You’ll be defending the Jones Act, which has been subject to baseless political attacks for decades. You’ll be demanding that Congress repeals… ONCE AND FOR ALL… the unfair tax on our health plans. And you’ll be calling for the energy, defense and infrastructure spending our nation desperately needs. This is not a Republican or Democratic agenda. It’s labor’s agenda. And our agenda leads our politics, not the other way around.So I have a clear message today.To those who stand with us and fight for us: thank you. We’ve got your back.To those who are using their office to hurt us: we are coming for you.And to those who have forgotten that labor helped get them elected in the first place: the hell with you.Your party label can’t protect you anymore. We’re standing with those who stand with us!Our political independence was on full display during the most recent special election in Pennsylvania.Conor Lamb faced an uphill battle. Donald Trump had won the 18th Congressional District by more than 20 points. So Lamb came to us. He met with our leaders. He spoke in our union halls. He wore his support for our issues on his sleeve. And we turned out for him.Labor made up 25 percent of the electorate. Lamb carried our households with over 60 percent. And the final margin of victory was just 755 votes.That’s how Conor Lamb won . It’s a loud wake-up call for anyone hoping to do the same in 2018—and yes, 2020. Earning the support of working people is a high bar. It’s more than a handshake or a photo-op. And it extends well beyond the campaign trail.

Union members used our passion and resources to help elect candidate Lamb. Now we are going to use that same energy to hold Congressman Lamb accountable in office. Winning elections is only the first step. Winning pro-worker policies is the ultimate goal.

Working people proved that we will move heaven and earth to help a genuine ally. But we won’t waste a dime or a door knock on fair weather friends. If you want working people to rally around you, then you sure as hell better rally around us.

And it’s not just Pennsylvania. Working family candidates have outperformed expectations and won races in Iowa, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Washington, New Jersey, Maine, Virginia and Alabama, and that’s just the past few months.We want every candidate to understand that the path to power runs through the American labor movement, brothers and sisters. That’s why our political independence is so important. That’s why we’re going to unleash the most dynamic member to member program in our history. That’s why we’ve got to keep organizing, keep mobilizing, keep educating, keep registering, keep marching, keep fighting and keep winning, because we want a new day and a new economy where people can work hard and get ahead! And we’ll do it! With the Boilermakers leading the way!Our unionism… the passionate stand we take for ourselves, our communities and each other… has never been more important. We are the best organized voice for working people in America.

Yet the truth is we’ve been on defense for too long. Right to work. Janus. The attacks on federal employees. You name it. It is time to go on offense. Let’s drop our shield and pick up two swords.We were able to make progress in the recent omnibus budget deal, securing some money to put Boilermakers to work. But we need more. Much more. And we can start by demanding investments to create good American jobs in clean energy as we pursue trillions of dollars in investments for the best infrastructure in the world.It’s also time to update the National Labor Relations Act to protect ALL workers… union, non-union and never-heard-of-union. I already mentioned the WAGE Act. We also want to protect and expand retirement security with the Butch-Lewis Act, and we oppose any and all schemes that put our pensions at risk. People should be able to look forward to a secure, dignified retirement after a lifetime of work. Anything else is simply unacceptable.To win the investments we need, America needs a fair tax system. Last Tuesday was Tax Day. As a result of President Trump’s bogus new law, working people footed the bill for over $1 trillion in giveaways to the rich and powerful. Not only does the new tax law provide corporations even more money to ship American jobs overseas… it gives the richest 1 percent a $33,000 tax cut while low-wage workers get just $40. Imagine that: billionaires get a new car, while the working poor gets a tank of gas.We demand better, brothers and sisters. We demand universal health care. We demand real retirement security. We demand trade deals that raise wages and create jobs.  We demand citizenship for immigrants. We demand equal pay for women and an end to sexual harassment. We demand dignity, rights, respect and a union for every worker—in construction and manufacturing, shipbuilding and railroads—in all the industries you represent.Let’s show working people we can win, brothers and sisters! Let’s deliver the change America needs. It’ll take risk. It’ll take solidarity, but we can make it happen by standing together, marching together, fighting together…shoulder to shoulder…arm in arm…as long as it takes. To take America back! For workers! For the country we love! For each other!When I talk about workers, I’m talking about our members, our friends, our family—people like my dad, and my uncles. I’m talking about folks like Cheryl Brouwer, a sixth-grade teacher in Oklahoma. Cheryl joined a walkout that closed schools statewide for more than a week. She did it to demand better pay and more school funding, so her students would have textbooks published in this century. She did it because she loves her work. That’s the same reason teachers walked out in Kentucky, Arizona and West Virginia, and I was so proud and happy when those teachers won.This is a special moment in American history, brothers and sisters. I am proud to report to you today that more than 10,000 working people formed and joined unions last week. That’s right, I said WEEK! And guess what? We’re just getting started.

Solidarity is our strength. Think about it. The popularity of unions has been rising for years. It’s well over 60%, the highest in nearly two decades, and it’s even higher among young workers. Listen to this: 75% of workers under 30 have a favorable view of unions, including 55% of young Republicans.

A future of shared prosperity, of thriving unions and strong communities is ours to win.

Don’t for a moment think it’ll be easy. The forces of corporate greed are more powerful, organized and focused than anytime I can remember.

Yet none of us should doubt…not for a second…about how this all ends. Our movement is coming back, and we’re coming back strong!

This is our time. Every day, our union movement is growing stronger, because we’re fighting for something real. We’re fighting to lift up lives. We’re fighting for the transformation that comes with a collectively bargained contract. We’re fighting for solidarity. I know it. You know it. It’s like love. It can’t be fully measured. It has to be felt, and I want every worker in America to feel it, to feel the pride and power that comes with a union.

We’re ready to make progress, brothers and sisters. Each election, each time someone signs a membership card, each legislative battle…all of it showcases our growing clout in politics and our economy. Yet I believe you’ll soon see the impact of our momentum on an even broader level.

When more union members fill the halls of power…when wages rise and inequality shrinks…when we have more pro-labor Republicans and fewer corporate-beholden Democrats…when a growing number of young people see the value of democracy and know we can and will change the rules of this economy…when we stop defining victory as not losing…and most of all…when more workers realize our own value…that’s when you’ll know unions are on the rise.

That moment is close. I can feel it. I feel it in every union hall I visit and every picket line I stand on. I feel it when I talk to brave immigrants ready to come out of the shadows and working women who are saying enough is enough. And I feel it here today.

Never forget. We’re the ones who wake America every single morning. We tuck her into bed at night. We build the ships and make the roads. We lift the loads. We pour the molds. We connect our cities and the world. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We make America strong.We don’t duck and run. We don’t run and hide. We are the American labor movement, and we will not be denied! Thank you. God bless you. God bless the work you do! Have a wonderful convention!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
235,Trumka to Air Traffic Controllers: We are Building a More Perfect Union,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-air-traffic-controllers-we-are-building-more-perfect-union,4-20-2018,"Thank you, Brother Paul [Rinaldi], for your kind words of welcome, and for your leadership of the Air Traffic Controllers. Just this week, a few miles from here, we were reminded of the bravery each of you demonstrates, when a Southwest jet flying from New York to Dallas lost its engine and was forced to make an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport. Audio of the call between the pilot and air traffic control demonstrated once again the calm, steady hand guiding us home every single day. We owe so much to our air traffic controllers. I'm so proud and honored to be here at your convention. You are American heroes.Today’s theme is “Building a More Perfect Union.” Just over a decade ago, Barack Obama gave a speech here in Philadelphia, and it bore the same title. At the time, a controversy had erupted about the inflammatory comments of Obama’s pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Obama, in the midst of a presidential campaign, had a choice to make. He could let the moment pass and hope the controversy would eventually die out. Instead, he decided to confront the issue head on. What followed was one of the greatest speeches in American history. Obama addressed the importance of unity in America. The man who went on to become our 44th president spoke of embracing and understanding our past without letting it define our future. He talked about binding our hopes together with the larger aspirations of all Americans. “Let us be our brother’s keeper,” he  said. “Let us be our sister’s keeper. Let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well.” As a labor movement, we face our own critical choice. Will we let corporations continue to write the economic rules...or will we reclaim the economy for those of us who work? Will we be defined by red states and blue states...or will we lead with a robust pro-worker agenda that transcends partisan politics? Will we tap into the inspiring wave of worker activism sweeping our nation...or will we be content to simply protect what we have?Brothers and sisters, we cannot let this moment pass. We will not let this moment pass. We can build a more perfect union by building a bigger and stronger labor movement. The Air Traffic Controllers are showing us the way forward. Your organizing is second to none. You have always put issues first. You are focused on electing leaders who will help us win progress, no matter their party.  Just look at our recent victory in the western part of this state. Conor Lamb faced an uphill battle. Donald Trump had won the 18th Congressional District by more than 20 points. So Conor Lamb came to us. He met with our leaders. He spoke in our union halls. He wore his support for our issues on his sleeve. And we turned out for him.Labor made up 25 percent of the electorate. Lamb carried our households with over 60 percent. And the final margin of victory was just 755 votes. That’s how Conor Lamb won . It’s a loud wake-up call for anyone hoping to do the same in 2018—and yes, 2020.

Let’s drop our shield and pick up two swords. And let’s start by demanding the best infrastructure in the world.It’s time for stable and predictable long-term funding for the FAA and for broad upgrades to the air traffic control system. That means full staffing, new technology and a commitment to modernization. Let’s do it. Enough delays. Enough excuses. Let’s invest the trillions of dollars it’ll take to rebuild this country. To pay for what we need, America needs a fair tax system. Tuesday was Tax Day.

Let’s deliver the change America needs. It’ll take risk. It’ll take blood and sweat, but we can make it happen through solidarity—by standing together, marching together, fighting together… shoulder to shoulder…arm in arm…as long as it takes.

236,Trumka Accepts Youth Champion Award From Mikva Challenge,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-accepts-youth-champion-award-mikva-challenge,4-18-2018,"Thank you, Jack [Marco], for your introduction and for this award. You, Robyn [Lingo] and Brian [Brady] are doing unparalleled work engaging students with our democracy.

And above all, thank you, Shelina [Warren], for what you do every day. We honor the hard work and sacrifice of every educator and public school worker tasked with raising the next generation of Americans. You’re shaping our future, in too many ways to count.

We’re living in a profound moment of change. And lately, it’s teachers who’ve captured our country’s imagination. We’ve seen uprisings in unexpected places like West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Arizona. These patriotic Americans are standing, marching and fighting for the dignity that they’ve earned.

They’re demanding something that’s been wrongly denied them for years and in many cases, decades. Working people from ALL industries and communities want a fair return on our work.

It’s a tough fight against some very powerful, well-funded interests. For too long, the economic rules have been deliberately written to keep corporations strong and working people at bay.  When our economy is rigged against those who make it work, it is only natural that cynicism starts to take hold.Listen to this.

A Harvard University study found that only 30 percent of millennials believe it’s essential to live in a democracy...30 percent. Can you believe that?

So this battle over teacher pay and public education is in fact something much bigger.It’s a fight for the future of our democracy.The American idea that anything is possible if you work hard and play by the rules is simply not true for those coming of age today.Young people have seen their democracy produce a society that is unequal and, too often, wholly unfair. So they’re doing their part to change that.

It’s always been the next generation pushing us forward—asking the hard questions and challenging the status quo. The further they push and the more they achieve, the greater their confidence will grow in our system of government. And that's good for everyone.

I experienced it firsthand. When I was 19, I headed into the coal mines for the first time. And I soon discovered that union leaders were stifling the voices of union members. At that time, you couldn’t see your own contract. If you thought you had an issue, you’d be told, “No. You’ll have an issue when I tell you you have an issue.”It was a recipe for corruption, and all the ills that go along with it.So I joined a movement called Miners for Democracy. It was us—the teenagers and 20-somethings—demanding change. We made the union our own again—democratic and member-driven. We stood up and won the future we deserved.Today’s generation of young leaders is doing exactly that. There’s been marches here in Washington and around the world.A wave of millenials are standing up for their own economic rights and forming unions.Students are demanding safe schools and freedom from debt. Young workers are speaking out for good jobs, fair wages, universal health care and paid time off.Collective action is on the rise in America. And it’s the best thing to happen to our democracy in a very long time.So here’s my one ask: keep it up.

Keep demanding better.

Keep leading the way.

Keep standing up.

Keep speaking out.

Keep raising your hand.

Keep raising your voice.

Keep up the fight.

And no matter what: Keep on keepin' on!

The labor movement will be here to support you every step of the way.

Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
237,Trumka: Hilda Solis Put The 'Labor' Back in Labor Department,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-hilda-solis-put-labor-back-labor-department,4-17-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the portrait unveiling for former Labor Secretary Hilda Solis: Thank you, Jane (Oates), for that kind introduction and for the outstanding work you did at the Employment and Training Administration. I also want to thank Secretary Acosta and all the hard-working employees of the Department of Labor for hosting us today. It is an honor to be here to celebrate my friend and sister Hilda Solis.When Frances Perkins was asked why she accepted FDR’s offer to become America’s first female cabinet secretary, she said and I quote: “The door might not be opened to a woman again for a long, long time, and I had a kind of duty to other women to walk in and sit down on the chair that was offered, and so establish the right of others...to sit in the high seats.""More than 75 years after Perkins made history, Hilda Solis didn’t just sit in that high seat...she stood. And every single worker grew stronger because of it.Shortly after Hilda was confirmed in 2009, she visited our AFL-CIO Executive Council and boldly proclaimed: “There’s a new sheriff in town.” She didn’t let us down.Following years of neglect, President Obama pledged to return the DOL to its fundamental mission of protecting and providing economic opportunity and security for American workers.With that unmistakable mandate, Hilda assembled a stellar team of dedicated public servants to lead the Department’s most important agencies.She personally stood shoulder to shoulder with workers and their families during a wave of disasters, both natural and manmade, including the Great Recession, the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion, the BP Oil spill and Superstorm Sandy.She sought and won significant new funding for worker protection, adding hundreds of job safety inspectors at OSHA and MSHA.She launched a new enforcement initiative aimed at employers who misclassify workers as independent contractors, with vast new recordkeeping rules to expose misclassification.She expanded the Labor Department’s programs and initiatives to reach and protect the most vulnerable workers, including Latino and immigrant workers.And she repealed a Bush-era executive order requiring government contractors to put up a poster informing workers of their right NOT to join a union...and replaced it with a requirement that contractors post a message telling workers they DO have the right to form and join unions.With that subtle change, Hilda sent a resounding message to America’s working people: the days of union-busting at the Department of Labor were over. We were proud to present her a giant copy of the pro-worker poster signed by all of our union leaders.Last month marked 107 years since the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, which killed 146 workers, mostly young women. Frances Perkins happened to be there that day, witnessing the horror of women and girls throwing themselves out of windows to escape the flames. That moment changed her. And it was a driving force behind her lifelong pursuit of justice for working people.Similarly, Hilda Solis has always leaned on life experience to shape her career in public service, including her current job as L.A. County Supervisor. She is the daughter of immigrant parents who met in citizenship class. Her father was a shop steward with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. She was the first in her family to go to college. Hilda knows what it’s like to struggle and scrap and persevere. Hers is an American Dream story. And she’s never stopped fighting to extend that dream to others.In the end, Hilda Solis put the labor back in Labor Department. We are forever grateful for her service and solidarity. Thank you. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
238,Trumka to Pennsylvania AFL-CIO: We Hold the Keys to Victory,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-pennsylvania-afl-cio-we-hold-keys-victory,4-11-2018,"Brothers and sisters, it’s great to be home in Pennsylvania!Thank you, Brother Rick [Bloomingdale], for inviting me, and for your powerful and inspired leadership. Thank you, Brother Frank [Snyder], for your toughness and energy and all you do. Thank you to the entire Pennsylvania AFL-CIO for your fighting spirit and for your victories!If you want to know the power of unions here in Pennsylvania, I have two words for you: Conor Lamb. That’s right, brothers and sisters. Working people and the power of a union-run, member-to-member campaign are what carried the 18th Congressional District.Conor Lamb shared our agenda and spoke out for our members. He talked about the importance of the labor movement everywhere he went.

He didn’t hijack our message to advance his own interests or to help corporate donors. He embraced our fight to secure economic justice and lifelong dignity for all working people. He didn’t just ask for our support. He earned it.

Working people noticed, and we showed up in droves to mobilize our union brothers and sisters.

We knocked on doors, made calls and sat down with members at their worksites. We talked to teachers and municipal employees in suburban Allegheny County, steelworkers in the small towns of Washington County and coal miners in the rural stretches of Greene County. From the headquarters of the state federation to the packed field offices of our CLCs, working people put our blood and sweat into this campaign.

In a district where 20% of folks heading to the polls were union voters, that effort made the difference. We knocked on the doors of more than 34,000 union households and made more than 48,000 calls. Person by person, we mobilized a grassroots movement.That’s how Conor Lamb won . It’s a loud wake-up call for anyone hoping to do the same in 2018—and yes, 2020. Earning the support of working people is a high bar. It’s more than a handshake or a photo-op. And it extends well beyond the campaign trail.Union members used our passion and resources to help elect Conor Lamb. Now we are going to use that same energy to hold him accountable in office. Winning elections is only the first step. Winning pro-worker policies is the ultimate goal.Working people proved that we will move heaven and earth to help a genuine ally. But we won’t waste a dime or a door knock on fair weather friends. If you want working people to rally around you, then you sure as hell better rally around us.Democrats, don’t go crawling to Wall Street. They don’t hold the keys to victory—we do!Come to us. Talk with us. Rise with us. March with us. Stand with us. Fight with us, and win with us!We extend the same invitation to Republicans. We don’t work for any political party. We want fair economic rules so working people can work hard and get ahead, and we will gladly go to bat for any Republican who goes to bat for us.That’s our political independence on parade, because, when it’s all said and done, our electoral and legislative work comes back to one simple thing, just like our workplace organizing and contract fights. We want working family wins. Period.Brothers and sisters, I don’t think I need to remind you that America’s labor movement sprang up out of the coal mines, the steel mills and the rail yards of Pennsylvania generations ago. Our ancestors bled and died for our freedom to stand together in strong unions, and to negotiate for a better life. We will honor them by walking that same path.Listen close: America’s labor movement is on the rise once again. We won’t be held down, pushed back or shoved aside. Conor Lamb was just the tip of the iceberg. Our popularity is the highest it’s been in nearly two decades. We organized 262,000 new union members last year. Teachers are walking out. Working people are speaking out. Momentum is on our side. Let’s make 2018 the year of the worker. COME ON! LET’S DO IT! This is our time. This is our day. This is our moment. Union proud. Union strong. Unions forever!Our work has never been more important. We are the last, the only and the best organized voice for working people in America.And it is time for us to go on offense.Working people need progress. We want a good job for everyone in America who wants to work. That means the freedom to bargain with your employer for a fair wage and a good life.And it means technology must be a tool for broadly shared prosperity, not more corporate greed.I know this convention is focusing on the future of work. We’re not shying away from the challenge of automation. Think of the wheel. The loom. The internal engine. The assembly line. The computer. The internet. We embrace change. But we are also using our voice to make sure workers don’t get left behind.The truth is, brothers and sisters, working people have been innovators since the very beginning. Our mandate is not to slow progress, but to make it work for us. We can demand a world where the gains from technology translate into better pay and better working conditions for everyone and where working hard doesn't mean exhausting yourself to the edge of illness or even death.And speaking of healthier lives, we're going to continue the fight for universal health care. We should be expanding Medicare to cover everyone 55 and older. We should rein in the power and influence of drug companies. And we should repeal the tax on union health plans once and for all.

We also want retirement security. Real retirement security!  Let’s expand Social Security and protect our pensions. Bigger and better, brothers and sisters.

We want the best infrastructure in the world. Roads. Bridges. Rail. High speed internet. Clean drinkable water in every faucet. Let’s invest the trillions of dollars it’ll take to rebuild this country. And let’s do it with union labor and prevailing wages.

We want a fair tax system. I’m not talking about President Trump’s bogus new tax law that provides corporations even more incentives to ship American jobs overseas… that gives the richest 1 percent a $33,000 tax cut while leaving just $40 for those with the least. Imagine that: billionaires get a new car, while the working poor gets a tank of gas.Is that fair? No! We are demanding a tax structure where Wall Street and the wealthy few actually start paying their fair share.We want a new direction on trade. Over the past several weeks, there’s been a lot of discussion around tariffs. I want to be clear about what tariffs ARE and what they AREN’T.

Tariffs ARE a common sense tool to enforce trade rules. Tariffs ARE a standard way to hold trade cheaters accountable. Tariffs can level the playing field for America’s producers and workers.

Tariffs AREN’T a trade war. When global companies exploit workers and deny labor rights, that’s a trade war. When these same corporations overproduce steel and dump it onto the world market to kill American jobs, that’s a trade war.

Wall Street has been waging war on our families and communities for decades. Brothers and sisters, we’re not going to take it anymore! That’s why we killed the TPP. That’s why we’re working nonstop to fix NAFTA. That’s why we support effective trade enforcement. And that’s why we're going to end the era of corporate trade once and for all!

Last but not least, we are standing up for immigrant workers. I was disgusted by President Trump’s Easter Sunday tweet saying he would no longer support a path forward for Dreamers. In the words of Pope Francis: “Having doubts and fears is not a sin. The sin is to allow these fears to determine our responses, to limit our choices, to compromise respect and generosity, to feed hostility and rejection.” For too long, this president and his allies have compromised respect and fed hostility for political gain. It has to stop.These are our brothers and sisters. I am sick and tired of the political games. I am sick and tired of employers cheating, exploiting and misclassifying immigrant workers. What hurts you hurts me. What’s lifts me up lifts you up. Let’s give immigrants a path to citizenship so we can all rise together as one American family.Let’s show working people we can win, brothers and sisters! Let’s deliver the change America is hungry for. It’ll take some risk. It’ll take solidarity, but we can make it happen by standing together, marching together, fighting together… shoulder to shoulder… arm in arm… as long as it takes. To take America back! For workers! For the country we love! For each other!Four years ago, here in Pittsburgh, I sat with a fresh gubernatorial candidate and a bunch of workers who wanted unions. Today, those workers have contracts on the job, and that candidate is Governor Tom Wolf. That is no coincidence. Workers get ahead when our friends hold office. Tom has delivered for working families again and again.And look at Sen. Bob Casey. He has been a powerful voice for working people in the United States Senate. His door is always open, but that’s not all. He seeks our advice constantly. Just the other day, he came to the offices of the AFL-CIO in Washington to make sure he got the views of working people on the key issues that affect us most. That’s friendship. That’s respect. That’s political power.Every day, our union movement is growing more politically independent. It’s not about party. It’s about workers, and we’ve got pro-worker, pro-union Republicans here in Pennsylvania. We are proud to have their support.When I talk about workers, I’m talking about people like my dad, and my uncles and your members throughout this great state. I’m talking about folks like UMWA member Dwayne Thomas from Local 1248. Brother Dwayne led by example. He knocked doors. He worked the phone banks, and he helped bring home that crucial win for Conor Lamb. Thank you, Brother Dwayne! And thank you to every local union, every affiliate, every member, every retiree and every family member member and friend who came together under the banner of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO to show America that the path to power runs through our labor movement.We’re fighting for something real. We’re fighting to lift up lives. We’re fighting for the transformation that comes with a collectively bargained contract. We’re fighting for solidarity. I know it. You know it. It’s like love. It can’t be fully measured. It has to be felt, and I want every worker in America to feel it, to feel the pride and power that comes with solidarity.We’re ready to make progress, brothers and sisters. Each election, each organizing drive, each legislative battle… will showcase our growing clout. Yet I believe you’ll see the impact of our momentum on an even broader level.

When more union members fill the halls of power…when wages rise and inequality shrinks…when we have more pro-labor Republicans and fewer corporate-beholden Democrats…when a growing number of young people see the value of democracy and that we can and will change the rules of this economy…when we stop defining victory as not losing...and most of all...when more workers realize our own value and the power of solidarity…that’s when you’ll know unions are on the rise.

That moment is close. I can feel it coming. I feel it in every union hall I visit and every picket line I stand on. I feel it when I talk to brave immigrants ready to come out of the shadows and working women who are saying enough is enough. I feel it in the teachers from West Virginia and Kentucky to Oklahoma and Arizona, who are fighting to overturn a rigged system that has left them behind for decades. And I feel it here today.Never forget that we’re the ones who wake America every single morning. We tuck her into bed at night. We build the cars, we fly the planes and make the roads. We lift the loads and ship the goods. We pour the molds. We connect our cities and the world. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. We make America strong.We don’t duck and run. We don’t run and hide. We are the American labor movement, and we will not be denied! Thank you. God bless you. God bless the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
239,Shuler: Collective Action is Alive and Well in the South ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-collective-action-alive-and-well-south,4-10-2018,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler delivered the following opening remarks at the Southern District Strategy Session:

Thank you, Dr. (Louis) Reine, for that kind introduction. And thanks to UA Local 60 for hosting us today. Good morning, everybody. It’s great to see all the union power in this room!I want to reinforce what Belinda said about our Code of Conduct. We simply will not tolerate any form of harassment, discrimination or bullying. If you experience or see something, please report it to one of the designees.For months, we’ve witnessed the bravery of working people across industries, occupations, identities and genders come forward to tell their stories and make visible the pervasiveness of sexual harassment. This is a watershed moment and I can’t think of a better group to chart the way forward than the labor movement.Our goal for today’s meeting is to unite around a common purpose and strategy to win back power for workers. Over the next several hours, we’ll look at ways to neutralize Janus and right to work by organizing internally. We’ll dive into our Path to Power program with Charlie Wowkanech of the New Jersey AFL-CIO whose labor candidate school has inspired a nationwide push to elect union members to office. We’ll discuss the ways we are using data and technology to break new ground in politics AND organizing. And we’ll lay out our Labor 2018 program, with a focus on talking to our members about issues.At the AFL-CIO convention in St. Louis in October, I talked about the labor movement reaching a tipping point, where just focusing on protecting what we have is far more dangerous than taking risks.So today we are going to focus on ways our unions can accelerate change, be bold and meet the challenges of our time.I want to touch on four key areas where we can make that impact.The first is politics. We simply can no longer afford to support candidates based solely on their party registration. You understand this better than anyone here in the South. For too long, Republicans have attacked us...Democrats have ignored us...and true worker champions have been few and far between. But we are starting to change that.As a labor movement, we are putting issues first. Good jobs. The freedom to form a union. Health care for all. Retirement security. Paid time off. Workplace safety. immigration reform. Equal pay. These are popular across the political spectrum.If you embrace labor’s agenda, we will use our organizing capacity to help get you elected. We saw the power of our electoral program in the most recent special election in Pennsylvania. But Conor Lamb wasn’t the first to ride a union wave to victory. We did it for Ralph Northam in Virginia. We did it for Doug Jones in Alabama. We did it for Linda Belcher in Kentucky and Braxton Winston in Charlotte. And we’re ready to do it throughout the South this fall.Improving the lives of union members and all working people must be our guiding light in politics. And as Charlie will explain later, there is simply no substitute for electing one of our own.The second way we can make an impact is by shaping the future of work. Sometimes the future is presented as a ""new"" discussion. But the fact is workers and unions have been adapting to the changing nature of work throughout our history. We embrace innovation and cutting edge advancements that improve products, services and lives. But we do not accept a model of change that leaves workers behind.At the AFL-CIO Convention in October, delegates unanimously voted to form an AFL-CIO Commission on the Future of Work and Unions. Our commission is focused on the urgency of this moment and committed to the powerful principle that the economy of the future should be fueled by good jobs, real bargaining power and strong unions.   But we aren’t just talking to ourselves. We’re taking our message on the road and talking with CEOs, tech companies and financial institutions about why workers must be at the center of this conversation. In a few weeks, I will be back here in New Orleans at Collision…a tech conference...to share our vision and experience with thousands of employers.The third way we can make an impact is by building a more diverse labor movement. We know the stats. By 2055, non-whites will be a majority in America. We know that a collective bargaining agreement is the best tool for achieving justice for ALL working people—but with 90 percent of America not in unions, we have to make our case directly to those who would benefit most from collective bargaining.For example, women are half the workforce, and will be half the union movement in less than 8 years. Today is Equal Pay Day, which means women have to work all the way until April 10 to earn what men did in the previous year. Let’s show working women that a union is the best way to achieve equal pay, paid time off, family leave and protection from sexual harassment. And while we’re at it, let’s move more women into the leadership of our unions.Young people need better jobs and less debt—we can be on the front lines of the college affordability debate and push for more resources for apprenticeship and training to show we’re a path forward for them.People of color want upward mobility and a justice system that doesn't discriminate...immigrants need a path to citizenship and protection from deportation...LGBTQ want to stop being fired and bullied because of who they are...let’s show them all that unions are the answer!And that brings me to the final way we can have an impact: making unions relevant to people’s daily lives. Today, we’ll talk about Janus and the other attacks on our rights. Of course, we are fighting back.  We’re mobilizing our members, arguing our case before the Supreme Court and recommitting to organizing.But we must also use these attacks to demonstrate our value…through industry-leading contracts...through cutting edge training and education that helps workers ladder up to better job…through the actions we take to improve communities, like responding to natural disasters, helping immigrants win citizenship and stopping sexual harassment.If we demonstrate value, we become essential. And right to work becomes irrelevant, because workers will want to join us.The labor movement has been demonstrating our value here in the South under the most difficult political and economic conditions. All twelve states in this region are right to work. Yet time and again, unions are overcoming the odds and showing the true power of solidarity.Here in New Orleans, workers at the city’s largest hotel formed a union with UNITE HERE.Across the border in Arkansas, we had an increase of 15,000 union members in 2017. Did you hear that Walmart?In Tennessee, the labor movement stopped a corporate-backed effort to privatize maintenance and management at most state-run facilities.Teachers in Oklahoma and Kentucky are walking out to demand higher salaries and more school funding.And workers at Disney World rejected the company’s low-ball contract offer and continue to stand together for better pay and working conditions.Whether it’s organizing in the Carolinas, taking political action in Virginia and Georgia or bargaining the best contracts in Alabama and Mississippi, collective action is alive and well here in the South.Last week, I had the privilege of traveling to Memphis for AFSCME’s “I AM 2018” campaign marking the 50th anniversary of Dr. King’s assassination.Being there was a reminder of how far we’ve come and the work still left to be done.  To finish the job started by the Memphis sanitation workers and lifted up by Dr. King and others, we must be willing to take risks and embrace change.That’s what this moment demands. That’s what we are committed to doing. That’s what this meeting is all about. Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
240,"Trumka to Midwest District Meeting: ""We can choose to do better."" ",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-midwest-district-meeting-we-can-choose-do-better,3-13-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following closing remarks at the Midwest District Meeting: 

Thank you, brothers and sisters.

This has been a very productive meeting. We covered a lot of ground.

We talked about the political landscape, the need to increase our density and the ways we can use the 2018 election to engage with our members.

We talked about the Workers’ Bill of Rights and our Path to Power program which is helping elect more union members to office.

We talked about the threats of Janus and right to work and our capacity to overcome them.I am confident that we will leave here today with a clear vision and mission for growing our movement and winning worker power.

This has never been more important.

We are the only organized voice for working people in America.

And momentum is on our side!

260,000 new union members joined our ranks in 2017 despite a very difficult organizing environment.Three quarters of new union members are under the age of 34. The future is bright!

As we gain density, we gain power. As we grow in numbers, we grow in influence. That’s how we start to build the America working people need.I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Our economy is nothing more than a set of rules. Those rules are written by the men and women we elect. They decide the winners and the losers. For too long, those rules have been written to enrich corporations at our expense. But here is the good news: we can choose to do better. And that’s exactly what we’re doing.

Brothers and sisters, we’ve been on defense for too long. It is time to go on offense. Let’s drop our shield and pick up two swords.

We want a good job for everyone in America who wants to work. That means the freedom to bargain with your employer for a fair wage and a good life.

We want health care as a fundamental human right.

We should be expanding Medicare to cover everyone 55 and older. We should rein in the power and influence of drug companies. And we should repeal the tax on union health plans once and for all.

We want retirement security. Real retirement security!  Let’s expand Social Security and protect our pensions. Bigger and better, brothers and sisters.

We want the best infrastructure in the world. Roads. Bridges. Rail. High speed internet. Clean drinkable water in every faucet. Let’s invest the trillions of dollars it’ll take to rebuild this country. And let’s do it with union labor and prevailing wages.We want a fair tax system. Unfortunately, President Trump’s new tax law gives away $1.5 trillion to the country's richest and most powerful corporate interests and gives companies even more incentives to ship American jobs overseas.And speaking of outsourcing, we want a new direction on trade that upholds labor rights and ends special privileges for corporations.

In recent days, there’s been a lot of discussion around tariffs. Let’s talk about what tariffs ARE and what they AREN’T.

Tariffs ARE a common sense mechanism for trade enforcement. Tariffs ARE the way to hold trade cheaters and bad actors accountable. Tariffs ARE a tool that can level the playing field for American producers and workers.

Tariffs AREN’T a trade war. When global companies exploit workers and deny labor rights, that’s a trade war. When these same corporations overproduce steel to drive U.S. companies out of business, that’s a trade war.Wall Street has been waging war on our families and communities for decades. Brothers and sisters, we’re not going to take it anymore! That’s why we killed the TPP. That’s why we support  effective trade enforcement. And that’s why we're going to end the era of corporate trade once and for all.Last but not least, we need to stop terrorizing immigrant workers. These are our brothers and sisters. I am sick and tired of the political games. I am sick and tired of employers cheating, exploiting and misclassifying immigrant workers. What hurts you hurts me. What’s lifts me up lifts you up. Let’s give immigrants a path to citizenship so we can all rise together as one American family.These issues are the backbone of our political program. We are committed to electing leaders who share our values and support our issues, regardless of what party they belong to. And we’re going to hold every single one of them accountable once elected. This will help us build the political strength and credibility to shape public policy. And we know the best way to advance our agenda is to elect more union members to office.

Working people are ready to turn the tide, go on offense and win.We’re going to repeal right to work in Missouri. We’re going to defeat Governor Rauner here in Illinois. We’re going to lift up dynamic young leaders like Kooper Caraway, the 27-year old president of the Sioux Falls, South Dakota Central Labor Council. We’re going to build on cutting edge campaigns that raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour in Minneapolis and secured paid sick leave in St. Paul. We’re going to learn from our experience in Iowa and use it to confront Janus with passion and determination. And we’re going to fight each and every day to win a fair shot and a fair shake.Let’s show working people we can win! Let’s deliver the change America is hungry for. It’ll take some risk. It’ll take solidarity, but we can make it happen by standing together, marching together, fighting together… shoulder to shoulder… arm in arm… as long as it takes… let’s do it! To take America back! For workers! For the country we love! Thank you very much!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
241,Trumka Defines Victory for Working People at Midwest District Meeting,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-defines-victory-working-people-midwest-district-meeting,3-13-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following opening remarks at the Midwest District Meeting: 

Thank you, Brother Mike (Carrigan). And thank you all for being here.

As I begin, I want to reinforce what Katie said about our Code of Conduct. We simply will not tolerate any form of harassment, discrimination or bullying. If you experience or see something, report it to one of the designees.

Today in this room we have the best trade unionists in the Midwest region. You are the labor movement’s eyes and ears. Every role and every job is represented here today. It is not an exaggeration to say the future of our movement and our country is in your hands.In October, we gathered in St. Louis for the national AFL-CIO convention. We left that important event with a bold vision for the future. And we adopted a comprehensive policy agenda focused on rewriting the rules of our economy so working people can fairly share in the wealth we help create.To realize that vision and win that agenda, we need to execute the basics. I can tell you from my football coaching days that the best teams are sound in the trenches. They block well and they tackle well. For us, that means engaging with our members on issues. It means organizing inside and outside of our unions. It means forming alliances with community partners. And it means holding our elected officials accountable, no matter what party they happen to belong to.Our goal for this meeting is to unite around a common purpose and strategy to win back power for workers. Over the next several hours, we’ll look at ways to neutralize Janus and right to work by organizing internally. We’ll dive into our Path to Power program which is electing union members to office from coast to coast. We’ll discuss the ways we are using data and technology to break new ground in politics AND organizing. And we’ll lay out our Labor 2018 program, with a focus on talking to our members about issues.Let me be clear. We will aim to defeat every attack on either the institutions of our labor movement or the core values we hold dear—freedom, equality, justice, fairness and the rights to assemble and speak freely.

We will use every fight to educate our members about the threats we face and more importantly, our power to overcome them.And we will do the hard work of rebuilding the American Dream for everyone who calls this country home.That’s exactly what’s happening here in the Midwest region.When anti-worker legislators passed right to work in Missouri, you didn’t sulk. You pounded the pavement, collecting more than three times the signatures necessary to put that law on the ballot this fall. And come November 6, we’re going to put right to work where it belongs…in the trash.In Iowa, the enemies of labor passed a sweeping law requiring public sector unions to hold recertification elections before negotiating new contracts. In response, The New Republic ran a headline saying: “Republicans Are Set to Destroy Iowa’s Labor Unions.” Well, guess what? They didn’t destroy us. Over 93% of Iowa public sector bargaining units were recertified.

And here in Chicago, when hospitality workers faced an epidemic of sexual harassment, the Chicago Federation of Labor and UNITE HERE Local 1 launched a massive campaign called “Hands Off, Pants On,” winning a citywide ordinance mandating that housekeepers receive panic buttons so they can alert hotel security when they feel threatened. Last night, I had the privilege of spending some time with workers from Local 1. It was a vivid reminder that we are a movement of heroes.The test of 2018…and beyond…will be to build on these successes. Each election, each organizing drive, each legislative battle…will showcase our growing clout. But I believe you’ll see our impact on an even broader level.

When more union members fill the halls of power…when wages go up and inequality shrinks…when we have more pro-labor Republicans and fewer corporate-beholden Democrats…when a growing number of young people see the value of democracy…when we stop defining victory as simply not losing...and most of all...when more workers realize their own value and power…that’s when you’ll know unions are on the rise.That moment is close. I feel it in every union hall I visit and every picket line I stand on. I feel it when I talk to brave immigrants ready to come out of the shadows and working women who are saying enough is enough. I feel it in the West Virginia teachers who courageously went out on strike and won a 5 percent raise for ALL state employees. And I feel it here today.We are the only ones who can deliver the massive economic and social change working people are hungry for.That’s what we’re going to do.That’s what this meeting is all about.So let’s get to work.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

242,Trumka Reflects on Pro-Worker Ministry of Pope Francis,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-reflects-pro-worker-ministry-pope-francis,3-6-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at Seton Hall University commemorating the fifth anniversary of the papacy of Pope Francis: Good evening. I am deeply honored to be here at Seton Hall University. I want to first express my personal gratitude to President [Dr. Mary] Meehan for hosting this event and for her kind words, and to Cardinal [Joseph] Tobin for his invitation to join him on this stage to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Papacy of our Holy Father, Pope Francis. Finally, I want to thank the new governor of this great state, Phil Murphy, for joining us tonight. I look forward to hearing your thoughts in a moment.This event is only possible because of the work and devotion of many, many people. I want to recognize in particular my dear friends and brothers Charlie Wowkanech, president of the New Jersey AFL-CIO, Mario Cilento, president of the New York AFL-CIO and Vinny Alvarez, president of the New York City Central Labor Council. Thank you.We are here tonight to reflect on the meaning of the Papacy of our Holy Father Pope Francis, and in particular the meaning of his ministry for regular working people. We have just heard from Cardinal Tobin some of the context for Pope Francis’ ministry in the long legacy of the Catholic Church’s support for the labor movement in the United States and around the world—a legacy that continues to be written every day in settings as far removed as the chambers of the Supreme Court and the grim cells of immigrant detention centers.Five years ago, Pope Francis was elected to the Papacy. From his first moments as Pope, he ministered to a world deeply hurt by the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath—where it seemed at every turn working people paid the price for unmitigated greed on Wall Street. Pope Francis came to Rome from South America to preach to a world in which many millions had been fundamentally marginalized and forgotten—facing the loss of jobs, the foreclosure of homes, the burdens of sickness and old age without adequate security and the trauma of homelessness. The people of the global south suffered the most endemic and desperate situations...extreme poverty and total exclusion from the fabric of society. In his every act, Pope Francis extended an elegant and simple message: “You are not alone.”The title of tonight’s event is “Solidarity is OUR word.” Those are the words of our Holy Father. I believe that statement is both traditional and revolutionary.Frankly, I use the word “traditional,” because solidarity is the core message of Catholic social teaching and has been for generations. This is the Catholicism I learned as an altar boy in my hometown of Nemacolin, Pennsylvania. This Catholicism was our shield as poor immigrant coal miners. That may sound like colorful language, but it is the literal truth. When my dad and granddad were organizing the United Mine Workers, the mining company owned the entire town we lived in. They forbade anyone to organize a union on their land. This edict was enforced by Pennsylvania’s dreaded Coal and Iron Police. One night those men on horseback came upon my dad and my grandad at a secret union meeting in the woods. They beat the coal miners with clubs, looking to crack skulls. My dad and granddad ran to the only building in Nemacolin that was not owned by the mine bosses, Our Lady of Consolation Catholic Church. The mounted police chased and caught them just as they reached the church. The iron shoes of the horses clattered onto the church steps, and the Coal and Iron police struck my grandfather across the eyes. He carried the scar for the rest of his life. The great wooden door of the church opened, and Father Simko ran out with a crucifix high above his head and said: “This is the Lord’s house! This is a sanctuary!”Brothers and sisters, the Catholic Church has always ministered to working people, sheltered working people...inspired, soothed and lifted up working people...and from that deep tradition rises the ministry of Pope Francis.Yet in the context of our cold and impersonal modern world, in which so many politicians and business leaders seem to worship the invisible hand of the market—the Pope’s message of solidarity is revolutionary, even destabilizing.All around us people are appealing to our worst selves, baiting us to fear and hate anyone who seems on the surface to be different. Voices sowing division and distrust tell us to admire the thief, the con man, the bully and to look down on humble workers...nurses, teachers, ironworkers and sheriff’s deputies. When Pope Francis says solidarity is our word, his message contradicts the morality adopted by so many of the world’s wealthy and powerful. His message is an affront to selfishness. It breaks isolation. It welcomes the outcast. It exposes the illusion and reveals the truth, which is that we are bound together by love, and we must care for each other and our world.Last week, we saw the ugly forces of greed and division manifest themselves at the Supreme Court. The labor movement is profoundly grateful to the Conference of Catholic Bishops for filing an amicus brief in the Janus case on behalf of the freedom of public sector workers to form effective unions. At stake is whether public workers will have a fair and free vehicle to carry out Pope Francis’ message of solidarity. Will the federal courts in the age of Trump allow working people to have the precious freedom to form effective unions? Or will the Supreme Court, too, try to fragment us, to leave even more of us at the mercy of—as our Holy Father says—“an economy that kills?”The core of Pope Francis’ ministry for working people is love. He tells us we matter. Our work and our lives count. Our sacrifices for our families, for our fellow workers, for our vision of a better world are worthwhile, and ennoble our lives. He shows us how the ties that bind us together do not make us foolish or weak, but rather connect us to the divine.Pope Francis also challenges us. His ministry is not a pat on the head. He demands that those who uphold and follow the modern ideology of greed—rich and working people alike—stop and ask: Is this worthy of what God made us to be? The words of Pope Francis force us to ask ourselves: What is the nature of solidarity? He asks if our ethic of love is consistent. He asks: Can our devotion to human life allow the rollback of environmental regulations and worker protections that boost profit but literally kill the poor?What is our relationship, our Holy Father asks, with other working people, with our poor neighbors both close to us and far away? What is our relationship to the Earth itself? Who do we exclude?Now, I want to address in detail three themes of Pope Francis’ ministry. The first is how work connects with what it means to lead a good life. The second is his critique of neoliberalism from the perspective of solidarity. The third is what Pope Francis says to working people and to our labor movement about what we must be—and how to be true to the spirit of solidarity.In this whole talk, my hope is to reinforce the words of Cardinal Tobin. This is not some high-minded philosophical discussion. Pope Francis offers practical answers to tough challenges faced by working people and our unions in the United States and around the world.Last November, Pope Francis wrote a letter to a global conference of labor leaders at the Vatican about work. My friend Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, a part of the UFCW, who is here tonight, attended and spoke at that conference. In his letter Pope Francis said: “According to Christian tradition, (work) is more than a mere doing; it is, above all, a mission....We collaborate with the creative work of God when, through our work, we cultivate and preserve creation; we participate, in the Spirit of Jesus, in his redemptive mission, when by our activity we give sustenance to our families and respond to the needs of our neighbor.” Pope Francis then quoted St. Ambrose who said: “Every worker is the hand of Christ who continues to create and to do good.”This message rises from the ancient doctrines of the Catholic Church. It also speaks to the lived experience of every worker I have ever known. Coal miners. Strawberry pickers. Nursing assistants who clean bedpans. Graduate assistants who teach in universities. All express pride in the ability to “create and to do good.” Work gives our lives meaning. As we work alongside each other, our shared experiences and values bring us together in solidarity. Early in his papacy, Pope Francis said: ""We do not get dignity from power or money or culture. We get dignity from work.""Pope Francis’ message about the value of work clashes with what we’re told by some of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful people, who say our society hurtles toward a future in which there will be no work at all. Pope Francis tells us not only is such a world a fantasy, it is a nightmare.You see, no form of labor is shameful. I think of Rebecca Diamond, a second-grade teacher in West Virginia, who recently went on strike out of desperation. “I never dreamed 19 years ago when I started teaching that I would have to work a second job to provide for my kids,” she said. Our labor movement will fight and pray for Rebecca and her fellow educators. Work is never shameful. What is shameful is how we are treated by too many of those who employ us, and by so many politicians who claim to speak for us.As we speak of the dignity of work, we must address the injustices that women face. Pope Francis has spoken of ""chauvinism that always wants to control the woman,” calling unequal pay ""a disgrace.""All work has inherent dignity, yet for far too many the workplace is a setting of dangerous vulnerability. Pope Francis challenges all of us to ask ourselves: What part do we play in the vulnerability of others?When I hear Pope Francis speak of the dignity of work, I also think of my family’s history as coal miners in Pennsylvania. My grandfather entered the coal mines when the job was a sure ticket to an early grave—if the roof falls didn’t get you the Black Lung would. What you got for sacrificing your life to the mine was poverty. My granddad, my dad and my uncles fought to make those jobs better, just like they fought for our country in World War II. In the 1960s, when I first went underground, mining had become much safer, and it paid a middle class wage. What had changed? The coal was the same. Yes, the technology of mining had improved. Yet what really changed was the workers who dug the coal had come together and formed a union the bosses could not ignore. With our union, we leveled the playing field. That’s how we made our lives and communities better, as we made those mines more productive.And so today, we are told, technology will do away with the work of millions of us. We are told that somehow, despite the world’s rapidly growing material wealth, our society will no longer be able to afford for us to work, to be dignified by our labor. It’s a ridiculous idea. People will always work. And technology should improve our working lives, not impoverish or degrade us. Pope Francis tells us that God values work, not robots. God values people who work, and God expects us to do the same.Pope Francis’ love for work and workers is the heart of his challenge to neoliberalism, to the false and destructive idea that we should allow unregulated markets and greed to dictate what happens in our global society. He has received both positive attention and criticism over his critique of unfettered capitalism.In his first major statement, Pope Francis exposed—and I quote—the “forms of neoliberalism that consider profit and the laws of the market as absolute parameters above the dignity of people or peoples.”With these words, Pope Francis called out the all-too-common notion that our value can be reduced to a dollar figure. This actually happens. Here’s an example. A few years ago, managers at a profitable Mott’s apple juice plant in upstate New York tried to cut worker pay, saying they were—quote—“a commodity like soybeans or oil.” This was at the end of the Great Recession when millions of workers had lost their jobs. No. A surplus does not drive down our value. We are not commodities, traded by the bushel on some unregulated exchange. We are people. The Mott’s workers, members of RWDSU, rallied, went on strike...and with President Appelbaum by their side, won.The quote I gave you just a moment ago from Pope Francis about neoliberalism was offered in the aftermath of the Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh, where 1,134 garment workers died. As working people reckoned with the scale of easily preventable loss after that terrible day, we...in the global labor movement...asked the world’s largest brands and retailers to require their suppliers to, at the very least, meet minimal standards for worker safety and labor rights. The workers at Rana Plaza had been sounding the alarm about the building for years, with no result. In answer to our demands, hundreds of global brands signed a binding agreement to improve working conditions, but many major U.S. brands and retailers, led by Walmart, did not.The example of Pope Francis teaches us that market fundamentalism cannot be reconciled either with the dignity of labor or with our fundamental dignity as people. Pope Francis teaches us it is simply immoral to harm other people in the name of the free market. When businesspeople hide behind complex and faulty economic arguments, it is wrong. A “market transaction” does not allow us to escape our moral responsibility. It doesn’t work. We are all children of God.Recently, Pope Francis said: “The capitalism of our time does not understand the value of trade unions, because it has forgotten the social nature of economy, of business.”This goes back to his message about the need for our economies to respect human dignity.Yet the Holy Father does not let workers off the hook. He challenges us, and we MUST respond. He has said to us that we in the labor movement must embrace prophecy and innovation. In his address to Italian unions, Pope Francis said—and again I quote: “Unions are an expression of the prophetic profile of society. Unions are born and reborn each time that, like the biblical prophets, they give a voice to those who have none, denounce those who would ‘sell the needy for a pair of sandals’ (cf. Amos 2:6), unmask the powerful who trample the rights of the most vulnerable workers, defend the cause of foreigners, the least, the rejected.”Let me talk about a situation today, in the United States, that calls on the labor movement to embrace our prophetic mission. Disturbingly, our government is seeking to rip from homes and communities hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled terrible injustice in decades past to find sanctuary here, who have lived and worked here, who have raised families and built careers right here under a program known as Temporary Protected Status. These are our neighbors, our friends...this is us. Tens of thousands of union members are part of the TPS program, which may soon end. And at the same time our government may soon uproot, detain and deport hundreds of thousands of young people known as DREAMers—aspiring Americans who came to this country as small children and know no other home.We love and value these people, and our sympathy extends, also, to the parents of these DREAMers, the mothers and fathers who sought a better life, a place to care for themselves and their families, a refuge from disaster and persecution. We must not expel those who trusted our offer of help, and we must replace our broken immigration system built of capricious and punitive laws with one that offers all who work in America a path to citizenship.We care about ALL these good people. We must. Our solidarity MUST extend to each and every one of our brothers and sisters. Pope Francis reminds us that our fate as a labor movement, our strength and our solidarity grows from our choice to be reborn in the defense of our neediest brothers and sisters.Pope Francis makes a larger point, too. He says: “Unions do not carry out their essential function of social innovation if they watch over only those who are inside, if they protect the rights of only those who already work or who are retired. This must be done, but it is half of your work. Your vocation is also to protect those who do not yet have rights, those who are excluded from work and who are also excluded from rights and from democracy.”Today only one in ten of America’s workers has the ability to bargain collectively with our employers through a union. Yet our labor movement defends the other nine workers every day. We defend Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and Workers Compensation. We defend the freedom to vote against those who would take this nation back to the days of Jim Crow. We fight every day for a tax system where corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share so we can invest in the programs working people need.It is not enough. Pope Francis urges us on. His message could not be clearer—a prophetic and innovative labor movement must seek to give voice to all workers, and not just voice. Listen to the words of our Holy Father. He speaks of “denouncing those who would sell the needy for a pair of sandals.” He speaks of unmasking the powerful. This is the language of power, not of power for its own sake but power in the service of others, especially the poor, the marginalized and the excluded. Our solidarity...our unionism...must and will be the antithesis of social exclusion.I believe America’s workers and our unions are prepared to respond to this challenge from Pope Francis to be both prophetic and innovative. And we take strength from the Church’s solidarity with us. I think of Puerto Rico—where hundreds of union members from New Jersey and New York risked their own lives to help the poor and the devastated in Puerto Rico this past fall. When our relief flight arrived in San Juan, our people were met by the Archbishop of San Juan, Roberto Gonzalez, who came late at night to our barracks and walked the halls handing out bottles of water and blessing and praying with construction workers and nurses.The labor movement is resolved to fight for and win collective bargaining for all of America’s workers, because, like Pope Francis, we believe the poor must be the agents of their own development. The future of humanity does not belong to the elites and the powerful, but to all of us and our ability to organize for a fair piece of the pie. We will defend our democracy against those who urge us to hate and fear, and who say greed will answer our need. It will not and cannot. And we will see to it that the gains of technology are shared among all.I will close with Pope Francis’ greatest challenge to America’s labor movement. In his Papal Encyclical Laudato Si, he spoke of the urgent need for humanity to care for the Earth, our common home. He demands that we look at the connection between the climate crisis and other environmental crises and global neoliberalism. He said: “Economic powers continue to justify the current global system where priority tends to be given to speculation and the pursuit of financial gain, which fail to take the context into account, let alone the effects on human dignity and the natural environment. Here we see how environmental deterioration and human and ethical degradation are closely linked. [As a result] whatever is fragile, like the environment, is defenseless before the interests of a deified market, which become the only rule.”Laudato Si asks working people to consider how our fate is linked to the fate of humanity, and the planet on which we live. Laudato Si says we cannot make solidarity the servant of consumerism. Instead, we must bring the fight against climate change into the larger struggle for solidarity and a new global economic system that respects the dignity of work. Our labor movement has not done enough to answer this call. Yet we must, so we can protect our common home and each other. A just transition to a low carbon economy—a transition that creates good jobs where workers have rights—can truly tear down the deified market and establish new economic rules for broad prosperity.As I close, I will return to the title of this evening’s event. Solidarity is OUR word.Five years into his Papacy, Pope Francis has catapulted the concept of solidarity to the center of the global conversation. He has both embraced and lifted up working people, and he has challenged us to be our best selves—our prophetic and innovative selves. But most of all, in his words and actions, he has been the embodiment of kindness and love—of the idea that we are bound together, that we must indeed look after each other and that as we do so, our own lives will be better.The labor movement is incredibly grateful to Pope Francis for his ministry. I hope these remarks can serve as a token of our gratitude. Thank you, and God bless you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
243,Trumka at RWDSU Convention: Our Values Show Us the Way Forward,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-rwdsu-convention-our-values-show-us-way-forward,3-3-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the RWDSU convention: Good morning, RWDSU! It is great to be with you today. Thank you, Stuart (Appelbaum), for that kind introduction. Let’s hear it for your president Stuart Appelbaum! Stuart and I have been serving together on the AFL-CIO Executive Council since 1998. He is a man of courage, conviction and compassion. I am proud to call him a brother and a friend. Now, you may not know this but Stuart recently spoke on behalf of the AFL-CIO at a conference put together by Pope Francis. I thought: who better to make our case at the Vatican than a progressive, gay, Jewish labor organizer from New York City?On Tuesday, I will be speaking at Seton Hall University in New Jersey to reflect on what Pope Francis has meant to working people five years after his election. As a Catholic, I am grateful to have a Pope that shares my values. I also know “Standing for Our Values” is the theme of this convention. And I can think of nothing more fitting. Our values unite us. They sustain us. They provide light in darkness. Our values show us the way forward.It is truly special to be with you in the great city of Atlanta. In his 1967 address to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference here, Dr. King said and I quote: “We must massively assert our dignity and worth. We must stand up amidst a system that still oppresses us and develop an unassailable and majestic sense of values.” Those words ring true today.50 years later, our economic system is still designed to hold us down. Corporations and politicians have conspired to suppress wages, slash benefits and dismantle rights. It’s way too easy to have a dangerous workplace and way too hard to form a union. The richest 400 Americans hold more wealth than all 16 million African-American households combined. These outcomes are not inevitable. Our economy is nothing more than a set of rules. Those rules are written by the men and women we elect. They decide the winners and the losers. For too long, those rules have been written to enrich corporations at our expense. But here is the good news: we can choose to do better. And that’s exactly what we’re doing.Working people are massively asserting our dignity and worth. We are standing up and speaking out. We are mobilizing and organizing and strategizing. And we are embracing the unassailable and majestic values that make our movement the single greatest force for social progress in history. It’s working! Union membership rose by more than a quarter of a million members last year. 260,000 more lives were transformed by the power of collective bargaining and lifted by unionism’s rising tide. And you helped lead the way. From H&M to Zara, from Autoneum to EchoLab, from poultry plants to car washes, the RWDSU is an organizing union!I am particularly inspired by the work you are doing here in the South. Your Alabama council has doubled, growing from 5,000 to 10,000 members. And while you were organizing, you found the time and energy to make sure Judge Roy Moore never steps foot in the United States Senate. Finally, here in Georgia, despite resistance from local management and a difficult political climate, workers at Nestle said YES to the RWDSU.One of those workers is Kim Carmichael. She’s been at the plant for 16 years. Currently, she leads the team that picks up orders for shipping. For much of her time at Nestle, she’s been driving a forklift. It’s tough work. And the hours can be long. She became increasingly frustrated with how management was dealing with workers. “We needed change,” she said. “Things weren’t being done fairly. You’d be getting different answers and even different discipline from different supervisors. It was frustrating.”Kim met a union organizer and started going to meetings. And that’s when Nestle brought in HR reps to intimidate her. They told Kim the union was bad and that she would lose wages and go out on strike. But the workers hung together. And just last week, they secured their very first union contract.Brothers and sisters, if we can organize in the South, we can organize anywhere. Our opponents are well-funded and ruthless. They’ve rigged the rules. They’ve called us names. They’ve lied. They’ve fired us. They’ve told us unions aren’t welcome. I say, bring it on! We've taken your best shot and we're still standing. We’re strong. We’re powerful. We’re united. And you ain't seen nothing yet!We’ve been on our heels for too long. The RWDSU is proving what’s possible when we go on offense. Let’s drop our shield, pick up two swords and come out swinging.We want a good job for everyone in America who wants to work. That means the freedom to bargain with your employer for a fair wage and a good life.We want health care as a fundamental human right.We should be expanding Medicare to cover everyone 55 and older. We should rein in the power and influence of drug companies. And we should repeal the tax on union health plans once and for all.We want retirement security. Real retirement security!  Let’s expand Social Security and protect our pensions. Bigger and better, brothers and sisters.We want the best infrastructure in the world. Roads. Bridges. Rail. High speed internet. Water that doesn’t poison our citizens.Unfortunately, President Trump’s plan is just another Wall Street giveaway. It includes only a fraction of the federal dollars needed to rebuild our infrastructure. It pits rural and urban communities against each other. And it embraces privatization. We can do better. Congress MUST do better! We need trillions of dollars in investment. That’s trillions with a T. Let’s rebuild America with union labor and prevailing wages.We want a fair tax system. That’s why we strongly opposed President Trump’s new tax law. It’s a windfall for the country's richest and most powerful corporate interests and actually gives employers even more incentives to ship American jobs overseas.And speaking of outsourcing, we want a new direction on trade that upholds labor rights and ends special privileges for corporations. As a candidate, President Trump promised to bring work back to our shores. Yet more than 106,000 American jobs have been lost to foreign trade since the election. Our trade deficit with China recently hit an all-time record. And NAFTA continues to wreak havoc on our manufacturing communities.Last but not least, we need to stop terrorizing immigrant workers. These are our brothers and sisters. I am sick and tired of the political games. I am sick and tired of employers cheating, exploiting and misclassifying immigrant workers. What hurts you hurts me. What’s lifts me up lifts you up. Let’s give immigrants a path to citizenship so we can all rise together as one American family.These issues are the backbone of our political program. We are committed to electing leaders who share our values and support our issues, regardless of what party they belong to. And we’re going to hold every single one of them accountable once elected. This will help us build the political strength and credibility to finally level the playing field for working families. And while we’re at it, let’s elect more union members to public office!At the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, Dr. King spoke about the dreams he had for his young children. In 2016, our family was blessed with the arrival of my grandson Trey. He’s not even two years old yet. But it’s incredible to watch the world through his eyes. The wonder. The discovery. I can’t help but sit up at night and think about what kind of America he’ll be inheriting. Ultimately, Trey will be fine. He was fortunate to be born into a loving family with means and opportunity. But for millions of working people today, that American Dream simply does not exist. Brothers and sisters, WE HAVE TO BUILD IT! For Trey’s generation and mine. For millenials and baby boomers. For the white man working harder for less and the black woman making only 63 cents on the dollar. For the immigrant worker who lives in fear. For the LGBTQ person who wants nothing more than to be themselves. WE HAVE TO BUILD IT!The title of Dr. King’s 1967 speech to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was “Where Do We Go From Here?” It’s a question we’ve been asking ourselves in the labor movement for some time. As we prepare to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Dr. King’s assassination, where he sacrificed his life for workers’ rights in another great Southern city, I submit the answer is right in front of us. It’s in every union hall I visit and every picket line I stand on. It’s in the West Virginia teachers demanding better. It’s in the brave immigrants yearning to come out of the shadows. It’s in the working women who are saying #MeToo and enough is enough. And it’s in the determination of union members who continue to amaze me every single day.Where do we go from here? WE GO UP! United by our values. Inspired by our mission.Because we’re the ones who wake America every single morning. We tuck her into bed at night. We build the cars, planes and infrastructure, lift the loads, drive the buses and ship the goods, pour the molds, connect our cities and the world. We wash the cars and prepare the food. We teach, heal and make. We package, print and bake. From the East Coast to the West Coast, and down here in the South, we make America strong. We don’t duck and run. We don’t run and hide. We are the American labor movement, and we will not be denied! Thank you. God bless you. God bless the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
244,Trumka Talks Democracy at United Steelworkers Swearing In Ceremony,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-talks-democracy-united-steelworkers-swearing-ceremony,3-1-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the swearing in ceremony for officers of the United Steelworkers: Brothers and sisters of the executive board and officers of the United Steelworkers, I’m proud to stand with you today.First off, Brother Leo [Gerard], I want to thank you, your fellow officers and your entire executive board for your leadership and service to the working men and women of the United Steelworkers, the AFL-CIO and indeed the world.  Each and every one of you is a trade unionist to your core, and I’m proud to stand alongside you in our movement for working families.When I came into union politics more than 40 years ago, it was because I believed in a movement called Miners for Democracy. Before democracy won out, you couldn’t see your own contract. If you thought you had a grievance, you’d be told, “No. You’ll have a grievance when I tell you you have a grievance.” It was a recipe for corruption, and all the ills that go along with it: worse pay and more accidents and injuries, more roof falls, more Black Lung and more death.Brothers and sisters, I don’t need to tell you the crisis of unionism we face in America, and I don’t need to tell you this comes down to a need for democracy. We need it here in the United States, where every single worker needs the freedom to negotiate in a union with employers about pay, workplace safety, benefits and retirement. You don’t get something when you don’t ask for it. Asking for it… standing for it… and fighting for it… is how we’ll win it.The same is true when it comes to our political work on Capitol Hill and in state houses and county courthouses and city halls all across this country, and quite frankly across the continent.That’s why when it comes to electoral programs and advocacy, we’re putting our issues out front, leading our politics. We don’t work for anybody but workers. In the service of workers, we will work with anybody, because America needs more politicians of every stripe who will put the interests of working people front and center. I’m serious about this. We want more pro-union Republicans and fewer corporate Democrats, so we can write new economic rules to level the playing field for working people.Last year about this time, some independent trade unionists from Mexico came to the Washington, and we met at the AFL-CIO to talk about, among other things, the need for independent and democratic unionism in Mexico. Among those union leaders were several representatives of Los Mineros, who told something of their struggles against company unions.To be honest with you, those Mexican trade unionists have been on my mind a lot over this past year, especially after the White House reopened the North American Free Trade Agreement.There’s no easy way for me to say what happened next. You know as well as I how Los Mineros tried to negotiate a contract with the owners and managers of the Media Luna mine owned by a Canadian mining company called Torex Gold. You know, as I do, how a corrupt company union signed a contract with the mine instead, guaranteeing low pay and dangerous conditions. You know that 600 workers went on strike for a democratic voice on the job on November third last year, how gunmen killed two brothers.In January, a courageous activist named Quintin Salgado was on his way to the strikers barricade when he was stopped, pulled from his vehicle. His cell phone was destroyed. He was beaten and threatened. He continued his activism. A week later, on January 22, Quintin was killed.Brothers and sisters, there is one great battle from the southern border of Mexico to the Bering Strait, and it is for democracy, a voice on the job, good pay and a good life for working people. Democracy is messy. It’s loud. It’s imperfect, as are all human endeavors, but it is also excellent. The fight of Los Mineros for democratic unionism is my fight, too. I know the United Steelworkers are neck-deep in this struggle, and God bless you for it.Back during the days of the Miners for Democracy, before we had regained control of the UMWA, the United Steelworkers was a beacon of hope, an example of how unions could and should be run, openly and democratically. In fact, your democratic tradition is the longest in our labor movement, dating back nearly 75 years. Your commitment is clear and powerful: one member, one vote. That’s as simple as it is beautiful.A spirit of openness and democracy in our unions and in American society will lead us toward greater power in the workplace, and in our politics. We will bring that spirit to the NAFTA negotiations, and to our work in electoral politics. With it will come our passion and fire. Openness and democracy will lead to greater diversity. We need it. We have plans to achieve it, and I know you do, too. All of this together will help us organize in growing sectors of the economy, and educate more people about the transformative potential of a contract on the job. Democracy leads to activism and engagement.I want to celebrate your activism and engagement. I want to congratulate all of you the honor you have to serve your union and our movement. And I know you will foster its growth. Thank you. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
245,Shuler at Working People's Day of Action: 'We're standing up for the truth.',https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-working-peoples-day-action-were-standing-truth,2-24-2018,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks at the Working People's Day of Action: Thank you very much. There’s no place I’d rather be than right here with you. Because, I’m reminded today of what Dr. King once said:“A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true.”Well, today, we’re standing up for what’s right. We’re standing up for justice. And, we’re standing up for the truth.On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Janus vs. AFSCME. And, we’re here to make one thing clear: working people will not be silenced. We’re going to speak up and tell the truth about this case.The agenda behind Janus is simple: more power for big corporations and fewer rights for the rest of us. Period. This fight isn't about one man in Illinois. It's about the single mom who relies on a strong union to bargain a decent wage. It's about the safety and economic security of a firefighter who puts their life on the line every day. It's about the teacher who wonders whether they might have to do the same. Last week in Parkland, Florida, a football coach named Aaron Feis lost his life by throwing himself in front of bullets to protect his students. His act of courage is a reminder that we should be expanding rights for our public servants, not taking them away.Today we are standing up for the everyday American heroes who protect and educate us, who care for us when we’re sick, who make our government run and who keep our communities strong. That's what working people do everyday. That's what hard working union members do every day to make lives better for everyone.

Corporations are threatening this dignity in pursuit of the almighty dollar. They want to to concentrate wealth in the hands of the few, while keeping us poor, weak and divided. Janus isn’t the first attack on our rights. And it won’t be the last. We have a huge target on our back because we are the most powerful force for working families on the planet. Unions built the middle class, won retirement security, created safe workplaces and defined what a fair economy could look like for the free world. If we are truly irrelevant, as the corporate right-wing keeps saying, then why are they so obsessed with destroying us?They know that this will hurt working people. Women will be hit hardest by a bad decision in this case, especially African American women. While Janus is a broad attempt to undermine working people, it is also a direct assault on those in the public sector. Black women make up nearly 18 percent of public sector workers.This would only add insult to injury as black women already face a double pay gap based on race and gender, earning only 67 cents on the dollar compared to a white man.One of those men, Mark Janus, wants to make life harder for those who have chosen public service. I think if Mr. Janus doesn’t like the pay, benefits and rights negotiated by his union, he should give a non-union shop a try and leave us alone!But, no matter what he and his corporate friends do, we have the power to make this Janus case irrelevant. What if we unleashed a new national campaign to demonstrate the value of our unions! Our public sector sisters and brothers are already doing this. And it’s working. The labor movement’s popularity is higher than it’s been in nearly two decades. As Janus reaches the highest court in the land, this is a moment to ask ourselves: what are the new ways we can make unions relevant and essential  to someone’s life?Remember, it’s unions who are winning equal pay and protection from discrimination and sexual harassment in our contracts as politicians fail to make even the slightest progress. It’s unions who provide the cutting edge training and education that helps workers ladder up to better jobs without a mountain of college debt. It’s unions who are helping to rebuild Puerto Rico and Texas and Florida and and all the places struck by natural disaster. And it is unions and our members who are often first to respond when a mass shooting occurs.If we demonstrate value, we become essential. And Janus loses its teeth, because workers will want to join us.Let’s demonstrate our value every day. Let’s organize. Let’s bargain. Let’s continue to lift up our families and communities. Let’s learn from our failures and build on our successes.We have the power to determine our economic future. On Monday, lawyers are going to be busy trying to persuade five people down the street. Well, I want each of you to do the same. Talk to five people. Talk to five of your friends and relatives—your co-workers and neighbors—maybe even a total stranger. And, don’t just talk to lifelong union members. Talk to young people working their first job. Talk to people who have never considered joining a union before. Show five people why unions matter. Show them what unions have done for you—and what unions can do for them.Because I can tell you one thing with certainty: if we show our value and tell our story, no court case will be able to stop us.Thank you very much.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

246,Trumka at Working People's Day of Action: Our Freedoms Will Endure,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-working-peoples-day-action-our-freedoms-will-endure,2-24-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Working People's Day of Action:Good morning. My name is Rich Trumka. I’m president of the AFL-CIO, and I’m honored to be with you today.Brothers and sisters, take a look around! I see a powerful movement. I see a growing movement. I see a winning movement!I see a movement of activists who stand up against the rich and powerful for basic freedom and dignity for regular people all across this country. When I look out at this crowd, I see solidarity. Your fight is my fight, and my fight is your fight. We are in this together, and we’re ready to rise together.50 years ago, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went to Memphis, Tennessee, to stand with sanitation workers who wore signs saying, “I AM A MAN!”Those brave and dignified workers wanted a union contract with good pay and benefits and safety on the job.Today, we are fighting for those very same things. Dr. King gave his life for freedom… freedom from want, freedom from hate, freedom to vote and freedom to join together in strong unions. Dr. King lived and died for justice.Like Dr. King, we will live for justice. We will organize for justice. We will march for justice. We will shout for justice. We will register for justice. And we’ll vote for justice.Today, all around this country, working people are standing together to support the freedom of ALL workers to join unions.The Janus case is nothing but a bald attempt by rich CEOS to use the highest court in the land to cut down our unions.Hear me now, brothers and sisters: We won’t let them!We’ll organize the old-fashioned way. Workers want a union. Workers need a union. Workers will fight for their union.Workers like my Philadelphia sister, AFT member and school teacher Bonnee (pronounced Bonnie) Breese Brentum, who explains how she and her union fought to keep a nurse in every school after a child died of an asthma attack, how she and her union in a 100 ways negotiate for each other and the children and communities they serve. Bonnee’s not afraid of the right-wing attacks on unionism, but trust me… she’s fighting back!Workers like Pennsylvania State Employees Association member Melanie Hudson, who recorded a powerful YouTube video about why she’s a union member. She’s a member because she wants a good life. Trust me. Sister Melanie is fighting back!We’re all fighting back. Public and private. We are one union family and no one, I mean no one, pushes us around.Our freedoms rise from the Constitution of the United States, which was signed not far from where we stand today. Our freedom gives us the foundation to be what we want and to join together and raise our voices together. And no matter which way the Supreme Court rules, our freedoms will endure!  We’ll stand together against the rich and powerful for a better life for your family and my family and every working family. Because we do the work. We pave the streets. We drive the busses and walk the beats. We are working people. We won’t be shoved aside. We are the American labor movement, and we will not be denied!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
247,Trumka to Western District Strategy Meeting: Working People Ready to Go on Offense,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-western-district-strategy-meeting-working-people-ready-go-offense,2-15-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following closing remarks at the Western District Strategy Session: 

Thank you, brothers and sisters.This has been a very productive meeting. We covered a lot of ground.We talked about the political landscape, the need to increase our density and the ways we can use the 2018 election to engage with our members.

We talked about the Workers’ Bill of Rights and our Path to Power program which is helping elect more union members to office.We talked about the threats of Janus and right to work and our power to overcome them.I am confident that we will leave here today with a clear vision and mission for growing our movement and winning worker power.This has never been more important.We are the only organized voice for working people in America.And guess what: momentum is on our side!260,000 new union members joined our ranks in 2017 despite a very difficult organizing environment.Three quarters of new union members are under the age of 34. The future is bright!As we gain density, we gain power. As we grow in numbers, we grow in influence. That’s how we start to build the America working people need.Brothers and sisters, we’ve been on defense for too long. It is time to go on offense. Let’s drop our shield and pick up two swords.We want a good job for everyone in America who wants to work. That means the freedom to bargain with your employer for a fair wage and a good life.We want health care as a fundamental human right.We should be expanding Medicare to cover everyone 55 and older. We should rein in the power and influence of drug companies. And we should repeal the tax on union health plans once and for all.We want retirement security. Real retirement security!  Let’s expand Social Security and protect our pensions. Bigger and better, brothers and sisters.We want the best infrastructure in the world. Roads. Bridges. Rail. High speed internet. Water that doesn’t poison our citizens.The plan President Trump released earlier this week is another Wall Street giveaway. It includes only a fraction of the federal dollars needed to rebuild our infrastructure. It pits rural and urban communities against each other. And it embraces privatization. We can do better. Congress MUST do better! We need trillions of dollars in investment. That’s trillions with a T. Let’s rebuild this country with union labor and prevailing wages.We want a fair tax system. Unfortunately, President Trump’s new tax law gives away $1.5 trillion to the country's richest and most powerful corporate interests. And WE are footing the bill. Take the state and local deduction, which Republicans capped for the first time in history. That means working people are actually paying more in taxes, not less. The average Oregonian will be out $2,600 for the year. Right here in California, you’re going to lose $8,000. $8,000...that's a year's tuition at Cal State or a nice family vacation. As if that wasn’t bad enough, the new tax law gives companies even more incentives to ship American jobs overseas.And speaking of outsourcing, we want a new direction on trade that upholds labor rights and ends special privileges for corporations. Let’s fix NAFTA the right way so it raises wages across North America.Last but not least, we need to stop terrorizing immigrant workers. These are our brothers and sisters. I am sick and tired of the political games. I am sick and tired of employers cheating, exploiting and misclassifying immigrant workers. What hurts you hurts me. What’s lifts me up lifts you up. Let’s give immigrants a path to citizenship so we can all rise together as one American family.These issues are the backbone of our political program. We are committed to electing leaders who share our values and support our issues, regardless of what party they belong to. And we’re going to hold every single one of them accountable once elected. This will help us build the political strength and credibility to finally level the playing field for working families. And we know the best way to advance our agenda is to elect more union members to public office.Working people are ready to turn the tide, go on offense and win.The labor movement is demonstrating our power. Facebook cafeteria workers from California to Washington voted to join UNITE HERE. Baggage handlers in Seattle and aircraft fuelers in Anchorage won strong new union contracts with the Machinists. Newsroom staff at the Casper Star-Tribune in Wyoming filed for an NLRB election. USW members in Idaho are bravely out on strike at the Lucky Friday Mine. Montana’s two largest public employee unions, MEA-MFT and the Montana Public Employees Association, have merged to form a larger, stronger affiliate in preparation for Janus. And our political program in Hawaii has led to pro-worker majorities of 25-0 in the State Senate and 45-5 in the State House.The test of 2018…and beyond…will be to build on these successes. Each election, each organizing drive, each legislative battle…will showcase our growing clout. But I believe you’ll see the impact of our momentum on an even broader level.When more union members fill the halls of power…when wages go up and inequality shrinks…when we have more pro-labor Republicans and fewer corporate-beholden Democrats…when a growing number of young people see the value of democracy and that we can and will change the rules of this economy…when we stop defining victory as not losing...and most of all...when more workers realize their own value and the power of solidarity…that’s when you’ll know unions are on the rise.Let’s show working people we can win! Let’s deliver the change America is hungry for. It’ll take some risk. It’ll take solidarity, but we can make it happen by standing together, marching together, fighting together… shoulder to shoulder… arm in arm… as long as it takes… let’s do it! To take America back! For workers! For the country we love! Thank you very much!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
248,Trumka Draws Inspiration from Western Region Leaders,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-draws-inspiration-western-region-leaders,2-15-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following opening remarks at the Western District Strategy Session: Thank you, Brother Art (Pulaski). Thank you to the UFCW for hosting us. And thank you all for being here.As I begin, I want to reinforce what Katie said about our Code of Conduct. I am extremely proud that last week, under the leadership of Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler, we held a convening on sexual harassment to strategize about the labor movement’s role in helping stop this epidemic. That responsibility starts with our own house. We simply will not tolerate any form of harassment, discrimination or bullying. If you experience or see something, report it to one of the designees.Today in this room we have the best trade unionists in the Western region. You are the labor movement’s eyes and ears. Every role and every job is represented here today. It is not an exaggeration to say the future of our movement and our country is in your hands.To be our best, we need to be sound in the trenches. That means executing the basics-blocking and tackling. Member engagement and communication. Organizing. Bargaining. Servicing. Leadership training. Political independence. Community outreach.Our goal for this meeting is to unite around a common purpose and strategy to win back power for workers. Over the next several hours, we’ll look at ways to neutralize Janus and right to work by organizing internally. We’ll dive into our Path to Power program which is electing union members to office from coast to coast. We’ll discuss the ways we are using data and technology to break new ground in politics AND organizing. And we’ll lay out our Labor 2018 program, with a focus on talking to our members about issues.This past June, I joined with many of you in Los Angeles for a summit on right to work. 750 labor leaders, activists and staff came together to prepare, plan and prioritize in the face of historic attacks on our rights. I left that meeting inspired. And I can tell you that your leadership helped shape the agenda we adopted at our convention in St. Louis.I want to repeat something I said in June.We will aim to defeat every attack on either the institutions of our labor movement or the core values we hold dear—freedom, equality, justice, fairness and the rights to assemble and speak freely.We will use every fight to organize internally by educating our membership about the threats we face and more importantly, our power to overcome them.You see, the corporate right-wing is betting that Janus and other attacks will knock us out.I am betting that when more working people fully understand the power of collective bargaining and collective action, our movement will grow bigger and stronger.That’s exactly what’s happening here in the Western region.In California, nearly 300 journalists at the Los Angeles Times formed the first newsroom union in the paper's 136-year history.In Alaska, labor and community activists convinced Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski to VOTE NO on legislation aimed at destroying our health care.In Washington, OPEIU member and WSLC Political Director Teresa Mosqueda was elected to the Seattle City Council.In Utah, state fed president Dale Cox, a member of the Operating Engineers, was elected to the Murray City Council.And in Oregon, labor helped pass SB 1040, a bill to prevent local governments from adopting right to work, the first of its kind in the nation.We have the power.We know our opponents are tough. They’re well-heeled and ruthless. But their deep pockets can’t overcome our deep passion for a fairer and more just nation. We didn’t start this fight. But brothers and sisters, we are going to finish it.When I look around this room, I have hope. Hope for a brighter future. Hope for a new day. Hope for an America where every worker can get ahead.We are the only ones who can deliver the massive economic and social change working people are hungry for.That’s what we’re going to do.That’s what this meeting is all about.So let’s get to work.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

249,Trumka at AFGE VA Rally: 'We hold the power.' ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-afge-va-rally-we-hold-power,2-13-2018,"Brothers and sisters, I’m Rich Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO.It is great to be here today.As I begin, I want to recognize the outstanding leadership of Senator Bernie Sanders. Bernie is a friend, an ally and a champion. Thank you, Bernie, for everything you do for working people.I want to acknowledge the president of the AFGE National VA Council, Miss Alma Lee, for being a tireless fighter for more than 250,000 VA workers. Keep fighting Alma!And I want to thank all of the elected officials, labor leaders and veterans’ advocates who have joined us.Finally, there is my brother AFGE National President J. David Cox. He’s one of a kind. And his passion is infectious. At our convention in St. Louis this past fall, inspired by the leadership of J. David, delegates unanimously passed a resolution rejecting VA privatization.

So I am here today with a mandate from our 12.5 million members. We support America’s veterans and we support the hard-working employees of the VA.

Let me be absolutely clear: We need a fully funded, fully staffed VA. The real story behind wait list manipulation at VA hospitals is short staffing.  

For years, cynical politicians have failed to provide the VA with the resources necessary to care for our brave service members.

We have a crisis of care for veterans in this country. We need solutions, not scapegoats.  

Here is the part that makes me really mad.

The corporate right-wing has deliberately created this crisis so their rich friends can profit off a scheme to privatize the VA and destroy all federally-funded health care. They want our veterans to use the skimpy vouchers that would put many on the path to medical bankruptcy.  

These are the same people who are pitting veteran against veteran by trying to cut benefits in order to pay for health care. This is disgusting. It’s un-American. And we are going to put a stop to it.

We will oppose every politician and every corporation that seeks to profit off the blood, sweat and sacrifice of our veterans.

We will reject every effort to unjustly punish the hard-working men and women of the VA.

Federal employees serve our nation proudly. You’ve endured pay freezes, furloughs and baseless political attacks. President Trump’s threat to federal employees at the State of the Union was particularly shameful.

You deserve better. Our veterans deserve better. And the labor movement demands better.

Patriotism requires more than waving a flag. It calls on us to treat public workers with dignity and respect. It demands that we lift up the VA and stop playing politics with our veterans.

Listen, we’re less than a block from the VA, and within sight of the White House. I want each of you to look around. I want you to see what I see. I see people power right where it matters.

We won’t sit back and shut up. We won’t settle for less. We hold the power!

All over this country, working people are speaking up. It’s happening right now! We hold the power!

No more attacks on the VA. No more scapegoating America’s public servants.

Let’s fight for what’s right! Together! Arm in arm. In solidarity. For our veterans. For our nation. For each other. We hold the power!

Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
250,Trumka Hails Power of Stewards at Air Line Pilots Association Training Conference,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-hails-power-stewards-air-line-pilots-association-training-conference,2-8-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the Air Line Pilots Association Leadership Training Conference: Thank you, Brother Tim [Canoll]! Thank you for inviting me to this important gathering of a great, great union. It’s good to be with you two years in a row, and I want to thank you especially for your work on the relief effort in Puerto Rico. That was incredible, amazing, but hardly surprising, to be honest, because worker organizations like the Air Line Pilots Association routinely step forward with stunning generosity in times of need. Thank you, again.Brothers and sisters, the backbone of power in the American labor movement is at the local level—local leaders and shop stewards. You deal with the nitty-gritty of contract defense, grievances and disciplinary actions. And you do it because you stepped forward when someone needed to. So more than anything, I just want to say thank you. Give yourselves a hand.Not too long ago, just like you, I stepped forward because someone needed to. I can remember those days perfectly well, and looking at you makes me remember what it was like. To be honest, the experiences I gained back then still inspire me to spend every day thinking about how best to build and keep building power for working people in this challenging political and economic environment.The answer will be neither easy nor simple, but I am confident we can get the job done.One of the first positions I held in my union, the United Mine Workers of America, was on the safety committee. Brothers and sisters, it changed me, and I believe your union work will change you, too. You’ll gain a deeper appreciation for the importance of our basic democratic freedoms on the job. You’ll stand up more quickly and forcefully against unsafe or unfair treatment. You’ll be more careful to listen to every side of an argument. You’ll learn to focus more on solutions. As you serve, you’ll strengthen your union and our entire labor movement.My work on the safety committee taught me the importance of policies and of using them. It could mean the difference between life and death and, in many cases, it did. I still watch policies today, but the view is much broader, the policies more varied. Instead of a mine office or a union hall, I’m working to influence agencies, regulations and laws, largely at the state and national level.I’ll be honest, I know the leaders I can call and who’ll listen to me, but I also know our movement is not a niche movement. We’re a mainstream movement, and we should be supported by mainstream politicians, leaders of both political parties.  That’s one reason why you’ll hear me talk about political independence, but that doesn’t mean we’re agnostic…and it certainly doesn’t mean we’ll shy away from policy debates.Here’s what it does mean. It means we work for nobody but working people. Our sole fidelity is to the men and women of our unions, to the men and women who work for a living in America, and the issues and values that lift our lives, our families and our communities.Nothing—and I mean nothing—lifts up our lives, our families and our communities better than a union contract, and one of the best examples is all around us—it’s the strong contracts and great careers fought for, won and defended by the Air Line Pilots Association!We want great success for our employers, and we want to share in that success. Your informational picket by 750 JetBlue pilots at the company’s headquarters in New York was a powerful, positive and effective demonstration of union solidarity. Great work!Your contracts are an entry point to the middle class. That’s the beauty of strong collective bargaining. It’s transformational.More American workers need that opportunity. More American workers want solidarity and the real-life gains that come with it.Our mission is clear. We want more political and economic power so we can achieve more worker wins! We want a better tomorrow, brothers and sisters, and we’ll organize for it, we’ll march for it, we’ll fight for it and we’ll vote for it. To those who want to hold us down and keep us poor—with low-road air service flying flags of convenience—to those who want to lower our pay, take our freedom and silence our voice, hear me loud and hear me clear: Your days are numbered! We are the American labor movement. We’re unified! We’re powerful! We’re determined! We’re getting stronger every day, and we will not be denied!I don’t know about you, but I’m ready for the 2018 election. I’m ready to demonstrate the power of working people. I’m ready to advance our issues and our agenda. I’m ready to help elect leaders to Congress and the states who actually give a damn about working people. And I’ll be ready to hold those leaders accountable, too, once they’re in office, to deliver on the things we need. I don’t think that’s too much to ask!Life hasn’t been easy for America’s working families. The Great Recession. Attacks on collective bargaining. Threats to basic safety standards. But our labor movement has stood strong. We’ve done ourselves proud. Everywhere I’ve been this past year, I’ve seen union members demonstrating what toughness and grit really look like. And mark my words, working together, we are going to rebuild unionism in America—and good lives and a great future. Our labor movement isn’t content to merely survive. We’re going to thrive!Last week, President Trump delivered his first State of the Union address. He painted an everything-being-great picture of America that while optimistic, is not the reality for most working families. Life may be better for President Trump’s powerful friends and associates, but the working men and women we represent aren’t seeing the same America, and many of his policies are actually making life worse.Don’t get me wrong. No matter who is in the White House, our labor movement will try to get meaningful gains for workers, and we’ll be straight about it. That’s a path I’ve followed since day one, and the door is still open. Let me give you an example. I know President Trump took a small step in the right direction…but a good step nevertheless...by reaching an “Understandings Agreement” with Qatar on aviation. We need more of that, and we are going to hold this administration accountable to make sure it's actually a good deal for America’s workers.  While he’s taken a positive step with Qatar, and rightly acknowledged our growing trade imbalance, he has done little else to level the playing field for America’s workers.
While President Trump talks about the crisis of outsourcing jobs, his tax bill actually encourages corporations to do more of it.While he promises to put America back to work rebuilding our infrastructure, he’s spent more time demonizing immigrants than making investments in our roads, bridges and airports.

And slashing regulations, one of President Trump’s biggest applause lines, really means lowering worker pay and making work more dangerous. Let me tell you, there will be no rollback of pilot training standards on my watch. Not a chance. Whoever thinks that’s going to happen will be in for a fight!

As I said before, no matter who's sitting in the White House or what they're saying on TV or what they're tweeting, working people are moving forward. We are united around an agenda to secure our economic future—fighting for the freedom to have a voice on the job, sharing in the wealth we help create and living better lives.

If President Trump wants to change course and join us in the fight to raise wages and standards, strengthen our democracy, and build better lives, I’m ready right now. If not...well, the American people are going to make a choice. No matter what, we will continue growing our union movement, keep building our momentum, laser focused on true victories that bring a better day for working people all across this country.

Brothers and sisters, America is the richest country in the world at our richest time in history, yet not in 100 years has there been such a gap between the super-wealthy and the rest of us. We’re going to keep reaching out, keep reaching up. Working people are still the most powerful force in this nation and around the world.

People feel it. People know it. And people need it. It’s all around us. That’s why public approval for the labor movement is above 60%, the highest in nearly two decades. And it’s still going up.

Yet while our profile rises, the concerted attacks from the corporate right-wing have never been as bold, sharp and empowered.None of the attacks are honest on their face. “Right to work”—I’ll tell you one thing that law doesn’t mean—it doesn’t give anybody the right to work. It’s a cynical ploy meant to lower pay and weaken workers. And legal challenges like Janus are exactly the same.Some of you have probably heard about the Janus case, which seeks to impose right to work in the public sector—in schools and hospitals and other government workplaces all across the country.And while this case doesn’t directly target airline pilots or anyone covered by the Railway Labor Act, the next one might.The groups that want to weaken and destroy our freedom to stand together in union are coming after all of us, so we ALL need to stand united against them. We won’t be timid. We won’t react out of fear. Yet we WILL fight every single effort to knock us down and knock us out.And we will use these attacks to finally go on the offense.We want a good job for everyone in America who wants to work. That means the freedom to bargain with our employer, a $15 minimum wage and equal pay for women.We want health care as a fundamental right, regardless of income, job or a pre-existing condition.We should be expanding Medicare to cover everyone 55 and older. We should rein in the power and influence of drug companies. And we should repeal the tax on union health plans once and for all!We want real retirement security. It’s time to protect pensions and expand Social Security! Bigger and better, brothers and sisters!I’m ready for real progress. I want trade deals that actually work for working people. NAFTA is crushing America’s manufacturing. President Trump said he’d win workers a better deal. Well, guess what? More jobs were outsourced in 2017 than any year in the previous five and our trade deficit is at its highest level since 2008.We want the best infrastructure in the world. Roads. Bridges. Airports. Seaports. Rail. High speed internet. Clean and safe drinking water. It’ll take investments in the trillions with a T, but those investments will pay dividends for generations.Donald Trump has talked about being a “builder president.” That’s what he’s said again and again and again. Mr. President, it is time to put up or shut up. Let’s start breaking ground. Let’s start laying bricks. Let’s rebuild this country with union labor, let’s do it now!Our test of 2018 and beyond, will be to keep raising the profile of our union movement. I believe we’re ready to do it. America’s working people came together and charted a path forward at last year’s AFL-CIO Convention in St. Louis. Now we’re hitting the ground running. We’re ready to make progress. Each election, each time we organize internally, each legislative battle will showcase our growing clout. Yet I believe you’ll see the impact of our momentum on an even broader level.When more union members fill the halls of power…when wages rise and inequality shrinks…when we have more pro-labor Republicans and fewer corporate Democrats…when a growing number of young people see the value of democracy and know we can and will change the rules of this economy…when we stop defining victory as not losing…and, most of all, when more working people realize our own value and the power of solidarity…that’s when you’ll know unions are truly on the rise.Let’s show America what victory looks like!It’ll take work. It’ll take risk. It’ll take solidarity. But we can make it happen by standing together, marching together, fighting together…shoulder to shoulder…arm in arm…as long as it takes…let’s do it! To take America back! This is our time. This is our moment. We’re ready for a fight. Our opponents are bold. They’re well-funded and ruthless. I say, bring it on! We've taken their best shot and we're still standing, still getting stronger! Thank you. God bless you. God bless the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
251,"Trumka to Northeast District Strategy Session: ""We are the only organized voice for working people in America.""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-northeast-district-strategy-session-we-are-only-organized-voice-working-people,2-7-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following closing remarks at the Northeast District Strategy Session: Thank you, brothers and sisters.This has been a very productive meeting. We covered a lot of ground.We talked about the political landscape, the need to increase our density and the ways we can use the 2018 election to engage with our members.We talked about the Workers’ Bill of Rights and our Path to Power program which is helping elect more union members to office.We talked about the threats of Janus and right to work and our power to overcome them.And we also made some important asks like assigning local union coordinators, identifying elected officials who are union members and incorporating Common Sense Economics into  your outreachI am confident that we will leave here today with a clear vision and mission for growing our movement and winning worker power.This has never been more important.Listen, there is no denying that 2017 was a difficult year for working people.Corporations did everything in their power to hold down wages. Inequality grew. And politicians at the federal and state level launched a new wave of attacks on our dignity and rights.Yet even in the face of these challenges, we stood strong. The labor movement demonstrated our power with historic strikes, organizing victories and powerful new contracts that saved jobs, raised pay and expanded retirement security. We passionately made our case for a new set of economic rules designed to achieve broadly shared prosperity. America has taken notice. Our approval rating is more than 60 percent, the highest in almost two decades.Our test of 2018…and beyond…will be to build on these successes. Each election, each organizing drive, each legislative battle…will showcase our growing clout. But I believe you’ll see the impact of our momentum on an even broader level.When more union members fill the halls of power…when wages go up and inequality shrinks…when we have more pro-labor Republicans and fewer corporate-beholden Democrats…when a growing number of young people see the value of democracy and that we can and will change the rules of this economy…when we stop defining victory as not losing...and most of all...when more workers realize their own value and the power of solidarity…that’s when you’ll know unions are on the rise.That moment is close. I feel it in every union hall I visit and every picket line I stand on. I feel it in every politician who looks at us differently since we stopped the TPP. I feel it when I talk to brave immigrants ready to come out of the shadows and working women who are saying enough is enough. And I feel it here today.Brothers and sisters, we have to engage with our members. Let’s make it clear to every working person in the Northeast that the change they are looking for can be found by standing together in unions. We are the only organized voice for working people in America. Not Republicans. Not Democrats. The labor movement.The corporate right-wing is betting that Janus and other attacks will knock us out.I am betting that when more working people fully understand the power of collective bargaining and collective action, they will want to join and stay and pay. I also want to remind you of this simple fact: right to work does not stop anyone from signing a union card. And it does not cause a single worker to lose their collective bargaining rights.The special interests that want to destroy unions have been coming after our rights for 50 years. Well, guess what? We’re still here! Our opponents may have the money. But we have the truth. And the truth is that union dues provide an incredible return on investment. The truth is that belonging to a union is like being part of a family that will always have your back. The truth is that corporations have become way too strong in America, and the only way to create balance and fairness in the workplace is by joining a union. This is a message we must continue to spread inside and outside our ranks.The challenge ahead of us is massive. We know our opponents are tough. They’re well-heeled and ruthless. But their deep pockets can’t overcome our deep passion for a fairer and more just nation. We didn’t start this fight. But brothers and sisters, we are going to finish it.Let’s show working people we can win! Let’s deliver the change America is hungry for. It’ll take risk. It’ll take solidarity, but we can make it happen by standing together, marching together, fighting together… shoulder to shoulder… arm in arm… as long as it takes… let’s do it! To take America back! For workers! For the country we love! Thank you very much!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
252,"Trumka to UAW Political Conference: ""You wrote a comeback story."" ",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-uaw-political-conference-you-wrote-comeback-story,2-7-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the 2018 UAW National CAP Conference:

Thank you, Brother Dennis [Williams]! You’re a powerful leader and a true trade unionist. Thank you for inviting me to this important gathering of a great, great union.Brothers and sisters, I recently had the privilege to lead a strategy session of AFL-CIO unions in the Great Lakes region. We were there to talk about the best ways to build power for working people in this hard political and economic climate.Your president gave a truly inspiring speech there, and, Brother Dennis, I want to personally thank you for it. You talked about the importance of building political independence; of facing each challenge with strength, not fear; of putting our agenda out front…an agenda that’s first, last and always anchored in the deep principles of trade unionism. You said the backbone of our strength is our members. You said our power base is in our local unions. You said it all, President Williams!Member education and mobilization at the local level is how we’ll build power for working people’s issues. Our number one issue is raising pay, and the best way to raise pay is in a union.When you consider why people want to join unions, look no further than the United Auto Workers.Ten years ago, America’s auto industry was on the brink of extinction. The greatest manufacturing power in the history of the world stood on wobbly legs, the result of corporate mismanagement and bad public policy. Autoworkers didn’t cause this crisis. But you agreed to help fix it. The UAW took a risk, embracing the idea of profit-sharing. By doing so, you gave the auto industry new life. Some politicians said…and I quote…“Let Detroit go bankrupt,” but instead you wrote a comeback story.As a result of your commitment to a shared American future, our auto industry is as healthy and profitable as it ever has been, and those profit-sharing checks are coming in, I’m told, as strong as $8,000 and even $10,000. Congratulations!Paychecks like that can change your life. That’s the beauty of good bargaining, of strong negotiations. It’s transformational. It can lift up entire communities.More American workers need that opportunity. More American workers want solidarity and the real-life gains that come with it.Our mission is clear. We want more political and economic power for more worker wins! We want good trade deals and major investments in public education and infrastructure and worker training! We want a better tomorrow, brothers and sisters, and we’ll organize for it, we’ll march for it, we’ll fight for it and we’ll vote for it. To those who want to hold us down and keep us poor…to those who want to lower our pay, take our freedom and silence our voice…to those who wanted to let the auto industry die…hear me loud and hear me clear: Your days are numbered! We are the American labor movement. We’re unified! We’re powerful! We’re determined! We’re getting stronger every day, and we will not be denied!I don’t know about you, but I’m ready for the 2018 election. I’m ready to demonstrate the power of working people. I’m ready to advance our issues and our agenda. I’m ready to return Congress and the states to leaders who actually give a damn about working people. And I’m ready to hold those leaders accountable, once they’re in office, to deliver on the things we need. I don’t think that’s too much to ask!Life hasn’t been easy for America’s working families. The Great Recession. The auto crisis. Right to work. Privatization. And the broken promises of Donald Trump. But the UAW has stood strong. You’ve done the labor movement proud. You’ve shown what toughness and grit really look like. And mark my words, working together, we are going to rebuild unionism in America…and good lives and a great future. Our labor movement isn’t content to merely survive. We’re going to thrive!Brothers and sisters, we’ve been on defense for too long. It is time to go on offense.We want a good job for everyone in America who wants to work. That means the freedom to bargain with your employer, a $15 minimum wage and equal pay for women.We want health care as a fundamental right, regardless of income, job or a pre-existing condition.We should be expanding Medicare to cover everyone 55 and older. We should rein in the power and influence of drug companies. And we should repeal the tax on union health plans once and for all!We want real retirement security. It’s time to protect pensions and expand Social Security! Bigger and better, brothers and sisters!We want the best infrastructure in the world. Roads. Bridges. Bus service. Rail. High speed internet. Water that doesn’t poison our citizens. It will require trillions of dollars in investment, but the investments will pay dividends for generations. Donald Trump has talked about being a “builder president.” That’s what he’s said again and again and again. Mr. President, it is time to put up or shut up. Let’s start breaking ground. Let’s start laying bricks. Let’s rebuild this country with union labor and do it now!I’m ready for real progress. I want trade deals that actually work for working people. NAFTA is crushing America’s manufacturing. President Trump said he’d win workers a better deal. Well, guess what? More jobs were outsourced in 2017 than any year in the previous five. Listen to this: Despite soaring profits, America has fewer auto industry jobs than we had just one year ago.And President Trump’s new tax law gives companies even more money to ship America’s jobs overseas. Working people need a new direction on trade. Trade rules should support labor freedom and end special rights for corporations. And it’s time to end, once and for all, each and every tax break for outsourcing!Last but not least, we want immigrant workers to have the freedom to negotiate for a better life. These are our brothers and sisters. They make our movement and our country strong. An attack on one worker is an attack on all of us. Congress needs to restore TPS and DACA and finally pass comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.This agenda is something the members of the UAW have understood since day one. And it’s the backbone of labor’s unified political program.We are committed to electing leaders who share our values and support our issues, no matter the letter next to their name.Our agenda and values come first. That’s how electoral wins will translate into working family policies.That’s why we will never shy away from opportunities to advance the issues we care about, no matter who happens to be in power. It’s why we must hold every elected leader accountable, regardless of what party they belong to. And it’s a reminder of how important it is to elect more union members to office.Last week, President Trump delivered his first State of the Union address. He painted an everything-being-great picture of America that while optimistic, is not the reality for most working families. Life may be better for President Trump’s powerful friends and associates, but the working men and women we represent aren’t seeing the same America; and his policies are actually making it worse. The truth is many of the things he says are undermined by the actual policies he supports.While he’s rightly acknowledged problems in trade, America’s workers are still victim to corporate-designed deals, and last week he offered no solutions to make NAFTA benefit working people.While President Trump recognizes the crisis of outsourcing jobs, his tax bill actually encourages corporations to do it.While he promises to put America back to work building infrastructure, he still hasn’t offered up a single nickel to do it.And slashing regulations, one of President Trump’s biggest applause lines, really means lowering worker pay and making work more dangerous.

Here’s the truth: No matter who's sitting in the White House or what they're saying on TV or what they're tweeting, working people are moving forward. We are united around an agenda to secure our economic future—fighting for the freedom to have a voice on the job, share in the wealth we help create and live better lives.If President Trump wants to change course and join us in the fight to raise wages and standards, strengthen our democracy and build better lives, I’m ready right now. If not…well, the American people are going to make a choice. But no matter what, we’re going to keep growing our movement, keep building our momentum...laser focused on true victories that bring a better day for working people all across this country.Brothers and sisters, America is the richest country in the world at our richest time in history, yet not in 100 years has there been such a gap between the super-wealthy and the rest of us. We’re going to keep reaching out, keep reaching up. Working people are still the most powerful force in this nation and around the world.People feel it. People know it, and people need it. It’s all around us. The American public knows where we stand. That’s why public approval for the labor movement is above 60%, the highest in nearly two decades. And it’s rising.We are the only organized voice for working people in America. We have no other fidelity. We’ll keep organizing, keep mobilizing, keep educating and keep fighting. We want every worker to have a fair share…today, tomorrow and every single day. It’s the UAW way!Let me tell you something. I am so proud to stand in front of you. More than 80 years ago, my union—the United Mine Workers of America—formed a series of organizing committees. The Steel Workers Organizing Committee. The Chemical Workers Organizing Committee. The Auto Workers Organizing Committee. Those committees became unions. You know the story. Those committees grew into some of the most powerful organizations in American history and created the greatest middle class the world has ever known!The United Auto Workers. You’re still organizing. You’re autoworkers, yes, but you’re also teachers and nurses and writers and so much more. And I’m going to ask you to do more and to be even more than that.Our test of 2018…and beyond…will be to keep raising our public profile. I believe we’re ready to do it. America’s working people came together and charted a path forward at last year’s AFL-CIO Convention in St. Louis. Now we’re heading down that path. We’re ready to make progress. Each election, each organizing drive, each legislative battle...will showcase our growing clout. Yet I believe you’ll see the impact of our momentum on an even broader level.When more union members fill the halls of power…when wages rise and inequality shrinks…when we have more pro-labor Republicans and fewer corporate Democrats…when a growing number of young people see the value of democracy and know we can and will change the rules of this economy…when we stop defining victory as the smallest possible loss...and, most of all…when more working people realize our own value and the power of solidarity…that’s when you’ll know unions are truly on the rise.We’ll create jobs by investing in infrastructure and the basic research that drives manufacturing. We’ll create prosperity by winning more organizing drives, by positioning our unions in growing industries and by negotiating hard to win more of the wealth we create.Let’s show America what victory looks like!It’ll take work. It’ll take risk. It’ll take solidarity, but we can make it happen by standing together, marching together, fighting together…shoulder to shoulder…arm in arm…as long as it takes…let’s do it! To take America back! This is our time. This is our moment. We’re ready for a fight. Our opponents are bold. They’re well-funded and ruthless. I say, bring it on! We've taken their best shot and we're still standing, still getting stronger! Thank you. God bless you. God bless the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
253,Trumka: Labor Has a Special Responsibility to Stop Sexual Harassment,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-labor-has-special-responsibility-stop-sexual-harassment,2-6-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at a labor movement convening on sexual harassment:Good morning, everybody. And thank you for being here.I want to start by reading the AFL-CIO Code of Conduct, which is also printed out on the cards in front of you. It is as follows:The AFL-CIO is committed to providing an environment free from discrimination and harassment, regardless of an individual’s race, ethnicity, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity or expression, ancestry, pregnancy, or any other characteristic prohibited by law.As such, the AFL-CIO will not tolerate discriminatory, harassing or otherwise unacceptable behavior in the workplace or at any of its activities, events or meetings. It adopts the following code of conduct and expects everyone in the workplace—and those who participate in any of its activities, events or meetings—to abide by it.Our designee for this meeting is Chris Neff, executive assistant to the secretary-treasurer. If you see or experience something that you think is prohibited by the code, please let Chris know.Long before Harvey Weinstein became a household name, we adopted this comprehensive Code of Conduct that goes beyond the law of the land and is read at every AFL-CIO event throughout the country.When we begin our union events with these important words, it’s a powerful signal that harassment, retaliation and discrimination won’t be tolerated; and it helps move the cultural change we need at work and in our unions.This conversation we are about to have is long overdue. I am extremely proud of and humbled by the courage of women who are bringing the issue of sexual harassment to the forefront, including my sister and partner AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler.I also want to recognize and thank the labor leaders who have joined us today, along with the incredible allies and partners who are leading this work and strengthening the important intersection of workers’, women’s and civil rights.Together, we can create an America where every single person can work free from sexual harassment.This meeting is so important. We need men and women working together to end sexual harassment in the workplace. And some of us are in positions of power to influence the culture in our organizations and workplaces. That’s right. I want to acknowledge my privilege.I came from humble beginnings. And I’ve worked hard to get where I am today. But there is no denying I am a white man in a position of power. Social and cultural norms have been specifically enforced to benefit people like me.When I go to work, I don’t have to worry about someone touching me inappropriately or judging me by what I’m wearing. I don’t have to live in fear of harassment or reprisal. When I speak with passion and conviction, no one calls me bossy.Let me assert another hard truth.Labor has been part of the problem.The sexism and misogyny in our ranks has been tolerated for far too long. Some of you have personally experienced it. The looks. The comments. The innuendo.This old boys’ club mentality must die, and it must die today.Here is the good news: Labor is part of the solution.  We are still the greatest force for social change in America.We can combat sexism with solidarity. We can tear down misogyny with movement building. We can use our contracts to discourage bad behavior and punish bad actors.That’s exactly what we are focused on here today.Let me leave you with this.No worker should be treated like a piece of property.No one should be touched, bullied, harassed, assaulted or discriminated against on the job.We must do everything in our power to protect working people from sexism, misogyny, racism, xenophobia, transphobia and homophobia. And we must hold abusers accountable.Every single person who lives and works in America has the right to do so safely.And we have a special responsibility to make that happen.I’m here today as the leader of the AFL-CIO because stopping sexual harassment is both an institutional priority and a moral necessity. But our conscience on this issue is my friend and partner Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler. I am committed to listening to her and working with all of you to make the needed changes to end sexual harassment once and for all.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
254,"Trumka at Great Lakes District Strategy Session: ""It is time to go on offense.""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-great-lakes-district-strategy-session-it-time-go-offense,1-25-2018,"Thank you, brothers and sisters.This has been a very productive meeting. We covered a lot of ground.We talked about the political landscape, the need to increase our density and the ways we can use the 2018 election to engage with our members.We talked about the Workers’ Bill of Rights and our Path to Power program which is helping elect more union members to office.We talked about the threats of Janus and right to work and our power to overcome them.And we also made some important asks. I’d like to reiterate those one final time.I am confident that we will leave here today with a clear vision and mission for growing our movement and winning worker power.This has never been more important.President Trump won the Great Lakes by promising a new day for working people.He said the right things about trade, infrastructure and manufacturing. He talked about holding Wall Street accountable.He tapped into the anger and frustration of those who are working harder for less.I believe the lesson of 2016 is that we have to engage with our members. If we don’t, someone else will. We need to establish ironclad member relationships that are stronger than any politician.Brothers and sisters,let’s make it clear to every working person in Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that the change they are looking for can be found by standing together in unions.We are the only organized voice for working people in America.If you’re a coal miner who wants to be safe on the job, join a union. If you’re a teacher who wants a voice at work, join a union. If you’re a single mother who wants equal pay, join a union. If you’re an immigrant worker who wants respect, dignity and rights, join a union. If you’re LGBTQ and want to make sure you can never be fired because of who you are, join a union.And guess what: workers are joining!Last week, the annual numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics came out. We gained 260,000 new union members nationwide. Most of these increases were aligned with growth in the economy, but we made gains nonetheless, in a very difficult organizing environment.Labor unions here in Michigan added 52,000 members. Tens of thousands of workers signed union cards in right to work states and right to work shops. And three quarters of new union members are under the age of 34. The future is bright!As we gain density, we gain power. As we grow in numbers, we grow in influence. That’s how we start to build the America working people need.Brothers and sisters, we’ve been on defense for too long. It is time to go on offense.We want a good job for everyone in America who wants to work. That means the freedom to bargain with your employer for a fair wage and a good life.We want health care as a fundamental human right.We should be expanding Medicare to cover everyone 55 and older. We should rein in the power and influence of drug companies. And we should repeal the tax on union health plans once and for all.We want retirement security. Real retirement security!  Let’s expand Social Security and protect our pensions.We want the best infrastructure in the world. Roads. Bridges. Rail. High speed internet. Water that doesn’t poison our citizens. That requires trillions of dollars in investment. Donald Trump talked about being a “builder president.” Mr. President, put up or shut up. Let’s start breaking ground. Let’s start laying bricks. Let’s rebuild this country with union labor and prevailing wages.We want trade deals that actually work for working people. NAFTA is crushing the Great Lakes. And the new tax law gives companies even more incentives to ship American jobs overseas. Working people are demanding a new direction on trade that upholds labor rights and ends special privileges for corporations. And we are calling for an end to each and every tax break that rewards outsourcing.Last but not least, we want immigrant workers to have the freedom to negotiate for a better life. These are our brothers and sisters. They make our movement and our country strong. An attack on one worker is an attack on all of us. Congress needs to restore TPS and DACA and finally pass comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.This agenda is the backbone of our political program. We are committed to electing leaders who share our values and support our issues, regardless of the letter next to their name. It’s important for our members to understand that electoral wins don’t always translate into good policy.That’s why we will never shy away from opportunities to advance the issues we care about, no matter who happens to be in power. It’s why we must hold every elected leader accountable, regardless of what party they belong to. And it’s a reminder how important it is to elect more union members to office.Brothers and sisters, there is no substitute for working people bargaining collectively for a fair share of the wealth we help create. It leads to higher wages, better benefits, safer workplaces and a more robust economy. Corporations and their hired politicians have been waging war on the fundamental right to collective bargaining for decades, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to deny us a voice. The political attack on unions has left America weaker. But we’re not going anywhere.

Today there are millions of Americans who want and need a union but are being prevented from forming one by their employer. And instead of penalizing bad actors, our outdated labor laws have made suppressing the voice of workers nothing more than the cost of doing business. This must change.Working people are ready to turn the tide, go on offense and win. We see it every day from
coast to coast, in industries far and wide. 260,000 is just the tip of the iceberg.This much is clear: our job has never been more important. Our unity has never been stronger. We are ready to do the hard work of rebuilding the American Dream. That is our agenda. That is the way forward.Let’s show working people we can win! Let’s deliver the change America is hungry for. It’ll take risk. It’ll take solidarity, but we can make it happen by standing together, marching together, fighting together… shoulder to shoulder… arm in arm… as long as it takes… let’s do it! To take America back! For workers! For the country we love! Thank you very much!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
255,Trumka Kicks Off Great Lakes District Strategy Session ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-kicks-great-lakes-district-strategy-session,1-25-2018,"Thank you, Brother Ron (Bieber). And thank you all for being here.

As I begin, I want to reinforce what Katie (Corrigan) said about our Code of Conduct. We simply will not tolerate any form of harassment, discrimination, or bullying. If you experience or see something, report it to one of the designees. We are committed to making the AFL-CIO a work environment that is fun, safe and free.Today in this room we have the best trade unionists in the Great Lakes region. You are the labor movement’s eyes and ears. Every role and every job is represented here today. It is not an exaggeration to say the future of our movement and our country is in your hands.We are committed to building the biggest and most effective member to member program in our history, and not just during elections. Union members are our best advocates and our most trusted messengers. To be our best, we need to be sound in the trenches. That means getting back to basics. Member engagement and communication. Organizing. Bargaining. Servicing. Leadership training. Political independence. Community outreach.Our goal for this meeting is to unite around a common purpose and strategy to win back power for workers. Over the next several hours, we’ll look at ways to neutralize Janus and right to work by organizing internally. We’ll dive into our Path to Power program which is electing union members to office from coast to coast. We’ll discuss the ways we are using data and technology to break new ground in politics AND organizing. And we’ll lay out our Labor 2018 program, with a focus on talking to our members about issues.There is no denying that 2017 was a difficult year for working people.Corporations did everything in their power to hold down wages. Inequality grew. And politicians at the federal and state level launched a new wave of attacks on our dignity and rights.Our job has been particularly challenging here in the Great Lakes. Anti-worker politicians control all eight of the legislative chambers in this region and three out of four governor’s mansions. And I don’t need to remind you that Donald Trump used pro-worker rhetoric to sweep Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania on the way to the White House.Yet even in the face of these challenges, we stood strong. The labor movement demonstrated our power with historic strikes, organizing victories and powerful new contracts that saved jobs, raised pay and expanded retirement security. We passionately made our case for a new set of economic rules designed to achieve broadly shared prosperity. America has taken notice. Our approval rating is more than 60 percent, the highest in almost two decades.Our test of 2018…and beyond…will be to build on these successes. Each election, each organizing drive, each legislative battle…will showcase our growing clout. But I believe you’ll see the impact of our momentum on an even broader level.At the AFL-CIO convention in St. Louis this past October, we adopted a comprehensive strategic plan to grow and strengthen the labor movement.A Workers’ Bill of Rights. A recommitment to organizing. Issue-based politics. More union members in office. Equity and diversity. Shaping the future of work.Now we must turn that strategy into victory.When more union members fill the halls of power…when wages go up and inequality shrinks…when we have more pro-labor Republicans and fewer corporate-beholden Democrats…when a growing number of young people see the value of democracy and that we can and will change the rules of this economy…when we stop defining victory as not losing...and most of all...when more workers realize their own value and the power of solidarity…that’s when you’ll know unions are on the rise.That moment is close. I feel it in every union hall I visit and every picket line I stand on. I feel it in every politician who looks at us differently since we stopped the TPP. I feel it when I talk to brave immigrants ready to come out of the shadows and working women who are saying enough is enough. And I feel it here today.The challenge ahead of us is massive. We know our opponents are tough. They’re well-heeled and ruthless. But their deep pockets can’t overcome our deep passion for a fairer and more just nation. We didn’t start this fight. But brothers and sisters, we are going to finish it.When I look around this room, I have hope. Hope for a brighter future. Hope for a new day. Hope for an America where every worker can get ahead.We are the only ones who can deliver the massive economic and social change working people are hungry for.That’s what we’re going to do.

It’s wonderful to be here with you in Michigan. This is union country.I don’t know about you, but I’m ready for the 2018 election. I’m ready to demonstrate the power of working people. I’m ready to advance our issues and our agenda. I’m ready to return the governor’s mansion and the state legislature to leaders who actually give a damn about workers. I don’t think that’s too much to ask!I know how difficult it’s been here in Michigan. The auto crisis. Right to work. Flint. Privatization. And the surprise election of Donald Trump. But you’ve stood strong. You’ve done the labor movement proud. You’ve shown what toughness and grit really look like. And mark my words, working together, we are going to keep Michigan a prevailing wage state!Repealing the prevailing wage is just another way for corporations to rig the economic rules. Right to work. Tax cuts for the rich. Attacks on our health care and retirement. We’ve seen this script before. How can anyone possibly argue that a pay cut is good for working people? This is same kind of trickle-down nonsense that brought us to the brink of a second Great Depression. We simply will not stand for it.I don’t need to tell you about the virtues of prevailing wage and Davis-Bacon. These laws have bipartisan support. Davis and Bacon were both Republicans. They knew that the union scale means professionalism. It means jobs done safely, on time and under budget. It means fair pay so parents can raise families and live decent lives. That’s what we stand for. It’s what we’ll fight for.Raising wages is just one piece of our proactive legislative agenda. Brothers and sisters, we’ve been on defense for too long. It is time to go on offense.

We want a good job for everyone in America who wants to work. That means the freedom to bargain with your employer, a $15 minimum wage and equal pay for women.

We want health care as a fundamental right.

We should be expanding Medicare to cover everyone 55 and older. We should rein in the power and influence of drug companies. And we should repeal the tax on union health plans once and for all.

We want real retirement security. We should be expanding Social Security and protecting our pensions!

We want the best infrastructure in the world. Roads. Bridges. Rail. High speed internet. Water that doesn’t poison our citizens. That requires trillions of dollars in investment. Donald Trump talked about being a “builder president.” Mr. President, put up or shut up. Let’s start breaking ground. Let’s start laying bricks. Let’s rebuild this country with union labor and prevailing wages.

We want trade deals that actually work for working people. NAFTA is crushing Michigan. And the new tax law gives companies even more incentives to ship American jobs overseas. Working people are demanding a new direction on trade that upholds labor rights and ends special privileges for corporations. And we are calling for an end to each and every tax break that rewards outsourcing.

Last but not least, we want freedom for immigrant workers. These are our brothers and sisters. They make our movement and our country strong. An attack on them is an attack on all of us. Congress needs to restore TPS and DACA and finally pass comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship.

This agenda is the backbone of our political program. We are committed to electing leaders who share our values and support our issues, regardless of the letter next to their name. It’s important for our members to understand that electoral wins don’t always translate into good policy.

That’s why we will never shy away from opportunities to advance the issues we care about, no matter who happens to be in power. It’s why we must hold every elected leader accountable, regardless of what party they belong to. And it’s a reminder how important it is to elect more union members to office.Our mission is clear. We want worker wins! We want prevailing wages! We want investments in public education and infrastructure and worker training! We want a better tomorrow, brothers and sisters, and we’ll organize for it, we’ll march for it, we’ll scrap for it and we’ll vote for it. To those who want to hold us down and keep us poor… to those who want to lower our wages and silence our voice, hear me loud and hear me clear: your days are numbered! We are the American labor movement and we will not be denied!In the face of relentless attacks, working people are fighting back and gaining ground. Listen to this: unions in Michigan added 52,000 members in 2017. That’s incredible. And you did it with Rick Snyder, Donald Trump, a Republican Congress, a Republican legislature and right to work. Clearly, momentum is on our side. Union membership rose by a quarter of a million members last year… that’s 260,000 more lives transformed by the power of collective bargaining, lifted by unionism’s step ladder toward the middle class. 1,000 nurses down the road in Traverse City said yes to a voice on the job. And across the country in California, nearly 300 journalists at the Los Angeles Times formed the first newsroom union in the paper's 136-year history.Brothers and sisters, America is taking notice. Our approval rating is above 60 percent, the highest in almost two decades. And it’s rising.Our test of 2018…and beyond…will be to build on these successes, and that’s what we’ll do. We charted a path forward at last year’s AFL-CIO Convention in St. Louis. We’re ready to make progress. Each election, each organizing drive, each legislative battle… will showcase our growing clout. Yet I believe you’ll see the impact of our momentum on an even broader level.When more union members fill the halls of power…when wages rise and inequality shrinks…when we have more pro-labor Republicans and fewer corporate-beholden Democrats…when a growing number of young people see the value of democracy and that we can and will change the rules of this economy…when we stop defining victory as not losing...and most of all...when more workers realize their own value and the power of solidarity…that’s when you’ll know unions are on the rise.

That moment is close. I can feel it coming. I feel it in every union hall I visit and every picket line I stand on. I feel it in every politician who looks at us differently since we stopped the TPP. I feel it when I talk to brave immigrants ready to come out of the shadows and working women who are saying enough is enough.

And I feel it in the disappointment and determination of working people, one year into the Trump Administration.

As a candidate, President Trump said a lot of the right things on trade, manufacturing and infrastructure. But his actions haven’t followed suit. Where is the infrastructure package? Where is the NAFTA fix? What happened to labeling China as a currency manipulator?Broken promises are bad enough. But President Trump has also used his office to actively hurt working people. He has joined with corporations and their political allies to undermine the right of workers to bargain collectively. He has taken money out of our pockets and made our workplaces less safe. He has divided our country, abandoned our values and given cover to racism and other forms of bigotry.

At the end of the day, this is bigger than any politician or president. It’s about making progress for regular working people. If President Trump wants to change course and join us in the fight to raise wages and standards, strengthen our democracy and build better lives, we will be ready. But if he continues down his current path, workers will be looking for a new president.

Regardless of who’s in the White House, we’re going to keep growing our movement and keep building our momentum, laser focused on true victories that bring a better day for regular working people here in Michigan and across this country.Brothers and sisters, we are the richest country in the world at our richest point in history, yet at no time in the past century has there been such a gap between the super-wealthy and the rest of us.This is our opportunity. We are the only organized voice for working people in America. We have no other fidelity. We care about wages, about healthy workplaces, about our brothers and sisters and our communities.The economy isn’t like the weather. Jobs don’t blow in from the Great Lakes, and they sure don’t come from tax breaks to billionaires. The economy is nothing but a set of rules. The rules are written by the men and women we elect. Those rules decide the winners and the losers, and for nearly four decades, they've been written to ensure working people are the losers.

Brothers and sisters, we can change this.We can create jobs by investing in infrastructure and the basic research that drives manufacturing. We can create prosperity and a better future with quality public education and worker training and a real fix for bad trade deals, so trade can lift us up, not tear us down.Best of all, we can create prosperity by winning more organizing drives, by positioning our unions in growing industries and by negotiating hard to win more of what we create.Let’s show America what victory looks like! It’ll take work. It’ll take risk. It’ll take solidarity, but we can make it happen by standing together, marching together, fighting together… shoulder to shoulder… arm in arm… as long as it takes… let’s do it! To take Michigan back! To take America back! This is our time. This is our moment. We’re ready for a fight. Our opponents are bold. They’re well-funded and ruthless. I say, bring it on! We've taken your best shot and we're still standing. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
257,Trumka: President Trump Has Used Office to Hurt Working People ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-president-trump-has-used-office-hurt-working-people,1-23-2018,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delvered the following remarks at a roundtable with reporters marking the one-year anniversary of President Trump's inauguration:A week from today, President Trump will give his first state of the union address. In my experience, the best way to measure our country’s success is by talking directly to working people. Workers will tell you if we are winning or losing. Of course, economic indicators like wages, unemployment and union density are part of the story. But it is often the intangibles…those things that are harder to put a finger on...that truly define victory. When worker power is rising, you will feel it.I’ll be perfectly frank. 2017 was a difficult year for working people. Corporations did everything in their power to hold down wages. Inequality grew. And politicians at the federal and state level launched a new wave of attacks on our dignity and rights.Yet even in the face of these challenges, we stood strong. We organized. We elected union members to office. We raised wages. We passionately made our case for a new set of economic rules designed to achieve broadly shared prosperity. And America has taken notice. Our approval rating is more than 60 percent, the highest in almost two decades.Our test of 2018…and beyond…will be to build on these successes, and that’s what we’ll do. Each election, each organizing drive, each legislative battle…will showcase our growing clout. But I believe you’ll see the impact of our momentum on an even broader level.When more union members fill the halls of power…when wages rise and inequality shrinks…when we have more pro-labor Republicans and fewer corporate-beholden Democrats…when a growing number of young people see the value of democracy and that we can and will change the rules of this economy…when we stop defining victory as not losing...and most of all...when more workers realize their own value and the power of solidarity…that’s when you’ll know unions are on the rise.That moment is close.

I feel it when I talk to brave immigrants ready to come out of the shadows and working women who are saying enough is enough.And I feel it in the disappointment and determination of working people, one year into the Trump Administration.When President Trump was elected, I made a commitment to give him every chance possible to deliver on his promises about trade, manufacturing and infrastructure. This angered some of my friends. But as a labor movement, we practice political independence. That means we always look for opportunities to advance the issues we care about, no matter what political party happens to be in power. And it also means we hold every elected leader accountable to our agenda and our values.President Trump said a lot of the right things as a candidate. But his actions haven’t followed suit. There’s been no effort to label China as a currency manipulator. He’s rejected plans to revitalize our coal communities. And despite calling himself a “builder president,” he’s done nothing to invest in America’s infrastructure.Broken promises are bad enough. But President Trump has also used his office to actively hurt working people. He has joined with corporations and their political allies to undermine the right of workers to bargain collectively. He has taken money out of our pockets and made our workplaces less safe.

258,Trumka on Technological Change and the Future of Work,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-technological-change-and-future-work,12-10-2017,"Good afternoon everyone.Let me start by thanking you, Mr. Secretary General, and the OECD at large, for this opportunity to meet and to exchange views. The Liaison Committee Meeting is an important moment for us, the TUAC and the constituencies that we represent. It is an opportunity for a conversation on the policy issues that you have to deal with and that matter for the labour movement. As you can see, we are here in number, with Ohmi-san of Rengo and Jorunn Berland of the Norwegian unions with whom I have the privilege to lead the TUAC, but also Sharan Burrow of the ITUC, Luca Vinsentini of the ETUC and my other colleagues of the TUAC. Let me also make a special welcome to Nolberto Diaz, general secretary of the CUT Chile, which today became the 59th member of the TUAC. Nolberto will have an opportunity to take the floor when we come to the conclusion of our meeting today.For today’s conversation, we want to address the twin challenges of the Future of Work and the Future of the Firm.The Future of Work is rightfully a central focus of the OECD today, with the on-going review of the OECD Jobs Strategy.  We hope the OECD will bring its leadership, hopefully in close coordination with the ILO, to the task of ensuring that the challenges of technological change and the transition to a low carbon economy are managed in ways that lead to working people enjoying better lives and a fair share of the wealth we create.As the OECD embarks on this work, we hope to keep two questions in mind.  First, who owns technology, who gets the benefits of change—the people of the OECD or a handful of billionaires?”   Second, what happens when developed countries are unwilling or incapable of seeing to it that the needs of the majority of the people are met, that the public benefits from technological change?  What are the social consequences? What are the political consequences?  Can democracy survive in such an environment?Technological change is a constant feature of modern life. Because technological change is the product of working peoples’ inventiveness and working peoples’ money. Just to take one example--every single one of the technological innovations built into an iPhone was developed using public money.Technological progress should drive increasing productivity, and increasing productivity should drive higher wages. This was the story of the post-war boom in OECD member states. But this virtuous cycle only happens when there are tight labor markets, when workers have real voice and real bargaining power, and most importantly, when governments see rising incomes for working people as a good thing, not a bad thing.When technological change is combined with austerity, mass unemployment and government policies designed to accelerate a downward spiral in wages—a handful of wealthy investors will capture the wealth technological change creates, and the already a serious crisis of democracy in OECD countries will worsen.  Fundamentally, I believe we all agree the key issue is jobs. But we would be making a terrible mistake if we think just any jobs will lead to better lives for working people. The people of the countries of the OECD expect their governments to pursue policies that will lead to jobs that provide rising incomes and economic security. We expect productivity gains to lead to good jobs—as such gains have throughout the modern era. And we utterly reject the idea that somehow government policies that encourage falling wages and a fundamental power imbalance between employers and workers can somehow be fixed on the back end by redistributive policies.  As long as market capitalism has existed, it has been clear that labor markets without robust labor market institutions and progressive government involvement result in imbalances that both cause economic and political crisis. Simply put, deregulated labor markets cannot deliver good jobs, economic or political stability. The United States is the poster child for unregulated labor markets. The result has been wage stagnation, falling public investment and public disenchantment with democracy itself. Recently Harvard University polled Americans born after 1980—millennials—and asked them if democracy was necessary for a good society. Only a third said it was. And fully 24% said democracy was an obstacle to having a good society.But for technological change to lead to better lives for most people we need not just well-structured labor markets, we need firms that can help shape and support these outcomes. Quality jobs require quality businesses, quality CEOs, quality corporate governance, long-term business models that shift away from financial short-termism.We need policies that drive these positive models forward both in global supply chains and also in digital business—both areas where the boundaries between individual firms, and between firms and employees, often become blurred, threatening a situation where no one is responsible for the fair treatment and economic security of working people. Yet the digital work environment creates an imbalance in information between workers and employers creates power imbalances as great as those of the age of the robber barons.Perhaps most relevant to the work of the OECD, productive firms require fair and thoughtful corporate tax policies. The OECD’s work promoting multilateral coordination on tax policy in recent years, particularly the BEPS process, is among the best work we have seen from the OECD. This work needs to be expanded and strengthened. But I must observe that in the recently released Economic Outlook instead the staff is lending intellectually embarrassing political support to the Republican tax plan—a plan that is completely contrary to the OECD’s values and goals in that it encourages international tax evasion, shifts the tax burden in a regressive direction and incurs vast deficits in the process. The idea that it will meaningfully add to U.S. economic growth is ridiculous and yet that is what the Economic Outlook says. We urge the OECD to focus on continuing its work against tax havens and tax evasion rather than trying to appease those who benefit from such abuses.Finally, on the subject of firms, we know that there has been a lot of talk about inequality among firms—that somehow the problem of economic inequality is due to some firms being so much better than other firms. Let me be clear, we see this type of argument as a way to avoid the real issues. While the labor movement wants all firms to be above average, we do not want to postpone the conversation about inclusive growth and worker bargaining power until we reach that impossible goal.So ahead of our conversation this afternoon, let me share a couple of final thoughts to help guide the conversation.If the future is not going to be grim both economically and politically, change in the workplace, within industries, nationwide, must be bargained, and bargained collectively. Better access to skills and education matters—indeed it is critical. But conversations about education are a debased currency because for too long policymakers who actually wanted workers’ power to erode and our incomes to fall have always tried to change the subject to education whenever we pointed out that our lives were getting worse and our members were losing confidence in democracy. Fundamentally the erosion of the bargaining power of the working people is the root cause for productivity not being shared and for rising inequalities. The implications for the OECD are this: stop with recommendations that weaken collective bargaining, lower the minimum wage and weakens unemployment insurance, and stop with the double standard where the OECD refers to the employer community and the investor community, but then talks about solutions for workers as if we can make it on our own as isolated individuals.  We face an imminent threat of competitive wage cutting by OECD countries that, if allowed to move forward will both lead to macroeconomic and political catastrophe. Instead of marching inexorably toward a crisis using code words like “structural reform” and “flexibility,” we must get serious about protecting democracy by building social solidarity.We don't need more global rules, but better ones, if we want to avoid the political collapse of multilateralism. The labor movement stands for multilateralism, rest assure. But our support is for a system that addresses both today’s topic—the world of work, and the world of businesses—and to fill in the regulatory gaps between jurisdictions. We are not there. We have missed opportunity after opportunity to ensure a minimum level of policy coherence between trade rule and labor standards and to balance the right of investors with the rights of the ordinary people. Time has run out.Let me close by talking about democracy. Next year, the TUAC will celebrate its 70th anniversary. The TUAC was founded in March 1948 at a trade union conference in London on the Marshall Plan. Let me quote the final statement: we the labor movement “will contribute to the establishment of the economics, social and political conditions which are essential to safeguard the principles of free citizenship and democratic institutions, and which above all can ensure a progressive improvement in the life and labour of the people.” Today, the labor movement stands united behind these fundamental principles. We restate this commitment in the face of rising anti-democratic forces and after a generation of neo-liberalism has left ordinary people believing democracy means inequality, poverty and rising economic insecurity. Last June I called upon the OECD to “be in the business of helping people build democratic institutions that give them economic and political voice—guardians of equality and democracy.” OECD membership and the OECD vision of inclusive growth must be about democratic institutions, about rule of law for all, about independent judiciary, about ordinary people, trade unionist and activist not fearing arbitrary ruling and detention. That matters for current members of the OECD and for those that aspire to become members. Let me close with this. Events of the last few years should have made clear that the alternative to a just society is not the libertarian paradise of Silicon Valley billionaires. It is a racist and authoritarian nightmare. The labor movement hopes the OECD will be a strong voice for a just global order where technological change leads to better lives for ordinary people and against the looming threat of racist authoritarianism.Thank you for your attention and let’s now begin our afternoon conversation.

259,Tefere Gebre Accepts the Irish National Caucus World Peace Prize,https://aflcio.org/speeches/tefere-gebre-accepts-irish-national-caucus-world-peace-prize,12-5-2017,"I want to thank the World Peace Prize Council, Father McManus and Barbara for all you do and for thinking of me for this honor. Thank you, Reverend Dr. Han Min Su for your vision and kind words. Also a special thank you to President Boland for your introduction. Jim you have been a true and supportive friend, going back before I was elected to this office. I want you to know how much I value that friendship.And thank you to everyone who took a pause from your busy day and being a witness as I receive this highly underserving honor. I especially want to thank my assistant, the incomparable Francine Thompson, who takes care of Mike and I every day.Brothers and sisters: As I was thinking of what to say today, I was reminded by a great philosopher called Mike Cavanaugh who said, “peace is not just the absence of conflict.” Then I started to think ""what is peace?""As you heard in my intro, I know what it is like to live in conflict, war and injustice. When I was growing up in Ethiopia, I didn’t know anything but war, conflict and injustice. I just want you to imagine what began in 1976, when Mengistu Haile Mariam took control of the military dictatorship and ousted Emperor Haile Selassie, and lasting until 1984, an estimated 500,000 to 750,000-- mostly teenagers and young adults of high school and college age--were murdered, tortured or just disappeared in Ethiopia. That’s when, at the age of 13, I started dreaming of peace. That is the reason I, and millions like me, leave their homes and migrate in search of peace.Today, as I stand before you, the world is less JUST to be peaceful. Especially if you are a migrant like I used to be. Even worse, searching for that imagined peace, one can end up being enslaved. I am talking about real slavery here.As some of you may have seen, I watched footage that shows an auctioneer standing in front of a group of young men, shouting: “Big strong boys for farm work. 400? 700? 800?""It is now clear that slavery is an outrageous reality in Libya.The auctions are reminiscent of one of the darkest chapters in human history when millions of Africans were uprooted, enslaved, trafficked and auctioned to the highest bidder.We need to fight for peace today more than ever. But what does that mean? As Mike reminded me peace is not the absence of conflict, peace only happens when we all rise up for justice. There can’t be any a real peace until we find justice for millions of immigrant workers here in the U.S. and the hundreds of million workers around the world. There can’t be real peace until black men and women are free to drive to work without the fear of being shot and killed by cops.We eliminate the kafala system in the Middle East that denies workers their basic freedoms.We must restore democracy here at home and ensure one person, one vote.In the labor movement, we have known for a long time that peace can’t exist without justice. That's why we say, ""No justice, no peace. No justice. No peace.""

260,"Trumka Praises ""Better Deal"" for Working People",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-praises-better-deal-working-people,11-1-2017,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka made the following remarks at a press conference unveiling the labor proposals in Congressional Democrats' ""Better Deal"" platform.Last week, the AFL-CIO held our convention in St. Louis. We listened to working people and came together around a bold agenda that will improve the lives of all working families.And today, we’re here to talk about how the Democrats have also listened and responded with a true workers’ rights agenda as part of the “Better Deal.”I want to thank Leader Schumer and Leader Pelosi and everyone up here today with us. These are true champions of working people at a time when too many politicians have lost their way. We see their leadership every day, and it has led to these very important proposals.I’m proud to stand with them as the Democratic Party embraces strengthening unions and expanding collective bargaining as a core value and necessary element of a fair and growing economy and a strong democracy.In the labor movement, we’re ready to take on the challenges of our time and we’re building the unified and diverse movement to do it. We’re devoting more resources to organizing and building new alliances. We’re leading with our issues and engaging working people at every level, every day.But we also know that the law is going to have to change so there’s a level playing field to do it. I can tell you countless stories about how our current labor law has completely failed working people. How employers see taking away rights from workers as simply a cost of them doing business. And how there is a coordinated, well-funded attack on the freedoms of working people from the state level to the Supreme Court.Changing the rigged rules of our economy by uniting behind the labor proposals in the “Better Deal” is the right step forward. Not only for the labor movement, but for the Democratic Party, for our country and for our economy.To be perfectly honest, Democrats in the past in some ways have lost their connection with working people and our communities who have made up their base for generations. But each time one of these policies pass that bond will become stronger and stronger. And that’s why today’s set of proposals have to be more than just proposals. Improving the lives of working families has to be the fundamental basis for which Democrats fight. I’m confident the Democratic leaders here today will do just that and we’re ready to do our part to make real policy change.On behalf of working people everywhere, I want to say to the leaders here thank you for listening. Thank you for responding. And thank you in advance for waging the battle to make workers’ lives better in the future. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
261,AFL-CIO 2017 Convention: Working People Need a Bill of Rights,https://aflcio.org/speeches/afl-cio-2017-convention-working-people-need-bill-rights,10-25-2017,"Richard Trumka, AFL-CIO President:We’ve covered a lot of ground over the past four days. We’ve passed important resolutions. We’ve debated urgent issues. We’ve heard from incredible speakers. This next segment brings it all together. As we’ve discussed throughout the convention, the rules of our economy have been written so corporations win and working people lose. This assault on our rights and freedoms is bad for our families, our communities and our democracy. 
When the rules have been rigged against us for so long… when we keep working harder for less... when corporations and politicians continue to chip away at our health care and retirement… when forming a union feels like climbing a mountain... it can be hard to know the next right step. I think it’s time to get back to basics. The policy agenda and political accountability measures passed this week put us on a path to the change we need. What’s missing is a clear, concise statement of rights that captures our aspirations.Sisters and brothers, working people need a bill of rights.A collective bargaining agreement for America. This will serve as a platform for our members to rally around. It will give prospective members a clear statement of our values. And it will provide political candidates and elected officials with a litmus test for our support. We simply refuse to accept the reality of struggling to make ends meet in the richest country in the world at its richest point in history. And so we demand rights that ensure we are able, through our work, to lead better lives.Let me know turn it over to Liz Shuler. Liz Shuler, AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer:Thank you, Rich. This is an idea whose time has come. We recently conducted a survey of working people and three quarters of respondents said they should have a bill of rights. And for good reason.  Employers and politicians are conspiring to hold down wages.Outdated labor laws are making it harder and harder to form a union. Young people are graduating college with mountains of debt, if they can afford to go at all. Women are still being paid less than men for doing the same job.Of the people we surveyed, a third do not have health insurance. Three in four do not have a pension. We can and must do better.Throughout the week, we’ve  spoken to delegates about what a Workers Bill of Rights would mean to them. Let’s see what they had to say. Tefere Gebre, AFL-CIO Executive Vice President:As you can see from that video, there is a lot of enthusiasm for guaranteeing every work basic freedoms and protections. So at this time, I’d like to briefly outline the components of our proposed Workers’ Bill of Rights.Sisters and brothers, we urge the labor movement to mobilize in coordination with all who share our values to make this bill of rights a reality for all working people.I’d now like to call on Cecil Roberts, Chair of the Resolutions Committee, to move the resolution. Cecil Roberts, UMWA President:Thank you, Tefere. And thank you Rich and Liz. It is fitting that the Workers’ Bill of Rights is Resolution 1, because it includes all of our primary goals as labor movement. I strongly encourage the delegates to pass this resolution and use it as a tool to support our organizing and political work.So on behalf of the Resolutions Committee, which recommends adoption, I move Resolution 1.

From growing unions to rewriting the economic rules to securing justice and fairness for all.All of this is important. All of it is close to my heart, and to yours. Today we’re going to talk about the thing that brings it all together: people.As workers, we aren’t asking for the world. We want to go to work and come home safely at the end of the day. We want to be paid enough to support ourselves and our families. We want health care for when we get sick, time off to do with what we please, a schedule that is flexible and fair, and protection from discrimination. Finally, after decades of hard work, we want to retire with dignity and security.We live in the richest country in the world at its richest point in history, yet too many of us are still working harder for less—the result of economic rules written of, by and for the wealthiest few. We can choose to do better.Today we will offer a bold solution for restoring fairness and balance to our economy: The Workers’ Bill of Rights.I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again: inequality is not inevitable. Inequality is a choice—and it is a choice that too many politicians and special interests have made.We can choose to do better. And a comprehensive bill of rights can help us get there.The best way to raise wages, it’s really no contest at all, is when workers use our power to bargain with employers. Nothing else raises wages better or more fairly. Nothing else gives working people a chance at a secure retirement.There has never been a more important time for workers to assert our collective power, because the balance of power has shifted away from working people for too long.All workers, every single worker in America, should have a say in their pay and working conditions.We want to bust the doors to unionism wide open!That’s how we will start to close that gap between the too-rich and the rest of us. That’s how we will expand the economy, not with lousy jobs but with good jobs that sustain a family and elevate millions into the middle class.Unionism works.America is hungry for it—our adversaries know this, which is why they spend a fortune to stop us.We’ll fight for it. We’ll stand for it. We’ll win it, brothers and sisters, because unions have never backed down from a good fight. It is what we were built to do.We’ll lock arms, shoulder to shoulder, side by side. We’ll fight today, tomorrow, and we’ll stay at it, as long as it takes. We will not be denied!

263,Shuler to AFL-CIO 2017 Convention: I believe we can shape the future,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-afl-cio-2017-convention-i-believe-we-can-shape-future,10-24-2017,"Let's talk about the future.The future of work. The future of the global economy. And the future of the labor movement.And while this is sometimes presented as a ""new"" discussion...the fact is that workers and unions have been adapting to changes in the workplace, including technology shifts and evolving employment models, throughout our history.  Of course, we have always fought for good jobs and job security at the bargaining table, and we fight for skills training so that working people can move into the jobs of the future.We fight for economic policies that protect good jobs and help transition displaced workers.We problem solve with employers at joint labor management tables. We organize workers in emerging industries. We embrace new technology.Innovation and cutting edge advancements that improve products, services and lives. But we do so with the belief that if we get ahead of emerging trends we stand a chance of assuring the aspirations of working people is what drives the transformation of our economy.The challenge is whether we can make another seismic shift to adapt to the digitalization of work and what's been called the ""4th Industrial Revolution.""  It's not just about robots and automation...it's about whether we will watch corporations hollow out employment relationships and middle class careers, or whether we will shape the future of work.  I believe we can shape the future.  It will require bold action, risk taking, and, as always, joining, fighting, winning together. To shape the future...we have to confront these basic questions: How do we make sure that working people have the bargaining power to shape changes in the workplace and counter growing inequality of wealth and power?How do we extend the rights and protections of employees–in particular bargaining rights to more workers in the new economy?How do we ensure that working people share in the gains from technological advances, including automation and digitalization?How do we grow, how do we reverse the decline in union density, and put upward pressure on work arrangements that lower labor standards?How can we improve the way the labor movement is structured, the way we communicate with all working people, and the way unions use new bargaining strategies to meet these challenges?We will not answer all those questions in the next 30 minutes...but we do have a plan of action for the labor movement to up our game, to rise to the challenge and confront these difficult questions head on.  Shortly we will present to the Convention a resolution for the AFL-CIO to form the Commission on the Future of Work and Unions so that this important work can begin with deep sectoral analysis and a plan of attack. Together we will embrace the urgency of this moment and ready the labor movement.We will lift up the powerful principle...that new, different and innovative sectors of our economy and more middle class jobs...are fueled by real bargaining power and strong unions. In this challenging time, we have an opportunity to come together to shape the future of work as an unmistakable force for broadly shared prosperity!This conversation about the future of work is happening literally all over the world including the International Labor Organization and the World Economic Forum.  Our global partners are having the same debate and are asking the same questions. We know the decline in union density around the world is linked to growing inequality and impacts how much bargaining power we will have in the future world of work.  We have to work together more closely than ever to ensure race and gender pay gaps in so many countries are closed; that we protect migrant workers and grow sustainable jobs in a greener economy.

264,Trumka to AFL-CIO 2017 Convention on Politics: Our support must be based on issues,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-afl-cio-2017-convention-politics-our-support-must-be-based-issues,10-24-2017,"Good morning brothers and sisters. I want to thank all of you that participated in yesterday's activities. In one afternoon, we demonstrated the scope and power of the labor movement.Yesterday's right to work canvass and phone bank is a reminder of what we like to call ""common sense economics.""It's the simple idea that the economy is not like the weather. It doesn't just happen to us. The economy is nothing but a set of rules. The rules are written by the men and women we elect.Those rules decide the winners and the losers, and for nearly four decades, they've been written to ensure working people are the losers.Policy is what shapes the economy, and too many of those policies have produced a windfall for the rich and the well-connected and doomed millions to compete for the scraps left over. Brothers and sisters, this must end. Our movement is the great equalizer in an otherwise cruel economy.If the question is, how do we correct this rigged economy? The answer is simple: through strong unions and more bargaining power.Over the next several hours, we are going to debate several important resolutions focused on rewriting the rules so they work for working people. And we are going to discuss how we use politics to help us get there. A number of weighty and challenging issues are on the docket today:Health care: How do we continue to protect what we have but also win what we need?Budget and taxes: How do we win investment and tax policies that put working people first?Global organizing: How do we change the rules to lift up workers around the world?Future: How do we arm our movement with the structures and the power to build an economy that promotes broadly shared prosperity?And finally, Wall Street: How do we ensure Wall Street serves Main Street, not the other way around? I will have more to say about this later. We're going to finish the morning with a debate about politics. I want to say a few words about that right now. Brothers and sisters, we have many champions in the Democratic Party. And we have a few good friends in the Republican Party. But the truth is this. The number of Republicans who support us has gone down. And the number of Democrats who disappoint us has gone up. That's why the labor movement must be an independent political voice. We will find hope and opportunity for millions of working people, not inside the major political parties, but inside our movement and our communities.I don't care if you're a Democrat, a Republican, or anything in between...if you do right by us, we will do right by you. Our support must be based on issues --not personalities and certainly not party registration. As I said at the beginning, the economy is nothing but a set of rules. The men and women we elect write those rules --they believe either they are in office to elevate working people or they don't.So let us elect candidates who share our vision.Strong unions.Raising wages.Health care for all. Quality Public Education. Modern Infrastructure. American-made energy. Voting rights. Civil rights. Worker rights. Let us go into 2018 and 2020 as one united movement ready to boost worker champions no matter the letter next to their name. That's how we change the rules. That's how we build an economy that works for all of us. Thank you.

265,Trumka to 2017 AFL-CIO Convention: Attack on Unions a Threat to Democracy,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-2017-afl-cio-convention-attack-unions-threat-democracy,10-23-2017,"Thank you, Liz. Good morning brothers and sisters. I hope you got some rest. We have a busy day ahead of us. And a canvass this afternoon!I’d like to begin with a video.As you can see, the attacks against us are relentless.And they are taking a toll.Listen to this: A Harvard University study showed that only 30% of millennials believe it’s essential to live in a democratic nation. 30%!I believe the findings of this poll are directly related to the video we just watched.Think about it: what has been the result of the attacks on working people? -Lower Wages-Less Opportunity-More Inequality-Social Unrest-And a feeling that the economy is riggedMillennials have never lived in an America where wages are growing, or worked in an economy where hard work and productivity blazed a trail into the middle class. They have never experienced an economy where more than 1 in 10 workers have the freedom to belong to a union and bargain together. The American idea that anything is possible if you work hard and play by the rules simply does not exist for many young people. In other words, the attacks on the backbone of our nation—working people—constitutes nothing less than a clear and present danger to our democracy. So we are going to fight back. Smartly. Strategically. As one united movement. That is the primary focus of today’s session. We are going to fight back against right to work, here in Missouri and across the country. We are going to fight back against attacks on our wages, benefits and freedom to negotiate for good jobs. And we are going to fight back against the right-wing propaganda machine that continues to slander unions and our members.We’re going to do it by organizing. In the face of right to work and Janus, we are laser focused on building enduring relationships with our members. That means engaging directly with them—and not just during election time. We need to listen to our members. We need to find out what they care about. We need to learn what makes them tick. And we need to remember most people work to live rather than live to work. We also need to remember that right to work does not take collective bargaining rights away from a single worker. And it does not force a single union member to stop paying dues unless they choose to. In other words, right to work cannot and should not stop us from doing our job—organizing new members, engaging with current ones and providing the best representation in the world. That is, brothers and sisters, how we toss the destructive and morally bankrupt right to work principle into the scrap heap where it belongs.

Today we will highlight some great examples of this work.We’re also going to fight back by being on the front lines of today’s civil rights struggles. Immigrant rights. Equal pay. LGBTQ equality. Voting rights. The right to form a union freely and fairly. I’ve said this many times and I’ll say it again today. When it comes to civil rights, we cannot afford to be in the middle of the pack. We must be the tip of the spear. Later today, my friend AFSCME President Lee Saunders will talk about the upcoming 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.  Dr. King gave his life speaking out for striking sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee.And he reminded us that right to work is a false slogan, designed to rob us of our civil rights and job rights.The anniversary of Dr. King’s death is a reminder that there will forever be a bond between job rights and civil rights —that our struggles are not separate but in fact linked both by history and today’s profound struggles. So the question we must ask ourselves is this: how will we respond?Brothers and sisters, the answer is right in front of our face. This movement is the single greatest force for good for America. We give voice to the voiceless.We fight for a fair and just economy.We protect the public services that make our country good and decent.And we make sure no one is left behind. We’re ready for a fight. Our opponents are bold. They’re well-funded and ruthless – but their North Star is greed, ours is solidarity and fairness. Well, we've taken their best shot and we're still standing. Unions are here to stay. We’re ready to join together, fight together and win together. America is counting on us. So let’s get to work.Thank you.

It is my greatest honor to serve as your Executive Vice President. Thank you, President Marc Perrone, for your nomination. I am proud to be a part of the UFCW family. And thank you Jorge Ramirez and Sara Nelson, two great friends and champions for workers. Sisters and brothers, these are tough times. For our country. For our movement. For our communities.Good jobs are still too few. Wages are still too low. Tensions are growing.Between black and white. Between immigrant and native-born. But even in the face of these challenges, I have hope.Hope of a brighter day. Hope of a stronger tomorrow. Hope of an America with liberty and justice for all. Sisters and brothers, this is a job for the labor movement! We can bring our country together! I pledge to do my part. To lead with my heart. To never stop fighting.When I was walking across the Sudanese desert, when hope was nearly lost, when death seemed imminent...America opened its arms to me.Sisters and brothers, we must open our arms to America. Every sector. Every community. Every background. From the refugee who sorts the trash to the immigrant housekeeper. From the white man working harder for less to the black woman still earning only 67 cents on the dollar.We MUST be the movement for all of America. All of us or none of us. Our survival as a labor movement and a nation depends on it.When we come together, when we unite as one...wages will go up...inequality will go down...jobs will improve. But this will not happen on its own. We have to work hard for it. We have to practice what we preach. Dr. King reminded us that the time is always right to do the right thing.So LET'S DO IT! The emerging majority has already emerged. The future is now. We can be the home for immigrants and people of color. We can guarantee equal pay for women. We can protect LGBTQ workers from discrimination. We can make the labor movement more progressive. And the progressive movement more pro-labor. Remember, the vast majority of Americans are with us. They want a voice at work. They want more jobs and schools. Not more jails and tax cuts for the rich. They want voting rights and immigrant rights and free press rights. They want trade that works, health care that cares and a justice system that is just. Once again, I say: this is a job for the labor movement! Our opponents want to tear us apart. But we MUST NOT let them! This is our moment. We know what to do. ORGANIZE!Educate and Organize. Mobilize and organize. Galvanize and organize. Organize. Organize. Organize.Hold our elected leaders accountable. Make our case with passion and determination. That's why I joined this movement. That's why we fight. To build a better America. For our members. For our founders. For our nation. For my daughter.This is our responsibility as we build the labor movement of the future!Thank you very much.

267,Liz Shuler Acceptance Speech at the AFL-CIO 2017 Convention,https://aflcio.org/speeches/liz-shuler-acceptance-speech-afl-cio-2017-convention,10-22-2017,"Thank you so much. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your vote.It’s been an honor serving as your Secretary-Treasurer and I look forward to another four years with my partners Rich and Tefere. To my brother Lonnie Stephenson, thank you for nominating me. I would not be standing here without the love and support of my IBEW family. To Lorretta Johnson and Cindy Estrada, two fierce sisters, thank you for seconding my nomination. I am truly honored. You all know I’m a proud IBEW member -- and electricians who travel sometimes joke that IBEW stands for “I’ve Been Every Where.”  Since you elected me in 2009, our work together really has taken me everywhere. (And my husband Dave can attest to that...thank you honey). Yes, everywhere...celebrating with people who found the courage to form a union… and crying with workers who just lost their jobs and families reeling from natural disasters. I've stood on the picket line … and walked the halls of Congress. Covered the 5 a.m. shift change to talk to members about campaigns.. and marched with student organizers at Yale…We are joined in work that contributes to something greater than ourselves...and I’ve been a part of some incredible high points in our movement. But, I’ve experienced some low points, too. I’ve talked with young people, women, people of color, immigrants and LGBTQ workers about the exclusions they’ve felt. I’ve listened to stories from union members working hard behind the scenes, eager to make their unions better, but frustrated by a culture that too often discourages taking risks.I’ve had my own failures, too. Some of the initiatives I put forward didn’t go as far or move as fast as I had hoped. There were setbacks and false starts. But that’s okay. I think we need to do that more: Try things, take risks and not be afraid to fail.That’s how we tripled the number of young worker groups since the last convention… that’s how we won a new multi-million dollar grant for apprenticeships in hospitality and manufacturing… and by taking risks, that’s how we transformed our entire federation under incredibly difficult circumstances.And, yet, brothers and sisters, standing in front of you today, I feel almost breathless. Breathless from the rate of change. My head is spinning as the world increasingly careens in unexpected turns. My head is spinning because we, the labor movement, aren’t moving as fast as the rest of the world. We’re not doing enough to get ahead of change and transform it into opportunity.Last week, we saw women raise their hands and their voices against sexual harassment. With two simple words, and in a matter of hours, women launched a national conversation about sexual assault and harassment in the workplace.We’ve seen people rise up in new ways against corporate greed…poverty wages ... racial injustice…illegal travel bans…bathroom bills…and attacks on our free press. These uprisings are organic, large scale and immediate. They relate to our lives both at work and in our communities.  And they are happening around us, often without us.What is our role when technology connects people at work, in communities and around the world, yet deepens inequality, threatens jobs and diminishes worker power?Google, Glassdoor and Facebook have more data on our members than we do!How do we fight for good jobs when they are increasingly automated or distorted as the nation’s social compact is under relentless attack?We have reached a tipping point -- just focusing on protecting what we have, is far more dangerous than taking risks.When automation threatens millions of jobs in the not-too-distant future...we can’t afford to be cautious.When millions of people use their power online to oust CEOs and advocate for change, we need to harness that activism and use it to build a massive movement of working people.Together we can build the support, leadership and encouragement for more unions to get in the game, experiment and find new strategies for success.We know we have a huge target on our back. We know what true worker power can do. We know how sustained, collective activism can literally change the world!So we do have to protect ourselves. And we will. We’ll mobilize our members, stop attacks on the basic rights of working people, argue our case before the Supreme Court and organize like never before! But we also have to ask ourselves: what are the new ways we can make unions relevant and indispensable to someone’s life? If we demonstrate our value to people…yes, with our contracts, but also through cutting edge training and education that helps them ladder up to better jobs…through the support they need outside their workplace…through the actions we take to improve communities, like responding to disasters and showing the union cares...if we demonstrate value, we become essential.And right to work becomes irrelevant, because workers will want to join us.Earlier, I said I was breathless. It’s because I feel the urgency of this moment. But I also feel energized by the challenge. What if we all left St. Louis with a commitment to accelerate our change…to be bold...and take risks like never before?WE ARE the most powerful force for working families on the planet…We built the middle class, won retirement security, created safe workplaces, and defined what a fair economy could look like for the free world. Today all of those protections are at risk.So we must be a beacon – not just debating the future of work but defining it. Not just building worker power but using it. Using it every day. For the next generation. For the working people who count on us. For the movement we love.Thank you.

268,Richard L. Trumka Acceptance Speech at the AFL-CIO 2017 Convention,https://aflcio.org/speeches/richard-l-trumka-acceptance-speech-afl-cio-2017-convention,10-22-2017,"Thank you.I’m humbled and honored.First, I want to thank Lee Saunders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees for nominating me, and Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, and my own president and brother from the coalfields, Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America, for seconding my nomination.I want to thank the delegates. It’s an honor for each of us to serve our labor movement. I want to thank my family. Please stand up. My wife Barb. My son Richard, his wife Jessica and my grandson Trey. Christie, Kyle and Ki. My sister and brother in law Fran and Alex. My godson Sean. And his kids Ally, Mackenzie and Madison.I also want to thank a number of people who aren’t here, but on whose shoulders I stand and in whose steps I have followed.My father was a lifelong coal miner who knew the value of solidarity. He’s gone from this world, but he’s with me every day. Thank you, dad, and God bless you, and my mother, too. I followed my father into the mines and into unionism, but from my mother I got my passion and fighting spirit.My family is my foundation, but my union gave me purpose, and a path. Jock Yablonski led the movement called Miners for Democracy back in the 1960s when I was coming into unionism. Jock gave his life to turn the UMWA in a democratic and worker-led union. Without him I wouldn't be standing here today. There was George Holupka, my mentor who took me under his wing. There was Phil Ferutti, who was killed standing next to me when a trip of coal cars slid backwards down the tracks. After he was crushed, I gave him CPR until the doctor declared him dead.People like Cecil Roberts, John Banovic, Jerry Jones, Carlo Turley, Paul Lemmon, Rich Barchesi and Bob Long. These were the people who raised me, who inspire me, and who taught me about unionism, and about life.The sense of solidarity and community went through everything. It was like that throughout my hometown, Nemacolin. If I’ve got a pension, I’d be thinking how can I get you a pension, too. And you. And you. And everybody. My high school teacher taught me to write sonnets and see beauty in a tough world. In fact, that wonderful woman said she saw in me a diamond in the rough. She did more than teach. She inspired.That’s a way of looking at the world that’s getting attention across America right now. It’s a kind of unionism and responsibility and solidarity that has been hard to find in America for a long, long time. It’s the idea that together we can build a ladder to a better life, and climb it.For too long, too many CEOs, special interests and extremists have kept us fighting over the bottom rungs of the ladder. All the while, they’ve been climbing higher and higher, and when they get to or near the top rung, they burn the whole thing down!Well, guess what? They’re not the real power in America. Workers are. WE ARE!And let’s not kid ourselves: things have gotten very tough in America for too many working people. Sinister forces have banded together with their political influence and their money to try to weaken the beating heart of a strong, independent labor movement and a thriving middle class that rises together.But the punches they’ve thrown at us haven’t deterred us—NO, they’ve inspired us to come together, to renew our bond and to have an honest conversation about how we strengthen the AFL-CIO and our unions.  We are ready for this fight—it may feel different and on some days more daunting—but my sisters and brothers, we will leave St. Louis on the right track and ready for what comes next.Over the past eight years, we have strengthened our unions so we can build new ladders up to the middle class. That’s what our movement has always been about—we’re in this movement for workers and our families. That’s why I fought for a better and more secure life for coal miners and why I ran for office. It is what drives me today.  Our labor movement is more unified, more focused, more fiscally sound… because of the work we’ve done together. Now we’re ready to write the next chapter. Because no matter what we hear from the naysayers, we ain’t done yet.Great working men and women, and tough union leaders and activists gave us what we have, and we’ll leave it all to the generations to come.We’ll come together. We’ll stand together. We’ll fight together.For good jobs.For expanded bargaining power.For fairness and justice for everyone.For an economy and a political system no longer rigged against us.And for a fiercely independent movement that is ready to give voice to all working people.Our union gives us strength. I’m not talking about the institutions. I’m talking about the unseen connection between you and me, between all of us and our members—between the factory worker, bus driver, teacher and nurse. It can’t be measured. It can’t be touched. But I can feel it. It’s like love. When it’s gone, nothing hurts worse, and when it’s there, everything is possible. Sisters and brothers, thank you for putting your trust in me once again. I am proud to stand before you and tell you we’re going to go forward toward a better day for all working people. Our opponents are tough. They’re well-heeled and ruthless. But their deep pockets can’t overcome our deep passion for a fairer and more just nation. I say, bring it on! America is hungry for change. Change doesn’t just happen—we will make it happen the same way our predecessors stared down the barrel of a harsh economic and political reality—and even guns—to form the labor movement.A new day. A better day. For you, and me. Our children and grandchildren.We’ll join together. We’ll fight together. We’ll win together, brothers and sisters, because we do the work. This is our country, and it’s high time that we took it back! Thank you! Thank you for the honor to serve another term as president of the AFL-CIO.Thank you. God bless you, God bless your families and members and all the work you do!

269,Trumka Touts Global Solidarity in Lead Up to AFL-CIO 2017 Convention,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-touts-global-solidarity-lead-afl-cio-2017-convention,10-21-2017,"Good morning brothers and sisters!I want to welcome you all here to St. Louis, Missouri. I know that for many of you, just getting here was quite a journey and required long lines and longer flights. Thank you for making such a big effort to join us at the 2017 AFL-CIO Convention.All of us in this room represent the beating heart of the global labor movement. Yet this movement is much bigger than we are.  It extends beyond this hall and past our international borders.We come from different countries and social and political realities, yet we share a deep belief that everyone who works for a living has our same basic economic interests and the same values. Workers here and around the world need decent work, and we need to be able to speak freely with a unified voice in our unions to win a life of dignity.And I am sure that many of you want to hear about how working people are responding to the administration of President Trump.Sadly,  during this past year, it has become clear that President Trump has no intention to follow through on the commitments he made to working people during his campaign.You can go down the list of promises and priorities,  from health care to trade,  infrastructure investment to tax cut proposals, and just about everything else, and you see an administration that sides every time, with the interests of Wall Street and the rich and powerful. And not with the working people of this country.You can see from the proposed cuts to funding for global engagement and the proposals to build walls … and limit the number of refugees and immigrants coming to our country … that this administration does not value the global community.As working people, we know the value of systems, whether in the workplace, our cities or towns,  our nation or the world.We don’t rely on vast wealth to make things happen. We count on integrity, on the rule of law,  on strong multilateral systems that ensure peace and security and the protection of rights.The attempt by this administration to weaken global engagement is hurting workers, the environment, and our ability to create a more just global economy.That’s why the AFL-CIO is deeply committed to continuing our work to strengthen the global labor movement. The need is as great as it ever has been, and so is our resolve.We will continue to build a strong effective movement that can fight for improved working conditions and for greater social justice.It won’t be easy. We need to take on the policies backed by all the money on Wall Street, and at the same time, we need to take on racism and right-wing populism, that is often linked to white nationalism.This racism, sexism and bigotry… is the worst kind of evil in our world, and does not represent the true values of America.Confronting and marginalizing the deep-rooted and ugly racism that continues to affect our country and this very city where we’re talking today, is critical to our movement’s agenda.As you may know,  today we will have a conference dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive movement, and we will continue that discussion throughout the convention.I hope you will join in the conversation, and share some of your own experiences and challenges in your efforts to overcome racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia.Brothers and sisters, you have arrived in a city that is rich with labor history. St. Louis was the site,  it is generally recognized, of the first general strike about 140 years ago in 1877. The strike began among railroad workers and quickly grew into a mass movement, with thousands of workers in a host of different industries.Those brothers and sisters—our founders—advocated for the 8 hour work day and an end to child labor.Today, St. Louis continues the fight for justice and workers’ rights. Our unions and allied organizations are working together every day to shape an agenda for greater equality.And that’s why every four years at the AFL-CIO convention  we recommit to our priorities. We come together to unify and strengthen our movement, so that we can continue together to improve the lives of working people.Our priorities include continued engagement in global organizing campaigns and a bold, forward-looking strategy to shape the future of work.Listen, when it comes down to it, we’re doing exactly the same thing the leaders of our movement did … so long ago here in St. Louis, and in so many cities and countries around the world.The economic rules today aren’t working for us. I don’t care if you pick bananas in Guatemala or sew shirts in Bangladesh, if you’re an autoworker in Detroit or Mexico City. We’re working harder and harder for less and less, because the rich and powerful have written the economic rules for too long.We’re ready to take it back. We’re ready to win what we need. We want work to pay. We want decent lives for ourselves and our children. We want a secure retirement and health care when we get sick.These aren’t luxuries. These are the basics, and they’re not too much to ask. We make the beds. We build the roads. We teach the classes and we lift the loads. We do the job. We never run and hide. We are the organized workers of the world and we will not be denied!Thank you. God bless you.  Thank you again for coming.  It’s great to have you.

270,Trumka to CBTU in St. Louis: The labor movement is here to stay,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-cbtu-st-louis-labor-movement-here-stay,10-20-2017,"Thank you, Brother Fred [Redmond], and thank you, Brother Lew [Moye], for your kind words, and congratulations to my fellow honorees Petee Talley and Martin Mathews. I’m humbled and honored to be in your company. We’re appreciate the leadership of CBTU President Terry Melvin, and how he stands up for fairness and equality. We are truly blessed with bright stars in our labor movement. I also want to say a few words about Lew Moye, who was tireless in his work to set up the AFL-CIO Commission on Racial and Economic Justice following the events in Ferguson three years ago. But calling Lew tireless is quite an understatement. I’d like to recognize his historical work organizing workers and bridging racial divides here in St. Louis, all the time he has given to our labor movement and all his years of service. You know, Lew Moye was one of the leaders of the 1978 fight here in Missouri against right-to-work, and thanks to his education and outreach the victory margin in the African American community was higher than even among union members as a whole. Please join me in a show of appreciation for Brother Lew! It was September 2014. I was scheduled to speak at the Missouri AFL-CIO convention here in St. Louis. The community was reeling from the death of Michael Brown and the protests that followed. I had a decision to make. I could give a standard speech about traditional union issues. Or I could address the wounds that have been haunting our nation and our movement for generations. To me, the choice was clear—civil rights and worker rights were one and the same. “Our brother killed our sister’s son,” I said to the convention. “This tragedy and all the complexities of race and racism are a big part of our family.” I called on labor to deal with those complexities openly and honestly.Three years have passed since the Ferguson tragedy, yet tensions in St. Louis remain high. There was another acquittal in a police shooting. The Missouri legislature has passed legislation lowering wages and undermining the freedom of workers to negotiate for a better life. The NAACP has issued a statewide travel advisory.We made the decision to bring our convention to St. Louis because it’s a proud union town with a tremendous history of activism. We are the community and the community is us. In fact, we’ve been on the ground in St. Louis confronting issues of social and economic justice for decades. The labor movement is here to stay.We live in a time of sharp divides here in America, and it’s hard. I won’t say it’s not. But when it comes to standing together, saying hard truths and fighting for what’s right, we won’t back down, not one damn inch! Thank you, sisters and brothers. God bless you and the work you do.

271,Trumka to Maritime Trades: Our Agenda Unites Us ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-maritime-trades-our-agenda-unites-us,10-20-2017,"Thank you, brothers and sisters, and thank you, President Sacco for your kind words of introduction. Congratulations on your re-election. Thank you for asking me to address your convention in this historic city. It’s great to be with you again. Mike, seeing you here brings to mind some union stories that have quite frankly become part of the history of the labor movement in Missouri and in America. I won’t go too deeply into them, partly because we don’t have the time and partly because some of these stories wouldn’t be fit to print, but I’m thinking of floating picket lines, riled up union members and all the organizing we did up and down these inland waterways. Brothers and sisters, Mike and I joined together with a spirit of true brotherhood. I learned a lot from Mike, and with him. We did a lot of good work together. The unions of the Maritime Trades Department, and your employers are no strangers to good work. I’m thinking of the MTD community service activities, your commitment to the Union Sportsmen’s Alliance and all the grassroots work out there, at every one of the 21 port councils in Canada and the United States from Seattle to Michigan to Southern California, collecting toys for kids at the holidays, cleaning the waterways, supporting our service men and women, raising money for the Leukemia & Society and providing scholarships to maritime students. Right here in St. Louis, I’ve been told all about the Port Council’s hard work and commitment to the We Are Missouri Campaign against right to work. In particular, I’ve heard great things about St. Louis Labor Council President Jack Martorelli out of the Operating Engineers. Way to go, Jack! Thanks for your hard work. God bless you. Sisters and brothers, we work. It’s what we do. It’s one of core values. Yet we work for a reason, and that’s to provide a decent life to our families, our communities and each other. We do what we do because we care deeply about each other. That’s where our commitment comes from. That commitment unites us. It’s powerful. It transforms us from a group of individuals into a union. Nothing is more powerful than working people united for a common goal. With our unity, we’re going to transform our nation. We’re going to take America back! It’s high time! It’s not too much to ask. We make the ships. We build the roads. We teach the classes and we lift the loads. We do the jobs. We never run and hide. We are North America’s labor movement, and we will not be denied! Over the past eight years, America’s labor movement has changed. We came out of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and it hasn’t been easy. Bad corporate trade deals have added insult to injury, killing jobs and lowering wages for working people. Yet our unions are not the same. We’ve undergone some necessary reforms. Some of it we’ve chosen to do. Some of it circumstances have forced upon us. But I can tell you, we’re more powerful than we used to be. And we won’t stop. As we settle in for the 2017 AFL-CIO Convention here in St. Louis, I find myself looking around at a labor movement that’s more focused, more unified, more intent on winning and more popular than we have been in a very long time. The latest Gallup poll shows 61 percent of Americans approve of unions—a 14-year high. Collective action is on the rise. More and more workers are standing together and confronting corporate power head on.

Brothers and sisters, we won’t stop. We won’t stop when politicians still use a hurricane as an excuse to attack the Jones Act! This cheap shot against American flagged vessels came at the exact time you and your union brothers and sisters were organizing aid for Puerto Rico, we were doing it ourselves, because the federal government refused to get the job done. Brothers and sisters, we will stand up for the Jones Act anytime, anyplace, anywhere! We won’t stop when politicians cut the pay of the poorest and hardest working people among us, as they did right here in St. Louis. The right-wing Missouri legislature actually passed legislation lowering the minimum wage pay back down to $7.70. That’s indefensible. We won’t stop. We’re focused on raising pay. We’re focused on growing unions, because the best way to win a raise and keep it is with a collective bargaining agreement. We’re focused on winning better jobs. Massive investments in infrastructure. We want new deeper ports. We won’t stop until we’re fully independent politically, so we play politicians against each other instead of keep getting played. We’ll win what we need with a political program that digs deeper and fights harder than we ever have before. We’ll win by putting forward powerful ideas like a Workers Bill of Rights that guarantees the freedom of everyone to join or form a union.Some might call it radical. I say it’s fundamental, because it’s time to fix the bottleneck keeping workers from negotiating with our employers. America is ready for it. We want more union cards in more union hands. The rich and powerful are on the march. They are well funded, well organized and out for blood. Well I say, bring it on! They’re on the march, but so are we. And I’ll take working men and women of America over the right-wing and Wall Street any day of the week. We’re not scared. When it comes to the attacks on our unions, we’ve let go of our fear. Fear never does us any favors.We will not fear the attacks against us in Canada or the United States. But we will fight them. We will aim to defeat every attack on the institutions of our labor movement and the values we hold dear—freedom, equality, justice, fairness and the rights to assemble and speak freely.And we will use every fight to organize internally, just as the We Are Missouri Campaign is doing right here right now, by engaging with our members and building relationships that can stand the test of any attack. That’s how we build real power for working people each and every day. That’s how we lift each other up. That’s how we make right to work irrelevant. It won’t be easy, but our agenda unites us. Safe jobs. Good pay. Health care. A secure retirement. And a better life for our kids. With an agenda like that, we can join together, rise together, fight together and win together! We’ll lock arms. We’ll stand strong. As far as it takes. As long as it takes. With solidarity. Real solidarity. Where your picket line is my picket line, and my picket line is your picket line. We won’t sit back or back down until we take America back! Brothers and sisters, listen close. If you remember one thing from my remarks today, remember this: We will not settle for merely surviving as a labor movement. That’s not enough. We will thrive!Every single day, the workers of your unions prove how powerful and effective we are. On both coasts, you’re building world-class ships, the best there is. All through these inland waterways, you move the goods that make our economy work. You’re moving trade across the oceans and around the world. We’re ready for the future. We’re ready to grow. Our unions will bring out the best in our country. And in ourselves. We’ll build the future we know we can have and we must have. And we will never, ever, give up. We will always, always, go forward. And together, we will win, for our children, for our families, for our future, for each other. That’s how we’ll go forward. That’s how we’ll win. Together! Together!Thank you! And God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
272,Trumka Weighs in on Latest Round of NAFTA Negotiations,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-weighs-latest-round-nafta-negotiations,10-12-2017,"Good morning. I’m Rich Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. Thank you for joining us today. We just finished an hour-long discussion of NAFTA's damage to working people. A few key points of consensus emerged: I want to be clear: the enemy of American workers is not Mexican workers. It’s not Canadian workers. And it’s not even corporations. The enemy of American workers is a broken system of trade that rewards corporate greed at our expense. NAFTA is the single greatest example of this broken system. It’s an economic disaster. And it must be fixed. Those of us here today—we’ve been at this awhile. Some of us have been sounding the alarm on NAFTA since the early-90s. Over the years, politicians from both political parties have promised to fix this unfair agreement. To date, none have delivered. We need a NAFTA that produces higher wages and better jobs and ends the era of outsourcing. The coalition you see here today; this is solidarity in action. It's not every country for itself.  It's workers standing together to raise the floor so we can all get ahead.  That starts in Mexico. Wages are low in Mexico because workers have no freedoms there. NAFTA was specifically designed to allow companies to profit on the backs of Mexican workers, driving down wages and standards for all of us. The government of Canada has put forth a more ambitious labor proposal better targeted to protect workers.The U.S. proposal doesn’t measure up.This is the test for this administration. They’re either going to step up for working people and produce labor rules that work.Or they stand with greedy global corporations who profit from exploitation.  Workers across North America demand a NAFTA that works for all of us. Thank you.  © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
273,Trumka to Charter/Spectrum Strikers: This is what solidarity looks like,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-charterspectrum-strikers-what-solidarity-looks-0,9-18-2017,"Thank you, brothers and sisters.It is great to be here today. The AFL-CIO has your back. We stand with IBEW Local 3! Your hard work has made Charter/Spectrum one of the most profitable cable companies in the United States. You did that! You aren’t asking for the world. You want a fair return on your work. You want good wages and a decent retirement. You want to provide for your families and enjoy the good things in life. That’s not too much to ask. So where the hell is the company?I have a message for Tom Rutledge: get to the table and negotiate a fair deal today. Tom took home $100 million last year. More power to him. We don’t begrudge CEOs that do well.We begrudge CEOs that do well and then ask us to pay more for health care and retirement. We begrudge CEOs that do well and then try to strip away our job security and overtime pay. That’s not right. It’s not fair. And workers will continue to exercise their right to strike until you give them a fair piece of the pie! IBEW has a long and proud history of partnering with employers to the benefit of business and labor.Your relationship with Time Warner spans decades.Cooperation is one thing. Retreat is another. We will not retreat in the face of corporate greed.I am proud of every single one of you. Going on strike takes tremendous sacrifice.   And I am encouraged by all of the unions here today.Public and private. Big and small.This is what solidarity looks like. We’re going to stand together. Arm in arm. For as long as it takes. We are the labor movement—and no one pushes us around.Thank you! God bless you! Keep up the fight! © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
274,Trumka on DACA: We won't back up or back down,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-daca-we-wont-back-or-back-down,9-6-2017,"Brothers and sisters! Welcome to Washington! It’s fitting for us to come outside and stand together. The rallies this week have been powerful! The protests this summer have been massive! The protests and marches and rallies this year are transforming our nation and will change America forever for the better. We’re taking our country back from those who want to divide us and keep us poor. We’re taking it back! Listen, like almost everyone in our labor movement and in this nation, my family story in America begins with immigration. I am the son of immigrants, and the grandson of immigrants, and I am proud of my heritage, just as I am proud of every DREAMer in America, and every immigrant who applied for and received Temporary Protected Status under the DACA and TPS programs. Two weeks ago, President Trump gave freedom to a convicted criminal named Sheriff Joe Arpaio who scorned the rule of law and trampled on the U.S. Constitution. Now President Trump is taking freedom from law-abiding and hard-working aspiring Americans who want nothing more than to live under and abide by the Constitution of the United States. President Trump and Congress should celebrate the contributions of immigrants, not assault them. I want to be crystal clear: When President Trump takes fundamental rights and freedoms from DREAMers and TPS recipients, he’s taking fundamental rights and freedoms from all of our families, from all of our brothers and sisters, and from all of us. The American labor movement rejects racism and discrimination in all its forms, because they violate our core values, destroy the fabric of our communities, terrorize upstanding people and degrade our nation. We won’t stand for it. We’ll rise up against it. We’ll stand together, rally together, march together, vote together and win together! Arm-in-arm. Shoulder-to-shoulder. We won’t back up or back down! We’re taking our country back! © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
275,Trumka Talks Union Advantage at Christian Science Monitor Labor Day Breakfast,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-talks-union-advantage-christian-science-monitor-labor-day-breakfast,8-30-2017,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the following remarks at the Christian Science Monitor's annual Labor Day breakfast:

Good morning. Thank you to the Christian Science Monitor for hosting this breakfast. And thank you all for being here. Happy Labor Day!The thoughts and prayers of the entire labor movement are with the people of Houston today. Our unions in Texas and across the country are mobilizing to help provide the assistance and raise the resources necessary to help that region rebuild and recover. We continue to stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in the Gulf Coast.As I begin, I also want to say a word about the job you do and the service you provide. Whether it’s covering a hurricane or an election, our democracy cannot survive without a free and fair press. Your access and credibility are being threatened by this administration and I just want to say how wrong I think that is. At the AFL-CIO, we are proud to represent workers in media and know firsthand the incredible dedication and sacrifice of America’s journalists. With all that said, feel free to grill me and I will fire right back. That’s how it’s supposed to work.Labor Day is an opportunity to both recognize the achievements of working people and identify areas for improvement.This year, we took a closer look at the tension between work and life, an issue that has always been a top concern of the American labor movement.Today, work and time off are badly out of balance.You’ve each received a copy of our new report that we are releasing for the first time here today: “Laboring on Labor Day.”Our survey found a nation overcome by work, as more and more Americans have hardly a moment to savor family, friends or relaxation.But we also found a distinct union difference. Union members polled were much more likely to receive Labor Day off, for example, and more likely to receive overtime pay if they were scheduled to work. Workers with a union contract are also more likely to have paid time off in general.Still, the vast majority of those polled reported working more holidays, taking fewer vacations and bringing more work home at night.This means less freedom. Freedom to take time off when you or a loved one gets sick, rest and recharge after giving birth, attend your child’s recital or sporting event, or just catch up on some household chores.Paid leave is just one area where our economic rules have been written to benefit corporations at our expense. Over the last several decades, the labor movement has faced a corporate and political onslaught like no other in history. The result has been flat wages, skyrocketing inequality and diminishing opportunity.When I started, I mentioned our democracy. Well, listen to this. A 2016 study showed that only 30 percent of millennials believe it’s essential to live in a democratic nation. At first, that statistic startled me. But as I started to absorb it, it actually made sense. Think about what young people have been forced to endure in their formative years. Historic economic inequality. Hateful rhetoric and division. Skyrocketing student debt. For this generation, the American idea that anything is possible if you work hard and play by the rules has been virtually nonexistent. And it is continuing to slip away from workers of all ages.Make no mistake, this crisis helped propel Donald Trump to the White House. Some working people, fed up with working harder for less—sick and tired of a political system that does not address their basic concerns—were willing to take a risk on Trump. But instead of a bold new direction, all workers have gotten is broken promises, outright attacks and dangerous, divisive rhetoric.So my message today is this: the change voters cried out for in the 2016 campaign can be found by standing together in unions.Simply put, union workers, empowered by the freedom to negotiate with employers—do better on every single economic benchmark. Union workers earn substantially more money. Union contracts help achieve equal pay and protection from discrimination. Union workplaces are safer. Union workers have better access to health care and a pension.And here is the good news: the popularity of unions is rising. A Pew survey shows 60 percent of Americans support unions and that number is even higher among millennials. And in our Labor Day poll, a majority of working people said they would vote to join a union tomorrow if given the opportunity.So let’s give them that chance—free from the employer interference and intimidation that has become all too common.Whether it’s raising wages, paid leave, gender and racial equality or simply the freedom to negotiate for a better life, unions are needed now more than ever. We can help deliver the economic rules working people are hungry for. That’s our focus and mission this Labor Day and beyond.Thank you for listening. I look forward to your questions.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

276,Trumka at AFT Rally: We're Ready For a Fight,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-aft-rally-were-ready-fight,7-19-2017,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the following remarks at an AFT rally opposing cuts to health care and education: Good afternoon, everybody! I’m Rich Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO! It is great to be here! Thank you, AFT, for organizing this event! Thank you, Randi Weingarten, for your friendship and your leadership.I also want to thank AFSCME President Lee Saunders and the Congressional champions who have joined us here today.  But most of all, thanks to all of you! Because you called, because you wrote, because you stood up and spoke out, Mitch McConnell’s health care sham has been stopped dead in its tracks. You did that! Today we’ve won an important fight, but the battle rages on. They’ll bring it up again, and again, and we’ll be right there to kill it every time! Because together, we are an unstoppable force. And if you think today’s victory feels good, you ain’t seen nothing yet. All of us up here—all of you out there—and tens of millions of us all over America—we are a team.We look out for each other. That’s what the labor movement is all about. How many teachers do we have here today?Let’s hear it for our teachers. Each and every one of you are heroes. You lift our children up. You keep our communities strong. You make our country go. Now, since this is a teach in, I decided to put together a short lesson plan for Republican leaders in Congress. Lesson 1: Kicking people off insurance and cutting taxes for rich people is not a health care plan. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from workers to Wall Street and we oppose it in any form! Lesson 2: Great countries don’t cut billions of dollars from public education. Remember, a budget is more than a set of numbers. It’s a statement of our values. So what does it say when we treat our teachers and students as a line item? America deserves better! Lesson 3: When you bring policies forward that give workers more freedom to provide for our families, we’ll help you pass them with the same strength and intensity we are using to stop this health care sham! We don’t want to be playing defense. Give us something to fight for!  And that brings me to our final lesson: If you continue down the path of trickle down—of health care for the few—of union busting and school vouchers—of corporate handouts and a race to the bottom—we will remember in November. Either work with us or we will elect someone who will. We’re ready for a fight. Our opponents are bold. But we’re bolder. They’re strong. But we’re stronger. We’re locking arms. We’re pushing forward. This is our day. This is our time. We are the American labor movement and we will not be denied! Thank you, all. God bless you! © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
277,Shuler Lays Out Broad Vision at Washington State Labor Council Convention,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-lays-out-broad-vision-washington-state-labor-council-convention,7-18-2017,"Thank you, Jeff (Johnson), for that introduction.It is an absolute joy to be back in the Northwest, and here with you this morning—and how do you follow a speech like that by Jeff Johnson? I’d like to thank Jeff for his leadership and supreme competence—and having a brilliant Secretary-Treasurer in Lynne Dodson makes for a powerhouse team. You’re surrounded by phenomenal staff and it’s great to see the Washington State Labor Council thriving…and thanks to Shannon Walker and the SW Washington CLC. It’s so great to see so many friends and some of my mentors from years past…and it's hard to believe it’s been almost 20 years since I was a delegate sitting in the same seats you all are in now!With everything that's been going on, has anyone else been doing any soul searching lately?I was at a family BBQ over the weekend, and I can't tell you how many people I talked to, who were like, “Hi! Wow…oh yeah…how are you doing? And they have this look of pity, and they say, “You union people are toast…you must be freaking out.” Anyone relate to that? And I got to thinking, yes, it’s really hard to be in the labor movement at this moment. But if you think about our history…has it EVER been EASY to be in the labor movement? And now is the perfect time to remember why we are in this movement in the first place. Really…why are you sitting here? Why are you resisting and persisting? It’s because we care about what happens to people. People we love…and people we will never meet. We resist and persist because every person deserves a fair shot and a fair shake in America. And because unions are the single greatest force for economic justice in the history of man and womankind. All of us have taken different paths to our activism. I’ve known about the power of unions since a very young age. I grew up in Milwaukie, Oregon, about 25 miles from this very hotel. In fact, I had the pleasure of spending this past weekend with my father who still lives in the house I grew up in. He actually was born in Appalachia in the hollers of North Carolina and his family worked in farm work (tobacco…and a little moonshine). They moved to Oregon when he was 10 chasing work in the orchards of Hood River—he, his parents, and his four siblings all lived in a one-room, fruit pickers cabin. And he got his first paying job at age 12 sandblasting tombstones to pay for dental care he needed. He enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school and was sent straight to Vietnam. When he returned, he needed a job. And he got lucky…he was hired at Portland General Electric as a grunt on a line crew and through hard work, he earned a spot in the local union lineman's apprenticeship. He became a journeyman and was able to earn a decent living to support our family and send his kids to college.My dad was like most union members. He went to work every day, did his job, paid his dues, showed up for important union meetings and the contract vote. He didn’t live to work. He worked to live. I worked at that same utility during summers while in college, and my mother worked there too. It was back when companies were like family, and jobs passed between the generations. The power linemen were in the union, but the clerical workers weren't. And I noticed that the company treated the union people differently…better…with a measure of respect. That stayed with me. After I graduated college, I was working several part time jobs—as many young people are doing today. And the IBEW was leading a union organizing drive of the women I worked with at the utility company. The local needed more women to help with the campaign, so I signed up to help with house calls and so did my mom. There was a lot of fear and the company was hostile. That experience made me realize that the power in numbers and workers coming together for a stronger voice is where I wanted to be. After hat campaign, I went to work full-time for IBEW Local 125 and I’ve never looked back. I mention this because I know from firsthand experience how the labor movement can lift up a family. And I also know that today millions of workers are being left behind—and that American Dream — that if you work hard, you can make a decent living and provide for your family—is slipping away and out of reach for too many people. But we have an opportunity…and a responsibility…to bring more workers into our movement, and build the political power we need to rewrite our economic rules so they work for all of us. And if labor needs a playbook on how to do exactly that, they should look no further than right here in Washington. Jeff mentioned a number of these victories and they're worth highlighting because you're setting the standard for other states to follow. I know about Initiative 1433 because last year, I had the privilege of speaking at an event in Washington, DC with Ariana Davis of UFCW Local 21, who at the time was the petitioner on Initiative 1433. We were doing a joint appearance on stage at a White House event called the United State of Women and we were both shaking in our boots because we were speaking before President Obama and Oprah Winfrey talking to several thousand people about why unions matter (no pressure). But Ariana’s message came through so powerfully…she talked about how shortly after turning 16, she started working at Safeway and everything changed. It was more than a job. She felt that being a part of the union gave her confidence…that she was respected by workers and managers alike. She became a force in her community — and she said it’s because she doesn’t stand alone…she's in a movement with grocery workers and steelworkers and teachers, and together, we have a voice and that's how we can make change.And that's just what you all did…Worked together to make change and pass Initiative 1433. Now your minimum wage is 11 dollars an hour and rising, and workers have access to 7 days of paid sick leave. And there is no doubt in my mind that these efforts paved the way for passage of the most generous paid family leave law in the country—giving eligible workers 12 weeks paid time off for a birth or serious medical condition. Now people in minimum wage jobs won’t have to choose between food and rent. Now mothers can spend time with their newborn without breaking their budget. Now workers who are sick can stay home and get well while still earning a day’s pay. These work/family issues are what matter to people’s daily lives, and the labor movement is winning them for everyone, not just our members. And this is a great example of what we call “issues driven politics,” where we focus on the issues, not just candidates or parties. And those economic issues are what drive people to get active and to vote. And if we elect pro-worker people in the positions of power who can change the economic rules, we can create opportunity for everyone. So let’s build on the amazing momentum you've created and bring it home in November by sending Manka Dhingra to the State Senate and give Governor Inslee a real pro-worker majority. (All eyes are on you, so bring it home in the 45th!). And how about electing union members to office like Teresa Mosqueda of OPEIU, Shaunie Wheeler and Matthew Hepner of IBEW and Larry Brown of the Machinists? Another great example of how we build independent political power—electing our own to office at all levels!Yes, you've made some serious progress in the Washington where YOU live, but things are not as great in the Washington where I live. Donald Trump is still the president. Congress still hates us. The Supreme Court has us in its sight lines, and our football team is an embarrassment (in more ways than one). But all is not lost…The theme of your convention is “Resist. Persist.” I want to assure you that we are doing both. We are resisting the Republican health care bill that would result in 22 million more people being uninsured, including nearly 300,000 in Washington. We are resisting President Trump’s budget which cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to give more tax cuts to the rich. With the help of leaders like Attorney General Bob Ferguson and Judge James Robart, we are resisting the Trump Administration’s unconstitutional and immoral travel ban. And we are resisting attacks on collective bargaining, workplace safety and public education. So while President Trump may have won the election, he hasn’t yet won a single major policy fight. Resistance is working. But it’s persistence that will get us where we need to be. The war on workers didn't just start with Donald Trump…this has been going on for decades. The ultra rich and their political allies have been rigging the economic rules to keep more money and power for themselves. CEOs have held wages down and prevented workers from forming unions. States have chipped away at worker rights under the guise of promoting freedom. And the gap between the rich and the rest of us has gotten larger and larger. So even if a Democrat was sitting in the Oval Office today, labor would still be facing an existential crisis. And it's peaking right now. It's a moment for us to step up our game and fight…but it's also time for deep evaluation and reflection on where we're going and how we build for the future. And if done right, we have the potential to not only survive the Trump Administration, but emerge from it stronger than before. We’ve been doing exactly that at the national level—some self evaluation. We've been restructuring the AFL-CIO to modernize how we meet the challenges of the changing workforce and rapidly evolving technology. We’ve been working closely with our affiliate unions, state federations, central labor councils and allies to build a federation and a labor movement that is proactive, strategic, nimble and fiscally responsible. Our mission is simple—it’s about unity. Unity across the labor movement is absolutely fundamental, and without it, we can't ensure that all working people have the freedom to join together and negotiate for a better life. We've rebuilt our structure — and eliminated the byzantine mix of old departments and now have focused our staff on three main bodies of work—mobilization, legislative/policy, and growth. We have three resource departments, Communications, legal and a new data and tech tools team that will make it all hum. We have a new team of really smart tech savvy developers and analysts to focus on creating new tools to enhance organizing. One that we’re really excited about that's in development now, is a tool to enable organizers in the field to gather data in the workplace and on the doors to run more effective campaigns—a ""mini VAN"" for organizing. The reason you should care about this is because tech companies know more about our members than we do. They are capturing all of the online behavior and using that information…if we don't take a huge leap forward on investments in data infrastructure we won't be able to connect with our members in a modern and effective way. And this isn't news to any of you…Washington is the land of Amazon. Last week, on Amazon Prime Day, the company had a 30-hour blowout sale to attract new dues-paying members and reward current ones. They used it as a high profile opportunity to demonstrate their value to customers. Tens of millions of people shopped and sales grew by more than 60 percent from the year before. Are there some parallels here? Should we be thinking about ways to demonstrate value to our members in new and different ways? Can you imagine if we could grow 60 percent over last year?!Unlike Amazon though, the labor movement offers much more than beauty products and golf clubs. Our number one seller is a great contract and a voice on the job. And we are the only watchdog out there that is sounding the alarms about how companies like Amazon and Uber are using 21st century technology as an excuse for 19th century labor practices. We won’t let them get away with it. The labor movement is all about innovation and disruption…but it must be used as a tool for broadly shared prosperity, not more corporate greed. And that’s why the model we've seen labor pushing in Seattle that gives gig economy or on-demand workers the right to unionize is something we should be expanding on—we need to be looking 10 years down the road. And while we’re talking about building for the future, we should also make unions the home of the people we used to call “minorities,” but who are now the emerging majority. We know the stats, that by 2055, whites will account for less than half of the U.S. population. We also know that a union contract is the best tool for achieving justice for ALL working people—but with 90 percent of America not in unions, and more young people unaware of what it means to be in a union, we have a big job to do to show the emerging majority that unions fight for them. For example, women are half the workforce, and will be half the union movement in 10 years. We need equal pay—let’s show that a union is the best way to achieve that. And while we’re at it, let’s move more women into the leadership of our unions to show that we are a movement for women. Young people need better jobs and less debt—we can be on the front lines of the college affordability debate and pushing for more resources for apprenticeship and training to show we’re relevant and a path forward for them. People of color want access to good jobs and a justice system that doesn't discriminate—let’s be their best advocate. Immigrants need a path to citizenship and protection from deportation..LGBTQ people need to stop being fired and bullied because of who they are. Let’s help the emerging majority connect the dots and show them that unions are the answer! Ultimately, changing our culture and preparing for the future is not going to be easy. I was with many of you at a summit in Los Angeles earlier this month about how best to fight back against growing anti-worker attacks. We know our enemies have made legislation like right to work their number one priority and we know why—the labor movement is the last institution left standing that can mobilize real people, votes and power. We know how to play defense—and we will—but we also know how to go on offense...we know how to work a plan...and win...the Washington labor movement has proven this time and time again. And now we have to work together like never before to keep our movement focused and strong. I truly believe this is a moment to bring our best ideas to the table—and not be afraid to take risks and do things differently. It's a moment to think creatively and LISTEN to each other and perhaps to others outside our movement with fresh perspectives. But most importantly, we HAVE to connect with our members in a way that makes ""right to work"" irrelevant. Think of the Amazon example. If members see us as a real asset to their lives, even national right to work won’t be able to stop us. They’ll want to pay. They’ll see dues as an investment rather than a cost. So now is the time to innovate...and try new things (maybe invent our equivalent to “Amazon Prime”.,) to build that enduring relationship with our members that transcends the next attack or the next election.And as I mentioned earlier, if we reassert our political independence, and put our agenda before party politics, we build power. And our members see that we are a movement of issues and values, not just politicians, which builds credibility and trust.So as you leave this convention, take a second to remember why you joined the labor movement in the first place. Think about the reasons why you are willing to sacrifice your time, your mental energy and often your own money to advance the cause of economic justice. Think about the people in your life and community who could and should benefit from a union. Our founders built something incredible. It is now our job to protect it, and take this movement forward and build it for the future. Thank you. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
278,Trumka at IATSE Convention: Labor Movement is Pushing Forward ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-iatse-convention-labor-movement-pushing-forward,7-18-2017,"Thank you, Brother Matt [Loeb], for your kind words of introduction and for inviting me to this important and timely gathering.I want to tell you how much I appreciate the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts. I mention the full name of your union, because you are all of those things, including practitioners of allied crafts. For nearly 125 years, your union members have fought for and won quality, family-supporting jobs. From theaters to vaudeville to movie and TV sets to stadium events, you’ve kept your focus on fair wages and good working conditions. You’ve expanded and evolved with the changing world of entertainment. You’re strong from coast to coast and in literally scores of cities and towns in between, from the Hudson Bay in Canada to the Gulf of Mexico and beyond. You truly are an international union, and during a period when private sector union membership has remained flat, you continue to grow. That’s a testament to your creative organizing, your political involvement and your member empowerment. These are the essential components of unionism. Brothers and sisters, we are the beating heart of the American labor movement, but our movement is much bigger than the individuals in this room or all the union members in America today. Everyone who works for a living shares our basic economic interests. Our unions are rising in popularity because we are showing working people the power of solidarity. It’s not enough for us to say it. People need to experience it. We need to show it, and show it again and again and again. And that’s what we’re doing. Just look at how voters have been raising wages from the bluest to the reddest states—through ballot measures, legislation and union organizing victories. Real people have been getting better pay. That’s progress. But it is only a start. We want more. We want broadly shared prosperity.The right-wing corporate CEOs and the wealthiest 1%—the vast networks who have made it their mission to destroy us—are bold. These folks never need to work a day in their lives. Their money works for them. They push policies with one goal, and that’s to make them richer and us poorer. To make them stronger and us weaker. That’s what we are up against. But let me be clear: I will take our solidarity over their money any day of the week.Just look at the current fight on health care. The Republican repeal bill is one of the worst pieces of legislation I have ever seen. It would take away health insurance from 22 million people, kill almost one and a half million jobs and destroy Medicaid—leaving seniors, children, the working poor and those suffering from addiction without a safety net—all to give another tax cut to corporations and the super-wealthy. So the labor movement is going all out to stop this legislation. We’re writing. We’re calling. We’re running ads. We’re making our voices heard. And guess what? As I stand here today, the Republican health care scam does not have the votes to pass. We did that! The health care fight is a reminder that our economy is not like the weather. It isn’t something that simply happens to us. We can change it with our activism on the job and by electing people to write new economic rules to benefit working families.Inequality is not inevitable. We have the power to change the rules of our economy and in the process, change the course of history. We have the power to grow unity in America.We need that unity now more than ever. The corporate right-wing and their hired politicians are doing everything they can do to destroy us. The anti-union attacks are coming hard and fast. Look at Washington. It’s even worse. So, we’re under attack. What else is new? We decide what our labor movement will be. Nobody tells us. We’re ready to take on the anti-union crowd. In fact, I want to tell you something. I want our opposition on the field of play feeling great. I want them on their best day. We don’t want them to have any excuses. We’ll meet them, fair and square. And then we’re going to beat the tar out their sorry butts! When it comes to the right-wing attacks on our unions, we’ve got to encourage our members and each other to let go of our fear. Fear doesn’t do us any favors. The same is true when local governments try to go non-union to cut down on our jobs. Hear me out. We will not fear these threats, but we will fight them. We will aim to defeat every attack on our jobs, on the institutions of our labor movement, on the core values we hold dear like freedom, equality and justice.We will use every fight to organize internally—to demonstrate our value to the hard-working men and women we represent. We’re educating our membership about the threats we face. Our sole mission is and will always be to build real power for working people each and every day so we can lift each other up. That’s our purpose.It won’t be easy, but our agenda unites us. Safe jobs. Good pay. Health care. A secure retirement. And a better life for our kids. That’s the American Dream, and it’s not too much to ask.Brothers and sisters, listen close. We will not settle for merely surviving as a labor movement. That’s not enough. We will thrive!Our labor movement is playing the long-game. There is no end to our fight. Twenty-eight states have passed right-to-work laws. Politicians are talking about introducing national right-to-work legislation. It’s a chilling proposal. They have one goal—to weaken the institutions of working people so they can pay us less, make us work in ever more dangerous conditions, keep us apart and hold us down. But let me make a point about right to work that we should never forget. Right to work does not take collective bargaining rights away from a single worker. And it does not force a single union member to stop paying dues unless they want to. In other words, right to work cannot and should not stop us from doing our job—organizing new members, engaging with current ones and providing the best representation in the world. That’s how we’ll make right to work irrelevant. In 2016, despite powerful opposition and a daunting political environment, working people raised pay by 3%—the highest in years. We’re still pushing up. We’re finding ways to grow power. We’re finding ways to unite for what we want and need.This political and economic environment is a powerful laboratory, forcing us to adapt. It’s making us stronger. I can feel it. We are in the heat of the fire, and like tempered steel we will come out stronger!Just remember: We’re the ones who plant the crops and push the mops. We build the stage and paint the scenes. We form the wheels and make the tires. We load the trucks and drive them, too. We face each challenge. We never run and hide. We wake America up every single morning, and we put her to bed at night. We stand strong. We stand together. We stand united! This is our country. We built her. We make her run. We defend her. And it is high time we took her back for workers. At this convention, you’ve heard about the economic outlook for your industries and your futures. You’re heard from powerful union leaders and veteran campaigners. I know over the years how your members have taken part in AFL-CIO campaigns. I want to thank you for the work you’ve done, and ask you to do more. Our folks know how to win. There has never been a more important time in America for workers to assert our collective power. Every day, we’re more independent. We aren’t carrying water for either political party, not Democrats or Republicans. Our issues are leading our politics, not the other way around. The way forward won’t be easy, but the future is ours to shape. And it all starts with solidarity.Solidarity is most important when times are tough and disagreements are sharp—when the sun isn’t shining, when good people want to duck their heads and hide.How all of us respond to the challenges and opportunities of today and in the days to come will define who and what we are as a labor movement and a nation.Don’t ever lose sight of the big picture: The momentum is swinging our way. America is in the midst of a long overdue national conversation about income inequality.A powerful majority of Americans support unions, especially among young people.We know the way forward. Collective action is part of the national conversation now, and that’s a good thing. I say it’s about time. We’re not complacent. We’re not timid. We’re not crouching in a corner trembling. We’re ready for a fight. Our opponents are bold. They’re well-funded and ruthless. I say, bring it on! We're still standing. Standing proud. Standing united. Standing strong. Together forever. Many times we have fallen. We have been battered and bruised. We have been beaten and bloodied—maimed and killed. But always—always we’ve helped each other up. We’ve locked arms. We’ve pushed forward with steel in our eyes. And we’ve broken their lines. This is our day. This is our time to push forward. Thank you. God bless you, God bless your families and all the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
279,Trumka Lays Out Roadmap for Labor's Future,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-lays-out-roadmap-labors-future,6-29-2017,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the following remarks to 750 labor leaders, activists and staff from California, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Alaska. Thank you, Brother Tom [Chamberlain], for your kind words of introduction and for inviting me to this important and timely gathering.The subject of this conference gets at the heart of where our labor movement is, and where we need to be. It forces us to confront our real priorities. It requires us to lean into our faith in the power of solidarity and our deep sense of mission.Brothers and sisters, we are the beating heart of the American labor movement, but our movement is much bigger than the individuals in this room or all the union members in America today. Everyone who works for a living shares our basic economic interests. Our movement is growing, and our unions are rising in popularity, because we are showing America how solidarity works, how raising wages works. It’s not enough for us to say it. People need to experience it. We need to show it, and show it again and again and again. And that’s what we’re doing. Just look at how voters have been raising wages from the bluest to the reddest states—through ballot measures, legislation and union organizing victories. Real people have been getting better pay. That’s progress. But it is only a start. We want more. We want broadly shared prosperity.The right-wing corporate CEOs and the wealthiest 1%—the vast networks who have made it their mission to destroy us—are feeling emboldened. These folks never need to work a day in their lives, because their money works for them. The policies they push have one goal, and that’s to make them richer and us poorer. To make them stronger and us weaker. That’s what we are up against. But let me be clear: I will take our solidarity over their money any day of the week.Last year, President Lee Saunders of AFSCME spoke at the AFL-CIO headquarters as our officers and staff prepared to participate in AFSCME Strong, the internal organizing program that talks directly to union members about the value of standing together. As he addressed the packed room that day, he said something very powerful. He said he welcomed the challenge to his union posed by the lawsuit then in front of the Supreme Court at the time—Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association.He welcomed the challenge, because—while AFSCME is strong—it must be stronger. That means connecting, talking, listening, organizing and mobilizing. He knew that either we grow or we die. And he understands that engaged and involved union members know union dues are a vital investment, not an added expense.The same is true about the AFL-CIO and every union in America.When I talk about the economy, I make the point that it’s not like the weather. It isn’t like rain on a picnic. It isn’t something that simply happens to us. We can change it with our activism on the job and by electing people to write new economic rules to benefit working families.Inequality is not inevitable. Flat wages are not a natural phenomenon. We have the power to change the rules of our economy and in the process, change the course of history.We have the power to grow unity in America.We’re under attack! So what else is new?

He’s a pro. You’ve heard from President Ted Pappageorge of Culinary Local 226 about strategies to build union power in tough circumstances. You’ve no doubt shared your experiences and ideas and picked up some new ones.There has never been a more important time in America for workers to assert our collective power.

280,Trumka Addresses Senate Health Care Bill Developments,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-addresses-senate-health-care-bill-developments,6-28-2017,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks on a press call regarding the Senate health care bill:

Thank you for joining me on this call. Today, working people are relieved that legislation designed to destroy our health care does not have the votes to pass. But we will not for a single second rest on our laurels. This fight is just beginning. We have no illusions. Senator Mitch McConnell has a PHD in Washington backroom deals. He will exhaust every trick in the book, every slight-of-hand and every shady deal to get this bill signed into law. We will not relent until it is dead and gone.Make no mistake, this bill isn’t a health care plan at all. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from workers to Wall Street. It obliterates Medicaid. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, it would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 22 million. And it cuts taxes for millionaires while raising taxes on hard-working men and women who have negotiated high-quality health care. This bill is a sham—and it’s a shame. So working families are fighting back. We are fighting for our children, our parents and our communities. No amount of tweaks or window dressing can change the fact that this is a vicious assault on America’s health care security. It is time for Congress to abandon this reckless plan and come together on a bipartisan basis to improve the Affordable Care Act. That’s what voters want. Working people brought this bill to a screeching halt. We mobilized in record time, and we won’t stand down. We’re running ads. We’re flooding Senate offices with phone calls. We’re going all out. If the Senate insists on moving forward with this plan, we will continue to make our voices heard. I appreciate the moderate Republicans who have announced their opposition to the bill as written. I urge Senator Collins, Senator Capito, Senator Portman and Senator Heller to stand strong. And I urge Senator Murkowski to join them. Any bill that causes coverage losses, reduces the quality of care or increases out-of-pocket costs is unacceptable and we’ll continue to hold senators accountable to that standard. As I have always said, if the House and Senate are willing to get serious about finding ways to make health care more affordable and accessible, we want to be part of the solution. We have ideas about how to get it done. We want to be part of the conversation. But any discussion about moving forward starts with abandoning this misguided bill. I would now like to introduce you to a few special guests who will speak from personal experience about the importance of protecting America’s health care. © 2023 AFL-CIO.

281,Trumka Talks Labor Unity in San Diego,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-talks-labor-unity-san-diego,6-24-2017,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council Awards Dinner:Brothers and sisters, it’s great to be with you. Thank you, Doug, my brother, for your warm words of welcome. I appreciate you. I appreciate each and every one of you, both what you’ve done and what you will do. You are demonstrating tremendous solidarity right now. We are together. We truly are one. Before I get into my remarks, I want to take a moment to acknowledge this historic organization—chartered 115 years ago by Samuel Gompers in 1902. History is in front of us, as well as behind us. You’re making history with passion and hard work. You have brought us to where we are. Thank you.It’s not easy to rebuild a labor council. Let me be very clear. It takes a lot of emotional honesty to step forward and speak up. You’ve done that. You’ve made this labor council your own. And once you’ve done that, rebuilding takes follow through. You’ve got to show up and make good on the commitments you’ve made. You’ve done that. You’re doing it now, and I commend you for it. The future is bright. You’ve just held your most successful fundraiser ever. Over $400,000 raised. You’ve got two new affiliations, Local 30 of UNITE HERE and Local 230 of the UA. Congratulations! That’s great news. You’ve achieved local legislative victories and a county-level electoral win! That’s fantastic. You’ve shown you know how to win. It’s a great start. You know, I think this might be the last term in Congress for Darrell Issa! What do you think? Issa’s days of undercutting letter carriers and postal workers—of gunning for workers’ retirement—of trying to take health care away from millions of Americans—they are numbered. Brothers and sisters, you will write new rules here in Southern California. You will unite workers and lift up our families. And this labor council is going to lead the way. Solidarity works! It’s the strongest force in the world. We can’t be beat, when you stand with me, and I stand with you, when your picket line is my picket line, and my picket line is your picket line! Our agenda unites us. Safe jobs. Good pay. Health care. A secure retirement. And a better life for our kids. That’s the American Dream, and it’s not too much to ask.Brothers and sisters, some of our union members patrol the US-Mexico border just a few miles south of here, and some of our members cross the border from homes in Tijuana every day to come to work. That’s a fact. Our union members are Democrats, Republicans and everything in between. We are members of every race and religion. We speak every language. We’re every gender, sexual orientation and gender identity. We were born right here in California, and all around the world. Think about that. In this day of polar opposition, when politics break up friendships, spur division and even go so far as to inspire murderous passion at home and abroad, it’s important for us to recognize—even celebrate—that our diversity is our strength. We are one! I believe America today needs what the labor movement has to offer. Our country is hungry for a new set of economic rules. That’s why voters have been raising the minimum wage from the bluest to the reddest states. We want better pay. We want progress. We want shared prosperity. The work you’re doing here in San Diego is critical, because you are showing us all that building bridges is more powerful than building walls. You’re showing us how working families can and will win. Now more than ever, I believe our path to victory is through political independence. We need to be a labor movement of ideas and issues and values, not partisanship. If Republicans want to help us, great. If Democrats can’t deliver, we’ll find someone who can. Our only fidelity is to working people. We will support those who support us—no matter their political party. This is the approach I’ve taken with Donald Trump. I judge his actions with a simple yardstick. Does it help working families? Or does it hurt? On every single issue, I’ve given President Trump our ideas and suggestions. I’ve asked him to follow through on his campaign pledges by laying out a vision that reflects America’s priorities, one that raises wages, keeps workers safe, protects retirement security, strengthens unions and provides opportunity for all.And yet almost everything he has done has hurt. I have a message for President Trump: not on our watch. We are mobilizing against his tax cuts and health care cuts and cuts to worker safety and cuts to environmental protections and economic development and everything else that hurts working people! You know, before he took office, President Trump used his bully pulpit to tell companies to keep jobs in America. Look, every president should fight to keep good jobs here, because every single job saved means one more family can pay down the mortgage, save for college or retire with dignity. But simply telling companies what to do isn’t good enough, especially if the jobs saved provide low wages and little voice. I have asked President Trump to use his office and influence to call for an end to workplace intimidation, to reject “right to work” once and for all and to promote and protect the freedom of every single worker to form or join a union and bargain for a better life.Give us a level playing field and a fair set of economic rules and we’ll build the best economy this country has ever seen. We have what it takes. Quite frankly, our local labor federations and central labor councils are the place where our movement reaches workers on the ground. You are where the power is. For that reason, you are the best vehicle for worker activism. You are the AFL-CIO’s greatest source of strength. This is where union members from all walks of life phone bank together, do labor walks together and join each other on the picket line. I’m proud of the progress you’ve made, and I want you to know that the entire AFL-CIO supports you. We have your back as you pursue your common agenda, led by a shared vision for the greater good. Just remember: We’re the ones who plant the crops and push the mops. We dig the coal and build the roads. We roll the steel and make the tires. We load the trucks and drive them, too. We face each challenge. We’ll never run and hide. We wake America up every single morning, and we put her to bed at night. We stand strong. We stand together. We’re the American labor movement, and we will not be denied! There has never been a more important time in America for workers to assert our collective power. Yet as I speak about the gains we can win and the power we can build, I’m not asking any of us to disregard reality. It won’t be easy. We face long odds. But nothing is set in stone. The future is ours to shape.And it all starts with solidarity. Solidarity is most important when times are tough and disagreements are strong—when the sun isn’t shining. Brothers and sisters, what you did here in San Diego, rebuilding this council, is the definition of solidarity. And I am very proud of you. Now the really hard work begins. How all of us respond to the challenges and opportunities of today and in the days to come will define who and what we are as a labor movement and a nation.Don’t ever lose sight of the big picture: The momentum is swinging our way. Collective action is on the rise. America is in the midst of an overdue national conversation about income inequality. A powerful majority of Americans support unions, and our popularity is growing, especially among young people.We know the way forward. Collective action is part of the national conversation now, and that’s a good thing. Don’t get me wrong. Our opponents are bold. They’re well-funded and ruthless. They’re going keep up the fight. I say, bring it on! We've taken your best shot and we're still standing today. Strong. United. Together. Forever. Thank you. God bless you, God bless your families and members and all the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
282,Trumka Calls for Action and Leadership on NAFTA,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-calls-action-and-leadership-nafta,6-12-2017,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks during a press call on the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA):Good morning. I want to thank my friend and brother United Steelworkers President Leo Gerard for his incredible leadership on trade. And I want to thank all of you for joining us. Later today, the AFL-CIO will be submitting our formal recommendations on how best to renegotiate NAFTA. Each of you have received a copy of our proposals. They are bold. They are detailed. And they are necessary. So instead of reiterating the policy, I’d like to spend a few minutes on the politics. For decades now, America’s trade deals have been a bipartisan disaster. Corporate-written trade has killed jobs, held down wages and devastated communities.And no agreement has done more damage than NAFTA. As a candidate, Donald Trump talked a good game on trade. As president, he has been all over the map. One week it’s the worst trade agreement in history. The next week it just needs minor tweaks. The American people are tired of it. I’m tired of it. Talk is cheap. It is time for this administration to rewrite NAFTA the right way. That takes real leadership. It’s one thing to walk away from a deal—like President Trump did with Paris or withdraw from an agreement that’s already dead—like he did with TPP.It’s entirely another to improve a deal that has existed for over two decades and has the support of the Washington and Wall Street establishment. That is the challenge facing this president. And the people who voted for Donald Trump in Wisconsin and Michigan and my home state of Pennsylvania are counting on him to do the right thing. If President Trump follows our recommendations—if he renegotiates NAFTA so it’s a real force for higher wages and broadly shared prosperity—we will help him pass it.If President Trump uses renegotiation to further rig the rules for the wealthiest few, we will fight him with everything we have. And if President Trump breaks his promise and leaves the worst pieces of NAFTA in place, we will never forget it. Thank you very much.

283,Shuler Celebrates LGBTQ Pride ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-celebrates-lgbtq-pride,6-9-2017,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler delivered the following remarks at Pride at Work's annual Celebrating Solidarity reception: Thank you, Jerame (Davis), for that kind introduction. Welcome to the AFL-CIO, everybody. Happy Pride! Just about a year ago, I stood in the lobby of this building at an impromptu vigil for the 49 people killed at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando. One by one, the amazing women and men who work here came to the front and read the names and ages of the victims. In that profoundly sad moment, I felt pride. Pride in the labor movement. Pride in the AFL-CIO. Pride in you. Today, as we celebrate solidarity and honor our out-union leaders, my heart is filled with pride. I am proud of the labor movement for making justice and fairness our mission. I am proud to serve with leaders like Rich Trumka and Tefere Gebre who are committed to achieving equality for all workers. I am proud of Pride at Work for making sure the labor movement focuses on LGBTQ issues AND the LGBTQ movement focuses on labor issues. I am proud of our incredible honorees tonight. They are out. They are proud. And they make our movement stronger. Donna Cartwright—a trailblazer for trans equality, longtime CWA member and tireless union activist.Mary Kay Henry—the brave and dynamic leader of the Service Employees International Union and one of the architects of the Fight for $15.Stuart Appelbaum—the brilliant, fierce and determined leader of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union who, if you didn’t know, successfully organized Babeland, a New York City sex shop.Randi Weingarten—the fearless and committed leader of the American Federation of Teachers, who spends every waking moment improving the lives of our nation’s teachers, students and families. Please join me in a round of applause for tonight’s honorees. We are here tonight to celebrate. But there is still much work to be done. LGBTQ people continue to face discrimination at alarming rates. Violence against trans people of color is a national epidemic. You can still be fired because of who you are in over half of all states. Extremists from the state house to the White House are attacking our dignity and our rights. So tonight, I want to invite every member of the LGBTQ community to join the labor movement. Let our contracts protect you and lift you up. When you form or join a union, you don’t just get higher wages, better benefits and protection from discrimination, you get 12.5 million sisters, brothers and friends who will always have your back. Every single day. Together, we are going to fight back against the haters—in politics, in religion, in business, in sports. We will confront bigotry wherever it rears its ugly head. We refuse to go back in the closet. We refuse to go back in the shadows. To quote the great prophet Katy Perry: We’re gonna stick around for more than a minute. Get used to it. Our movement is here to stay. We are here to fight. And we are here to win. Thank you very much! Happy Pride! © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
284,Trumka: Rebuild Collective Power of Working People Around the Globe,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-rebuild-collective-power-working-people-around-globe,6-7-2017,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today delivered the following remarks at an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) panel on the global economic outlook: Good morning everyone, and thank you to Angel, to Prime Minister Rasmussen and to the Panel. Let me begin by complimenting Catherine Mann and the team here at the OECD. The Economic Outlook for 2017 and the Stocktaking Paper for the Ministerial on Globalization really do grapple with the core economic problem OECD countries face—the vicious cycle of stagnant wages and low growth. The Stocktaking Paper tells us globalization has meant rising inequality. The cause of rising inequality turns out to be the decline in workers’ share of income and wages not keeping up with productivity. That turns out to be because of the decline in workers’ bargaining power as a result of globalization being managed in ways that pit workers’ against each other. Underneath all of this is the decline of the percentage of workers belonging to unions and covered by collective bargaining. Now I want to be clear, this is not my explanation—this is what the OECD says in the Outlook and the Note.    The challenge from here is that we must on the one hand get to the root causes of this low growth trap in policy choices. We must stop trying to marginalize the crisis of low wages and stagnant growth as merely regional, or treat it as if it were somehow inevitable rather than being the product of policy choices.  Then we must actually bring the OECD’s policy prescriptions into line with our economic analysis. Because I am afraid Angel that though today is Wednesday we are still dealing with a Monday OECD and a Tuesday OECD that just refuses to go away—the Economic Outlook is now clearly the Monday OECD—really digging in to the problem of wage stagnation—and for that we are all thankful. But when we look at country specific policy prescriptions in Going for Growth it's still very much Tuesday—meaning we still see the recommendations to weaken collective bargaining, lower the minimum wage and weaken unemployment insurance—exactly the policies that have produced the serious economic and political crisis we now face. This schizophrenia really must stop if we are to solve this crisis. Because as we sit here today we face a crisis not just of the project of globalization but of democracy itself—in a way we haven’t seen since the 1930’s.  Anti-democratic forces are able to gain ground fundamentally because ordinary people believe democracy has come to mean inequality, poverty, and rising economic insecurity. In the United States, a recent Harvard University public opinion study found only 30% of people born since 1980 think democracy is necessary for a good society, and 24% think democracy is harmful.This is precisely why we must not allow the policy debate to become one between neoliberals and authoritarians. We must have a humane economic vision AND a human political vision. That requires rebuilding the collective power of working people, both in the workplace and in politics. Because in a world of global corporations and big data, of Nissan and Uber—collective power is the only form of empowerment that actually exists for ordinary people. The first steps though are that we must stop making excuses and stop making policy recommendations that amount to ripping out the economic foundations of democracy.We must stop trying to make excuses by referring to megaforces such as technology or globalization and get serious about the fact that policymakers are responsible for the way megaforces are harnessed—either to enrich a handful of people or for the broader good. We must stop marginalizing the problem—while regional issues are important, wage stagnation is a global issue and at the very core of our crisis. It also does not help to talk about “compensating the losers” when the majority of the working population in OECD countries are the quote “losers.”We must stop the double standard where we refer to the employer community and the investor community, but then talk about solutions for workers as if we can make it on our own as isolated individuals.  We must stop with the narrative that somehow in dramatically wealthier world we cannot afford the economic dignity and security for ordinary people that policymakers took for granted when the OECD was founded.  We must move on from policies that attack the working people of the OECD that go by code words like “structural reform” and “flexibility” and instead get serious about protecting democracy by building social solidarity. The OECD should be in the business of helping people build democratic institutions that give them economic and political voice—guardians of equality and democracyAnd please, please understand, the alternative to addressing wage stagnation and the status of working people in the global economy is not more of the same elite dominated globalization. The alternative is an escalating crisis where the false promises of authoritarianism and racism threaten to overwhelm the democratic ideal.Thank you very much.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

285,Trumka Honors John Sweeney at Book Event,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-honors-john-sweeney-book-event,5-30-2017,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at an event celebrating the memoir of AFL-CIO President Emeritus John Sweeney: Brothers and sisters, I’m so glad to be here with you all on this wonderful day to celebrate this important book and to look back on how we arrived at this moment in time. I’d like to share with you the story of how I met the man we’re here to celebrate today, my friend and brother, John Sweeney. This was 1982, not long after I became president of the United Mine Workers of America. Another union had a reception for me. I didn’t know many folks there. I knew some, but there were a lot of new faces. A man walked up to me, shook my hand and started to ask me questions. I’m sure you’ve had this happen in your life. He had hardly said five words before I knew I liked him. He was so genuine, so humble and so interested. Honestly, he congratulated me so sincerely and with such joy that you’d have thought he had won, too. The truth is, we both won that day, because it was the beginning of a long, deep and rewarding friendship. The man was John Sweeney. At that time, he was the president of the Service Employees International Union. Most of you already know the rest of the story, or at least the broad strokes of it. John Sweeney became president of the AFL-CIO in 1995, with me as the Secretary-Treasurer. In 2009, I became president. John Sweeney stood by my side every step of the way. If you know those broad strokes, and you want to understand the heart of the man behind them, I urge you to dig into John’s memoir. It reveals a side of John that most people have not seen. He talks about his childhood, his parents and his union. He talks about his faith and how it guided him. In fact, he got into unionism because he believed it to be one of the best ways to live out his values. His career in the labor movement was a spiritual calling. Here’s something important for you to know. From the time we first met about 35 years ago, John set a powerful example for me personally and for the entire labor movement. He built SEIU from a sleepy little union into a powerhouse. His style has never been flashy, but he always got results. He built deep and lasting relationships. He earned a lot of respect. I am honored to have served alongside John Sweeney. I’m proud to call him my brother. He’s truly a wonderful man, one of the only people who faithfully lives that old adage, “it’s better to give than to receive.” Please give a warm hand to John Sweeney, and everybody… read his book! God bless you. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
286,Shuler Stands with Yale Graduate Student-Workers,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-stands-yale-graduate-student-workers,5-22-2017,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler today delivered the following remarks at a rally in support of Yale graduate student-workers who are fighting for a first contract:

I’m Liz Shuler, and I’m proud to be here on behalf of the 12.5 million working women and men of the AFL-CIO. We stand with you. Teachers stand with you. Electrical workers stand with you. Autoworkers stand with you. Dishwashers and bartenders stand with you. The labor movement stands with you! It’s commencement day and we are here with a message for Yale administrators: Commence bargaining! Stop delaying. Stop scheming. Stop lying. Teaching assistants won the election. Fair and square. Now it is time to negotiate a first contract. Anything less violates the laws of our land. But it does more than that. Let me read you a bit of Yale’s mission statement. Yale is committed to improving the world today and for future generations...We carry out this mission through the free exchange of ideas in an ethical, interdependent, and diverse community of faculty, staff, students, and alumni.So my question is this: how are you improving the world by denying student-workers a voice on the job?How are you fostering a free exchange of ideas by refusing to bargain?Do you really want Yale to be the Walmart of the Ivy League?This is a test of character. The strikers have demonstrated their commitment to Yale’s mission—sacrificing physical comfort for the greater good. I am proud of these heroes and she-roes. You have taken your place among the great activists in American history. And we have your back. Today, tomorrow and every day. What you are doing will have an impact well beyond New Haven. In universities big and small, teaching and research assistants, adjunct professors and post-docs are looking to you to carry this moment. These young women and men aren’t asking for the world. Just a voice and a say. On pay. On working conditions. On protection from sexual harassment and discrimination. Yale teaching assistants meet the common law definition of employees. They also meet the common sense definition. They work. For pay. And they voted democratically to form a union. It is time for Yale to acknowledge what is right in front of them.Brave, proud union members who decided to make this campus their home. When these student-workers look at that Yale degree on the office wall of whatever amazing job they do next, will they remember a university that did right by them? Or will they remember just another employer that made their lives harder for power and greed? Yale, you can fix this today. If you need someone to beat, stick to Harvard. It is time to do right by your own. Come to the bargaining table at once.Thank you very much. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
287,Shuler Discusses Importance of United Global Labor Movement,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-discusses-importance-united-global-labor-movement,5-10-2017,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler today delivered the following remarks at the FNV 2017 Congress:

Thank you, Brother Han, and all of the great leaders of the FNV for inviting me here today. We are inspired by your success in reorganizing and creating a more dynamic federation and movement to lift up workers. I also want to thank Rudy De Leeuw for his partnership and his friendship. Never before has it been so important to have a strong, effective global labor movement to address the challenges workers are facing around the world. As I start, I want to recognize the incredible work and struggle of KCTU. We must remember and stand in solidarity with Han Sang-gyun, president of KCTU, who is currently serving a three-year prison sentence for exercising his fundamental labor rights and fighting against an anti-worker, corrupt regime—and the many other activists who still face similar repression. The fight for justice, accountability and union rights in South Korea and the KCTU’s relentless work with ITUC to hold major companies like Samsung accountable is something we can all learn from and build on.We are living through a profoundly challenging moment. The rise of right-wing populism here in the Netherlands, in France, in the United States and around the world presents a clear threat to our mission and our values. Despite pro-worker rhetoric, we know that these politicians have put forward policies that will continue to favor corporations and leave workers with less power and less money.In the United States, we have an administration that has made inconsistent foreign policy statements that directly challenge multilateralism. This is a dangerous position because workers need a rules based global system that creates decent work, jobs and social protections that allow them to live a life of dignity with their families. Now is the time to develop even stronger transatlantic and global partnerships where we can lock arms in unmatched solidarity to beat back these attacks and build momentum for an inclusive economic, social and political agenda that is pro-worker, pro-family and pro-democracy. To state it more plainly, we need to be a movement for justice.We can do it. But it will take everything we have everywhere we are. Global corporations have organized their production in ways that make it hard for workers to effectively bargain and build power. They are supporting politicians that promote anti-worker agendas. They want to keep us isolated, quiet and poor. They are using race, gender and ethnicity to pit workers against each other. My message to the corporate elite and the right-wing populists is this: we will not be divided. Despite enormous challenges, collective action is on the rise. We see it in the United States where a coalition of working people, women, immigrants and allies have mobilized to hold President Trump accountable. Never before have we seen this kind of activism. The Women’s March. The March for Science. The Climate March. May Day. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are taking to the streets on a regular basis and demanding civil rights and LGBTQ rights and immigrant rights and worker rights. Here in the Netherlands, voters stood together and rejected the politics of fear. Similarly, in France, the vast majority of voters held the line against the far-right extremism of the National Front and Marine Le Pen.

And in countries big and small, ordinary people are speaking out for a fair deal and a more democratic future. Every single person who yearns for a better life has a home in our labor movement. We are the place where wages are high, work is safe and retirement is secure. We build power together so no one gets left behind. Now it is up to us to market and grow and strengthen our movement so it can deliver for those who need it most. That means we need to build transformational partnerships with allied organizations to expand our movements.

Our goal is clear—we must rewrite the rules of the global economy to lift wages, and effectively give workers the power to bargain collectively with their employers. We need fair trade deals that raise standards and hold corporations accountable. We need a just global migration system where workers are encouraged to follow their dreams with equal rights and protections. And we need a strict zero-tolerance policy when it comes to racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia and transphobia. We simply cannot build broadly shared prosperity on a foundation of hate. So where do we go from here? We need to develop joint strategies that will make the economy work for ALL workers from Bangladesh to Mexico to the U.S. to the Netherlands. We have started by working together to develop joint principles with the European Trade Union Confederation to inform our position on trade agreements like TTIP. We will actively and relentlessly oppose any global deal that leaves corporations stronger and workers weaker. That’s not trade. It’s trickle down. Working together, we can develop proactive proposals that lead to new, pro-worker models of trade.On the organizing front, we grapple with two-faced global management strategies. Multinational corporations routinely engage in social dialogue and exercise neutrality in Europe while operating regressive management practices in the United States. We are extremely grateful for your solidarity in demanding that companies practice what they preach everywhere they operate. Cross-border pressure with our colleagues in the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and others has added new tools and strategies to our organizing campaigns with companies like Nissan, Ikea and T-Mobile despite historic employer resistance. We stand ready to do the same for you.

Our work together on the Committee for Workers Capital (CWC) also gives us a powerful tool for leveraging our investments. By ensuring that our retirement assets are invested in ways that help and don’t harm our members, we can fill a unique role in the global economy. For instance, the Taskforce on Sustainability Ratings is working to incorporate workers’ rights into investment decisions. I am proud to serve on the committee’s leadership team with the FNV. Together, we have the power to better serve and respect our members and shape the economy of the future.Finally, I could not travel nearly 5,000 miles without saying a word or two about Donald Trump. Our offices may be next to each other, but our philosophies are worlds apart. Here is what you have to understand about Trump. His business is theatre. He was able to win over many working people by tapping into their frustrations and fears. He railed against unfair trade deals. He strongly criticized corporate power. He talked over and over again about rebuilding American manufacturing and creating American jobs. Union members responded to these messages. But rhetoric gets working people nothing. We need tangible results, not more broken promises. So we are holding Trump accountable for every single pledge. We are demanding action on the issues that matter most. And we are making it clear that our agenda comes before our politics. That is how we will build credibility with our members and position ourselves to elect leaders who are truly our champions. Over the next two days, you will be contributing to building a movement for change, tackling political strategy, organizing and the future of work. These issues are central in building a global economy that delivers decent jobs and social justice. And that’s what we are fighting for. I look forward to an excellent Congress. Thank you. © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
288,Trumka Touts Compromise to Penn State Fayette Graduates,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-touts-compromise-penn-state-fayette-graduates,5-6-2017,"Good morning, Class of 2017! It is wonderful to be here with you today. And it is an honor to be back where I first got started. Dr. Patrick, thank you so much for inviting me to address this year’s graduates. I also want to recognize the Advisory Board, faculty, staff and alumni who made this day possible and continue to make Penn State Fayette so special. Graduates, how are you feeling today? Did you have a late night? Don’t worry, I promise to be short and will do my best to supply you all with strong content for your Snapchat stories. But for those of you snapping, please know that dog ears are not my best look. It’s graduation day. The end of one great journey and the start of another. Today, you finish your time here at Fayette. Tomorrow, you take your place in the real world. And in 175 days, Penn State kicks the crap out of Ohio State at the Horseshoe in Columbus. It feels great to be home in Southwest Pennsylvania. I grew up about 30 minutes from here in Nemacolin. Like Dr. Patrick, I was the first in my family to get a college degree. And Fayette made it possible. I attended classes here while working the midnight shift in the mines. I’d finish work about 8 a.m. and be on campus shortly thereafter. I drank a lot of coffee. Maybe you can relate. But even in my most exhausted moments, I was learning and growing. Fayette helped give me a foundation for life. I learned about what it means to be a citizen. I learned the importance of community. I learned how to listen and engage and understand. I suspect and hope you’ve learned those things, too. Because I can tell you from firsthand experience that these tools will serve you throughout your life. To this day, I take Fayette with me everywhere I go. I want to say a word of thanks to the parents today. For your patience. For your understanding. For your checkbooks. My parents sacrificed for me just as you have sacrificed for these graduates. This is your victory, too—and don’t you ever forget it! Please join me in a show of appreciation for the parents. Last year, I welcomed my grandson into the world, Richard Trumka III, or as we call him, Trey. Trey is a beautiful soul, and each time I hold him in my lap I am reminded of what is truly important. Happiness is not found in a fancy car or a big house. It is the byproduct of a full life. Class of 2017, that’s what I want for you. I will not sugarcoat it. You are set to enter a world that is complicated, divided and sometimes dangerous. There has been a breakdown in civility and discourse. All you have to do is check your Facebook feed to see that. America’s institutions are under attack and our economy simply is not working for the vast majority of us. Your generation will have to face these challenges head on. Here is the good news: I know you can do it. I know it because of students like Kelsey Bailey. Kelsey grew up in Uniontown and came to Fayette because she didn’t want to be a number in a crowd. She blossomed here, making lifelong friends, bonding with faculty members and finding her true calling. Kelsey started with an undecided major but eventually developed a passion for social work. Penn State helped train her to be an advocate for victims of sexual assault. Her study on relationships was featured by the Midwestern Psychological Association at a recent conference in Chicago. Inspired by professors like Dr. Elaine Barry and Dr. Nicole Iannone, Kelsey will soon start a graduate program at California University of Pennsylvania with plans to become a clinical psychologist. Kelsey is going to change the world. I highlighted Kelsey’s experience, but I could have been talking about any one of you. This is your story. This is our story. This is the story of a small, scrappy campus in the mountains of Pennsylvania. This place changes lives. This is a place to be proud of. If someone ever tells you there’s nothing between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, invite them here. We’ll show them how wrong they are.

Never forget where you came from. Hold on to your experiences. The friends, the teachers, the classes. The parties, the sports, the relationships, hanging out in the Williams Building. These are a part of you. I have been blessed with great opportunities in my life. I’ve sat with presidents and prime ministers. I’ve traveled around the world. I’ve gotten to apply my trade at the highest levels imaginable. But I’ve never stopped being a kid from Nemacolin. I’ve never stopped seeing myself as the son of a coal miner. I remember what it’s like to struggle and go without. I remember when a trip to Pittsburgh seemed like a really big deal. I wear my working-class identity as a badge of honor. These days, I feel like America could take a cue from our small towns and community campuses. We discuss. We listen. We compromise. We work things out. We see the humanity in each other. Do we have our share of disagreements? Of course. But we don’t set out to tear each other down. Penn State taught me to be open to other points of view. It taught me the value of ideas. It taught me that listening is more than pausing until it’s your turn to talk. It actually requires hearing what the other person is saying. These core values are being threatened today. We see it in politicians who won’t work together for the betterment of the people they are sworn to serve. We see it in our media bubble, where ideas are reinforced rather than challenged. We see it online, where keyboard warriors bully and mock and rant for sport—yet when the time for thoughtful debate occurs, they are nowhere to be found. We must do better. And you can help lead the way. Our region has always gone above and beyond for the country we love. Pennsylvania played a crucial role in the Civil War, supplying 360,000 soldiers for the Union side. The battle at Gettysburg—not far from where we gather today—changed the course of history. And our citizens continue to answer the call of duty. So to every service member and veteran here today, we say thank you. As patriotic Americans, it is natural to be concerned about the future of our country. Listen to this—a recent study from Harvard showed that only 30 percent of young people believe it’s essential to live in a democratic nation. 30 percent! This is a startling statistic. I believe it reflects the simple truth that young people are bearing the brunt of our broken politics. The American idea that anything is possible if you work hard and play by the rules has become less and less secure for your generation and too many others. In my mind, this breakdown in opportunity is directly tied to a breakdown in civility. When our elected leaders can’t get together on simple things like fair interest rates for student loans, young people not only lose out on a quality, affordable education, they become more disillusioned with the whole system. Imagine what we could achieve together if we committed to solving problems instead of settling scores. Compromise can show us the way forward. Let me explain. Fayette taught me that there is value in getting to know someone, in understanding what it’s like to walk in their shoes, in being willing to give something up in order to build a stronger relationship. I am not advocating that you compromise your principles or lose a piece of who you are. Clearly, there is good compromise and there is bad compromise. But you will never achieve a breakthrough from the distant corners of isolation and self-righteousness. What I learned here at this school is the power of dialogue. Over the past few months, I’ve met with President Trump on several occasions to see if there are ways we can work together. I’ll be honest—some of my friends in Washington aren’t happy about this. But refusing to talk gets the 12.5 million workers I represent nothing. I will never stop trying to reach agreement. I will never stop trying to compromise the right way for the right reasons. Unions do this every day. Teachers and coal miners and actors and football players sit across from their employers and negotiate a fair deal. Sometimes a deal cannot be reached. Sometimes one side refuses to bargain in good faith. But most times, an agreement is achieved that allows workers to share in the wealth they helped create and management to run a successful business. The AFL-CIO—where I am proud to serve as president—is pushing to expand this right to all workers. We believe every worker, everybody, deserves a job and the power to make it a good job, to bargain for higher wages, safer working conditions and retirement security. Whether you’re black or white. Whether you’re gay or straight. Whether you’re immigrant or native-born. Whether you’re union or not yet union. Over the last few decades, as union membership has declined, so have wages and standards for working people. This is not a coincidence. Giving all workers the right to bargain for a better life will help close the opportunity gap. It will create an expanded platform for negotiation and compromise and mutually beneficial partnerships. And it will make our democracy stronger.I encourage you to embrace fair compromise in every facet of your life. Before you send that snarky e-mail, pick up the phone and talk it out. If you’ve reached an impasse with a friend or family member, do your part to make it right. Clean up your side of the street. If you are able to, let someone off the hook. Give rather than take. Serve rather than expect. See that your neighbors have the same hopes and dreams that you do; remember, there is more that unites us than divides us.These are the American principles that make us who we are, and these are the principles we are counting on you to restore. You didn’t break it, but we’re asking you to fix it.In these challenging times, I encourage you to listen, not lash out. To dream, not fear. To live and love and laugh. Don’t take a single day for granted on this Earth. Remember, this is the only life we will ever get. President Teddy Roosevelt said nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care. Class of 2017, you are now graduates of Penn State. Show the world how much you care. Be heroic. Be kind. Be yourself. And don’t forget, the best is yet to come. Thank you so much!© 2023 AFL-CIO.

289,Trumka Rallies Against Republican Health Care Scam ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-rallies-against-republican-health-care-scam,5-4-2017,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka today made the following remarks at a rally to save health care:Good afternoon, brothers and sisters. I’m Rich Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. I am proud to be here on behalf of the American labor movement. We oppose the Republican health care bill. It’s bad for workers. It’s bad for unions. It’s bad for America.It doubles down on taxing our health plans. It threatens Medicare and Medicaid. And it further tilts our economy toward the wealthiest few. In fact, this isn’t a health care plan at all. It’s a massive transfer of wealth from workers to Wall Street. My message to every single member of Congress is this: if you vote to destroy our health care this year, we’ll vote to elect your replacement next year. Working people simply will not tolerate this kind of betrayal. Now, we understand the Affordable Care Act needs to be improved. We stand ready to make it better—to cover more people and lower costs. But repeal is retreat. And this replacement is even worse—it’s surrender, eliminating health care for 24 million Americans. The labor movement has been fighting for universal health care for the last century. We want health care for all, not the few. Every single major country guarantees health care as a right. Yet America—the richest country in the world at our richest time in history—is having a debate about what to cut. No more. We demand better. We will fight for better. We will march for better. We will vote for better. Unions are all in. Defeat this bill. We want health care for all, and we want it now! Thank you very much.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
290,Trumka Pledges Solidarity at Steelworkers Convention,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-pledges-solidarity-steelworkers-convention,4-11-2017,"Good afternoon. Thank you, Brother Fred [Redmond] for your kind words of introduction. I’m honored to be here.During last year’s election, I had the pleasure of campaigning with Steelworkers and other union folks all over the country. We had candid conversations about the importance of taking a stand for good jobs, and, I’ll be honest, I spoke to some union members who supported Hillary Clinton and others who planned to vote for Donald Trump. Yet whoever we voted for, every single person I spoke to wanted the same thing.  A fairer economy. New rules. A better life.If the election had been a referendum on a stronger union movement, a new direction on trade, good jobs and a brighter future for ourselves and our families, we would have won in a landslide.But it wasn’t. The election was between two human beings, imperfect as all of us are, and we owe it to our members and to America to do everything we can to win progress from this new administration, just as we did with the last. From my very first meeting with President Trump, I let him know that we will judge his White House on actions. We’re watching. We’re keeping score. If the president does something good for all working people, something consistent with our values, we’ll support it and work hard for it. If he does something that threatens who we are and what we stand for, we are going to fight it as a unified labor movement.We did the same thing with President Obama, and if any of your members have doubts about that, just remind them of our years-long campaign against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Obama was a great president, but he was wrong on trade, and we stood against him and prevailed. President Trump talked a good game on trade and even signed the TPP’s death certificate on his first day in office. But we killed that bad trade deal once and for all, and we’ll do the same to any new deal if it fails our standards.NAFTA is the real test. President Trump made this a major focus of his campaign. Time and time again, he called it the worst trade deal in history, and nothing resonated with union members more. Yet it now seems the Trump Administration could leave NAFTA’s most oppressive pieces in place.Our unions plan to play a large role in the renegotiation of NAFTA, and the Steelworkers will be at the front of the fight. Nobody knows trade like the USW. Working together, we will demand a better deal and make certain this process is not used to further tilt the rules in favor of big corporations. Our message to President Trump is this: Keep your promise. Rewrite NAFTA so it works for workers. Bring our jobs back.These corporate-written deals have torn apart our country for too long. Working people want a new direction. We saw it with the TPP. America is ready for something better. We’re ending the era of bad trade, and we’re doing it now!One thing I love about the United Steelworkers is how you put union education front and center. You know it’s critical, now more than ever, to build from the inside out. Working people need to understand how our economy isn’t like the weather. It’s not just something that happens to us. We can make a difference with activism.Activism is built on issues. That’s why we’re putting our issues first. We’ve been asserting our political independence, and we’re not going to stop. It’s not enough for us to wish for a better life. We’ve got to win it.With our issues in the lead, partisan politics has to take a back seat. We won’t be an ATM for any political party. When our fidelity is to working people and fair economic rules, politicians will have to come to us. That’s how we’ll stop choosing on Election Day between the lesser of two evils and start choosing between the better of two goods.So let’s talk issues.We are just beyond the 80-day mark of this administration, and two very different factions have emerged. There is a Wall Street wing that seeks to undermine Donald Trump’s promises to workers, and a competing wing that could win much-needed progress for working people.President Trump needs to decide who he stands with. The steelworkers, coal miners, farmers and other regular Americans who he promised to help in the campaign, or the Wall Street billionaires who rigged the economy at our expense? This decision will be the single greatest test of his presidency.Quite frankly, I am concerned that the Wall Street wing of the White House has hijacked the agenda.President Trump has already rolled back important federal regulations that keep us safe on the job. His executive orders on immigration criminalize our workplaces and violate our basic principles. And by delaying the fiduciary rule which says financial advisers must act in your best interest, working people could lose more than a quarter of our retirement savings.Then there’s the attack on our health care.We opposed the American Health Care Act because it was an all-out attack on workers’ health care security—taking money away from Medicare and Medicaid, increasing the number of uninsured and taxing our health plans. We want health care for all, not the few.We beat that bad bill, and it sent a powerful message: If you pull a bait and switch on working people—you will fail.If Congress wants to pass something on health care, they should start by repealing the unfair and unnecessary Cadillac Tax. We’d fight for that. It would pass. I guarantee it!We are bringing this same focus and determination to the issue of infrastructure. I’m glad President Trump proposed a $1 trillion investment in our roads and bridges. This is the right scale to be talking about, and the labor movement is ready to help turn proposals into shovel-ready projects with the most highly skilled and well-trained workforce in the world. But it matters how we raise the money and how we spend it. Infrastructure dollars must uphold high labor standards, good wages and other protections. A good plan must use public money—new money—to support American jobs, American resources and American steel!On every single issue, I’ve given President Trump our ideas and suggestions. I’ve asked him to follow through on his campaign pledges by laying out a vision that reflects America’s priorities, one that raises wages, keeps workers safe, protects retirement security, strengthens unions and provides opportunity for all.Even before taking office, President Trump used his bully pulpit to tell companies to stay put. I don’t need to tell you this—Carrier was his biggest target. Look, every president should fight to keep good jobs here, because every single job saved means one more family can pay down the mortgage, save for college or retire with dignity.But it is not enough to simply demand companies stay in America if the jobs ultimately saved provide low wages and little voice. President Trump should use his office and influence to call for an end to workplace intimidation, reject “right to work” once and for all and promote and protect the freedom of every single worker to form or join a union and bargain for a better life.To put it another way: stop listening to Goldman Sachs and start listening to Chuck Jones.This is America, the richest country in the world at our richest time in history. Everybody should have the right to a job and the power to make it a good job, and that means you should be able to bargain with your employer, whether you’re in a union or not.We know the reality of labor today. We know how the law only requires employers to bargain with recognized unions. So listen: We are proposing something bold. Something big. Something better. Every worker, everybody, deserves a job and the power to make it a good job, to bargain for higher wages, safe working conditions and retirement security. Whether you’re black or white, gay or straight, immigrant or native-born, union or not-yet-union.

If you tend crops in North Carolina or clean hotel rooms here in Las Vegas, if you’re an engineer in Seattle or a steelworker in Pennsylvania, you should have the right to bargain with your coworkers for a better life. And employers must abide by that right.Some might say this is radical. I say it is fundamental. And there has never been a more important time for workers to assert our collective power. In the months ahead, we will apply this innovation in the real world to win real gains.When all workers have a say in our pay and working conditions, we will start to close the gap between the rich and the rest of us. We will lift up families and communities. We will build the America our founders envisioned, our parents built and our children deserve.As I speak about the gains we can win and the power we can build, I’m not asking any of us to disregard reality. It won’t be easy. We face long odds. But nothing is set in stone. The future is ours to shape.And it all starts with solidarity.I’m talking about real solidarity, not empty gestures and bandwagon posturing. The type of solidarity where the outcome is still uncertain and it may cost you something in the short-term. Solidarity is most important when times are tough and disagreements are strong—when the sun isn’t shining. How we respond to the challenges and opportunities of today and in the days to come will define who and what we are as a labor movement and a nation.We can’t lose sight of the big picture: The momentum is swinging our way. Collective action is on the rise. America is in the midst of an overdue national conversation about income inequality. There is strong demand for good jobs, fair trade and raising pay. A powerful majority of Americans support unions, and our popularity is growing, especially among young people.Whether its trade, infrastructure, wages, immigration or health care, unions are ready to be part of the solution.We know the way forward. Collective action is part of the national conversation now, and that’s a good thing. Don’t get me wrong. Our opponents are bold. They’re well-funded and ruthless. They’re going to come after us and keep up the fight. I say, bring it on!Unionism works. Solidarity is the strongest thing in this world.America is hungry for change.We’ll fight for it. We’ll stand for it. We’ll win it, brothers and sisters, because we’re the ones who wake America up every single day, and put her to bed at night. We roll the steel. We make the tires. We build the roads and stoke the fires. We’ll stand strong. We’ll never run and hide. We’re the American labor movement, and we will not be denied!Thank you. God bless you, God bless your families and members and all the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka

Thank you, Brother Sito [Pantoja] for your kind words of introduction. I am proud to work closely with you, and President Martinez and the entire Machinists Union to build a stronger and fairer America.During last year’s election, I had the pleasure of campaigning with Machinists and other union folks all over the country. We had candid conversations about the importance of taking a stand for good jobs, and, I’ll be honest, I spoke to some union members who supported Hillary Clinton and others who planned to vote for Donald Trump. Yet whoever we voted for, every single person I spoke to wanted the same thing. A fairer economy. New rules.

The election was between two human beings, imperfect as all of us are, and while the Trump Administration may be unorthodox, we will neither jump on the anti-Trump bandwagon nor join the Trump parade. I think we owe it to our members and to America to do everything we can to win progress from this new administration, just as we did with the last… and will do with the next.From my very first meeting with President Trump, I let him know that we come forward with an open mind. We will judge his administration by its actions. We’re watching. We’re keeping score.

Now President Trump may have signed the TPP’s death certificate on his first day in office, but we killed that bad trade deal once and for all, and we’ll do the same to any new deal if it fails our standards.Well, an outline of President Trump’s plans on NAFTA came out the other day, and quite frankly, it barely tinkers around the edges and leaves the worst stuff in place. So what happens next? Will the president abandon his main promise to America’s workers? We won’t just wait and see.Our unions plan to play a large role in the renegotiation of NAFTA. We won’t just sit back and complain. We’ve already put forward solid solutions with data to back them up. We will not allow the reopening of existing trade deals to be the latest excuse to further tilt the rules in favor of big corporations. Our message to President Trump is this: Keep your promise. Rewrite NAFTA so it works for workers. Bring our jobs back.These corporate trade deals have torn us apart for too long. Working people want a new direction.  We’re ending the era of bad trade, and we’re doing it now!One thing I love about the Machinists is your activism. You know it’s critical, now more than ever, to build our power from the inside out. Working people need to be educated about how politics affects every aspect of our jobs and our lives. The economy isn’t like the weather. It’s not just something that happens to us. We can help shape it with activism.Activism is built on issues. That’s why we’re putting our issues first. We’ve been asserting our political independence, and we’re not going to stop. It’s not enough for us to wish for a better life. We’ve got to win it.With our issues in the lead, partisan politics has to take a back seat. We won’t be an ATM for any political party. When our fidelity is to working people and working people only. when we demand fair economic rules and really do step forward to work with anybody, the politicians will have to come to us. That’s how we’ll stop choosing on Election Day between the lesser of two evils and start choosing between the better of two goods.So let’s talk issues.We are now at the 80-day mark of this administration, and two very different factions have emerged. There is a Wall Street wing that seeks to undermine Donald Trump’s promises to workers, and a competing wing that could win some much-needed progress for working people.President Trump needs to decide who he stands with. The machinists, rail workers, farmers, miners. steelworkers, autoworkers and other regular Americans who he promised to help in the campaign, or the Wall Street billionaires who rigged the economy at our expense.

I’ve asked him to follow through on his campaign pledges by laying out a vision that reflects America’s priorities,  one that raises wages, keeps workers safe, protects retirement security, strengthens unions and provides opportunity for all.That’s why we are pushing to make it a federal offense to assault customer service representatives, and protect Amtrak funding, and invest public dollars in high speed rail. These policies make a real difference in the lives of workers. They’re worth fighting for. They’re worth winning.Flight attendants need a minimum 10 hours rest. Freight rail workers need two-man crews, whistleblower protections and fatigue regulations. Otherwise, real trains with real cargo on rai lines in real communities, our communities, are in serious danger.Remember, this is real life we’re talking about. Even before taking office, President Trump used his bully pulpit to tell companies to stay put. Look, every president should fight to keep good jobs here, because every single job saved means one more family can pay down the mortgage, save for college or retire with dignity.But it is not enough to simply demand companies stay in America if the jobs ultimately saved provide low wages and little voice. President Trump should use his office and influence to call for an end to workplace intimidation, reject “right to work” once and for all and promote and protect the freedom of every single worker to form or join a union and bargain for a better life.

292,Labor’s Future: Bargaining for All,https://aflcio.org/speeches/labors-future-bargaining-all,4-4-2017,"AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka delivered the following remarks at the National Press Club: 

Good afternoon. It is an honor to be here on behalf of the 55 unions and 12.5 million members of the AFL-CIO to talk about how to win progress for America’s working people.As I start, I’d like to note that today is Equal Pay Day. For anyone unfamiliar, this is not a celebration. It’s a reminder that for a woman to earn as much as a man, she has to work a full year, plus an extra 100 days, all the way to April 4. For women of color, it’s even longer.The pay gap between women and men is one symptom of a much larger problem. Our economy is historically out of balance, tilted steeply against working people and in favor of corporations.In each of the last three years, corporate profits have reached record highs, one year after the other, yet workers haven’t gotten a real raise in half a century. Corporate CEOs are making more than three hundred times the average worker. And despite living in the richest country in the world at its richest point in history, our overall standard of living is going down. This is a moral and an economic crisis.You see, the imbalance in our economy causes regular people real pain. Mothers and fathers are forced to choose between paying the rent and paying the doctor. Consumers are being cheated out of hard-earned money. Seniors are taking jobs instead of enjoying retirement. These are the realities for working people while corporations cart more and more riches to the bank.So how did we get here?Republicans, and too many Democrats, have rigged our economy to enrich a select few at the expense of everyday, hard-working Americans. It has been a direct assault on our deeply held national values of unity, justice and broad opportunity. It’s been done under the guise of creating jobs and justified by a fanatical economic theory that seeks to remove or destroy anything seen as a barrier to the free market, most especially unions.We see it in our trade deals that create special rights for corporations. We see it in our health care system that is a windfall for insurance companies and a complicated, unaffordable mess for patients and families. We see it in our financial sector that has become the master, not the servant, of the real economy.Above all, we see it in our outdated labor laws that allow employers to steal wages and unfairly restrict the freedom of workers to form unions.But inequality is not inevitable. Inequality is a choice. And we can choose to do better.Let me be perfectly clear—we will never solve the problem unless every worker has the power to bargain with their employer. Nothing else raises wages better or more fairly.Now it would seem that the Bill of Rights—with its freedoms of speech and assembly—affords every worker the right to bargain with their employer. But that is not how the system works in practice.The law today only requires employers to bargain with recognized unions, so we are proposing something bold. Something better. Every worker, everybody, deserves a job and the power to make it a good job, to bargain for higher wages, safer working conditions and retirement security. Whether you’re black or white. Whether you're gay or straight. Whether you're immigrant or native-born. Whether you're union or not yet union.If you tend crops in North Carolina or clean hotel rooms in New York City, if you’re an engineer in Seattle or an autoworker in Mississippi, you should have the right to bargain with your coworkers for a better life. And employers should have to abide by that right.Some might say this is radical. Quite frankly, I say it's the most fundamental thing there can be. And there has never been a more important time for workers to assert our collective power.When all workers have a say in our pay and working conditions, we will start to close that gap. We will lift up more families and communities. We will build the America our founders envisioned, our parents built and our children deserve.This is what the vast majority of Americans cried out for in 2016—whether they voted for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. New economic rules. A new way of doing business. Changing an economy so that it worked for them. We are closing in on the first 100 days of President Trump’s administration, and two very different factions have emerged. There is a Wall Street wing that seeks to undermine Donald Trump’s promises to workers, and a competing wing that could actually win some progress that working people need.President Trump needs to decide who he stands with. The coal miners, farmers, steelworkers and other regular Americans who he promised to help in his campaign, or the Wall Street tycoons who are rigging the economy at our expense. That decision will be the single greatest test and the most defining thing of his presidency.Even before taking office, President Trump used his bully pulpit to tell companies to stay put. A few have listened. And that’s a good thing. Every president should fight to keep good jobs here, because every single job saved means one more family can pay down the mortgage, save for college or retire with dignity.But it is not enough simply to demand companies stay in America if the jobs that are ultimately saved provide low wages and little voice. President Trump should use his office and influence to call for an end to workplace intimidation, reject “right to work” once and for all and promote and protect the freedom of every single worker to form or join a union and bargain for a better life.Tweet that. Fight for that. Accomplish that. That’s how we’ll make America great!From my very first meeting with President Trump, I let him know that we will judge his administration by its actions. We’re watching. We’re keeping score. If the president does something good for all working people, something consistent with our values, we’ll support it and work hard for it. If he does something that threatens who we are and what we stand for, we are going to fight it, as a unified labor movement.This isn’t just talk.We opposed the American Health Care Act because it was an all-out attack on workers’ health care security—taking money away from Medicare and Medicaid, increasing the number of uninsured and taxing our health plans. We want health care for all, not the few.By defeating that bad legislation, we sent a powerful message. If you pull a bait and switch on working people—if you say you are with us and then attack us, you will fail.We are applying this same standard to the important issues of the day.We were thankful that President Trump signed the TPP’s death certificate. But working people killed that unfair agreement. We did that. NAFTA is the real test, and despite the president calling it the worst trade deal in history, it appears the Trump Administration could leave its most oppressive pieces in place.President Trump has proposed a $1 trillion investment in America’s infrastructure. This is the right scale to be talking about, and the labor movement is ready to hit the ground running. But will we invest the right way—with high wages and standards for the workers who build our roads and bridges?Just last week, the Republican House voted to eliminate PLAs on all federal projects. What will he do with that? Will he sign it or will he veto it?Quite frankly, I am concerned that the Wall Street wing of the White House is starting to hijack the agenda.President Trump has already rolled back important federal regulations that keep us safe on the job. His executive orders on immigration criminalize our workplaces and violate our basic principles. And by delaying the fiduciary rule which says financial advisers must act in your best interest, working people could lose more than a quarter of our retirement money.Then there’s the president’s budget. In the end, a budget is a more than a set of numbers. It’s a values document. It’s how we know if you put your money where your mouth is. And this budget fails that test.You can’t say you’re for working people when your budget starves programs like the Appalachian commission and the Delta Regional Authority, which train workers and grow local economies.You can’t say you’re for working people when your budget cuts infrastructure dollars for hundreds of necessary projects like upgrading Route 640 in Elkhorn City, Kentucky—their lifeline.        You can’t say you’re for working people when your budget slashes funding for OSHA and MSHA while 150 workers die every single day from workplace injuries or illnesses like silica dust and other toxins.These are the wrong priorities, the wrong values, but there truly is a different path.Down in the mountain valleys of southwestern Pennsylvania, where I grew up, poverty and a lack of opportunity were once brutal facts of life. Yet when I was a kid, the local public school gave us a top-quality education, and college was an affordable reality. Back then our economy worked better for working families, largely because of the wages and benefits bargained by workers in unions, like mine, the United Mine Workers of America.Today UMWA retirees are on Capitol Hill lobbying for a fair retirement deal. Over 20,000 health care cut-off notices have been sent out and benefits are set to expire on April 30. We have a responsibility to keep our promise to America’s coal miners. Congress should send the Miners Protection Act to President Trump’s desk today.Mining was a dangerous and difficult job and my family was not rich by any stretch. But unionism gave us a ladder to the middle class, and I got to climb it.For too many people, that ladder is gone. We’re going to have to rebuild it. Rung by rung.We want to rebuild the ladder and change the rules of our economy for workers like Michael Smith. Michael worked at the Oreo plant on the South Side of Chicago. Yet Mondelez, the parent company of Nabisco, decided to move his job to Mexico. And NAFTA helped pave the way.Michael is with us today. Please stand, Mike. Thank you, my brother. The members of Mike’s union, the Bakery Workers, want to make Oreos in the United States. This isn’t just about a few cookies. That factory is an icon. It was a place where you could make decent wages and raise a family, and places like that should not be a thing of the past.Irene Rosenfeld, the CEO of Mondelez, makes over $9,000 an hour. She just went over the $200 million mark that she's taken out of the company. For her. One person. $9,000 an hour and in that same hour, Nabisco workers in Mexico earn barely more than a dollar. One dollar. That's simply unacceptable.President Trump, do what’s right. Stand with us. Stand with Michael. Stand with the Bakery Workers. Bring the jobs home, protect our pensions and invest in America. That's what you said you were going to do. Building an economy that works for everyone requires putting our issues and our values first. We will not be an ATM for any political party. We will stand up to the corporate Republicans who attack working people and the neoliberal Democrats who take us for granted. When our fidelity is to working people and fair economic rules, politicians will have to come to us. That’s how we’ll stop choosing on Election Day between the lesser of two evils and start choosing between the better of two goods.Momentum has been building for working people over the last few years. People want good jobs. They want fair trade. They want rising pay. A powerful majority of Americans support unions, and our popularity is growing, especially among young people.As I speak about unionism, and the gains we can win and the power we can build, I’m not asking any of us to disregard reality. I know it won’t be easy. I know we face long odds. But nothing is set in stone... nothing. The future is truly ours to shape.  Because in the labor movement, we understand that quality jobs don’t just grow on trees. They don't just happen. Mining and factory jobs used to be dangerous and dirty. We made them better by standing together. Solidarity works. Unity works. It’s as American as apple pie, but better. When we stand together, we win, and our success spreads.It’s happening right now, as we sit here. Workers are organizing for a seat at the table and a chance to improve pay and benefits. EMTs and paramedics here in D.C. recently joined the State, County and Municipal Employees. Hard-working women and men at an electric bus factory in Los Angeles won recognition with the Sheet Metal Workers. Employees at Baltimore Gas and Electric said yes to the Electrical Workers. Thousands of teaching and research assistants at Columbia and Yale voted for a voice on the job with the United Auto Workers and UNITE HERE respectively—and more are on the way. And speaking of UNITE HERE, Trump hotel workers in Las Vegas not only secured a first contract, they won a union at Trump International Hotel just a few blocks from this club. That’s our movement—workers of all skills and backgrounds coming together in pursuit of a common goal.As I close, I want to mention a recent study from Harvard. It showed that only 30 percent of those born in the 1980s believe it’s essential to live in a democratic nation. This is a startling statistic. I believe it reflects the simple truth that young people are bearing the brunt of our economic imbalance. The American idea that anything is possible if you work hard and play by the rules, has been fading away for this generation and too many others.The labor movement can and must change this. We are in the fight of our lives—to reclaim America as a land of opportunity. And we have never been more committed to getting the job done right now.In the end, it all comes down to this: Everybody deserves a good job and the power to win better wages, benefits and retirement security, whether you’re in a union or not. That's how we build an economy that works.President Trump, the labor movement is moving forward. You should join us, sooner rather than later. Use the power of your office to help us raise wages, strengthen unions and give all workers a better life. You do that. And we'll take it from there. Thank you very much.

293,"Trumka Outlines Proactive, Pro-Worker Agenda to Operative Plasterers and Cement Masons",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-outlines-proactive-pro-worker-agenda-operative-plasterers-and-cement-masons,3-16-2017,"Thank you, President [Dan] Stepano.  Congratulations.  You’re a powerful leader at a crucial time, and I’m proud to stand beside you and every member of your storied union.Listen, these are challenging times for our labor movement and our nation.  Pay is too low. Inequality is too high.  Good jobs are few and far between.  But over the past four or five years, something has changed.  Working people are speaking out.  We are shaping the debate.  We want better.  And we are making one thing abundantly clear: we do not work for any politician or political party.  We will not be an ATM for the Democrats or a rubber stamp for the Republicans. We will lead with our issues and our values.  We will put our members and families first. Political independence is the way forward.  It will strengthen our credibility and effectiveness. And that’s how we build an America that works for working people.Political independence allowed us to take on a Democratic president and defeat the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Political independence empowered us to stand up to a Republican president and defeat a no-good, wage-stealing, robot-loving nominee for Secretary of Labor.  In both cases, we rallied in towns and cities across the country, flooded Congress with calls and e-mails and made our position clear.  And we won.  Remember that.  We won.Working people are leading the way.  We’re building a political movement for good jobs and better lives.  There is nothing more important in America right now.  For decades, our economy has been tilted to favor the wealthy few at our expense.  The vast majority of Americans want the rules of the economy to benefit us, not the rich, not the wealthy, not Wall Street.  That’s what we are pushing for.Good jobs and raising wages is how we will measure the Trump Administration.  President Trump promised throughout his campaign to make life better for American workers.  But talk is cheap.  When the president does something good for working people and good for the economy, we’ll say so, and we’ll work for it.  When he does things that are bad for working people and bad for the economy, that lower our wages and make our workplaces less safe, that threaten our pensions and health care, we will fight him every step of the way.  President Trump gets to choose his path.  In us, he will either have a constructive partner or an unrelenting, resourceful and tough opponent.We’re building a movement, brothers and sisters.  It’s a powerful movement where unions grow and inequality shrinks.  It’s a movement where you can grab onto the American Dream no matter what you look like, where you come from, how much money your parents have or who you love.When it comes to doing right for working people, we define that vision.  We embody those values.  We will fix what’s broken in our country.  We have unity.  We have solidarity.  And we are ready to win justice and jobs today and a better tomorrow.Brothers and sisters, the Operative Plasterers and Cement Masons are a great union.  You know that.  You’re the original Helmets to Hardhats program, dating back to the Civil War.  I love your history, and your work ethic.  Excellence is your watchword.  Your apprentice programs are top-notch.  And I’m glad to hear your employment outlook is good.I want to talk to you for a few minutes about solidarity and union strength, and I want to talk to you about divisions.All through this last election campaign, as I worked hard for our union-endorsed candidates, I spoke to union members who planned to vote for Donald Trump.  The AFL-CIO studied the situation and made a different recommendation, but I respect each and every one of those individuals, and I would stand by them through thick and thin.  Far more important than who we vote for is our shared interests and our shared values.  Every single member I talked to wanted a stronger union, better jobs and higher wages.Over the past few months, I’ve had conversations with union leaders and union members who want pipelines, and I’ve spoken with others who are dead set against them.  That’s okay.  We can disagree.  But at the end of the day, when it comes to building a more effective labor movement and a stronger America, we must always stand together, arms locked in solidarity.That’s how we’ll win the big fights on trade, on jobs, on workers’ rights.  And it’s how we must continue to push back against attacks on our health care, like the so-called Cadillac Tax.  This ugly and unfair tax hits working people directly, and it will destroy our health plans.  We have given up wage increases time and time again to preserve our health care.  We fought for it.  We bargained for it.  We earned it.  This tax was a bad idea when Democrats included it in the Affordable Care Act.  It’s a bad idea now that Republicans are pushing it.  For more than a century, the labor movement has fought to make health care a right for every American.  Congress should focus on improving and building on the Affordable Care Act, our current employment-based system, Medicare and Medicaid.  Brothers and sisters, if you come after our health care, we will fight you tooth and nail.Playing defense is important.  But we also need a proactive, pro-worker agenda.  In his speech to Congress, President Trump proposed a massive infrastructure investment — $1 trillion dollars. We’ve wanted that for years.  It’s an important proposal, and America needs it, but it had better come with Davis-Bacon and powerful Buy America provisions.  We’ll gladly partner with President Trump for every single thing that working families need.  But I had to wonder about all of those Congressional Republicans who stood up and cheered for investing in infrastructure. Where were they for the last 8 years when President Obama was proposing the very same thing? This is the type of partisan politics that drive our members crazy.  So my message to Congress is this: Cut the crap.  Pass a bill.  Do it the right way.  Put America to work.We can, and we will, win a new set of rules for the American economy.  It won’t be easy, but nothing worth doing ever is.  And if for a minute you think it can’t be done, just consider that two years ago everybody and their brother thought the TPP was a done deal.  And just a few weeks ago Andy Puzder looked like a slam dunk to be the next Secretary of Labor.But working people had a different idea.  We mobilized.  We educated workers, and in the end, we came out on top.  We learned a powerful lesson: nothing is inevitable.  We saw activism work.America wants more of that activism, not less.  By a margin of two to one, registered voters want to increase Social Security benefits.  By a margin of 3 to 1, folks want to tax companies on overseas profits and increase funding for public schools.  People overwhelmingly support higher wages and more investments in infrastructure.  And a growing number believe in unions!  Make no mistake, momentum is on our side.We can win everything we need to build a better life.  Our vision will lift us all up.   We can do it, because we’re the ones who drive the buses and run the trains.  We build the bridges and lift the loads.  We teach the classes and care for the sick.  We build America, and defend her.  We do America’s work.  We make America go.  We want our share of the American Dream, brothers and sisters, and we’ll stand for it.  We’ll march for it. We’ll win it!Brothers and sisters, America remains the wealthiest nation in the history of the world.  We can support middle-class jobs and succeed.  We can be pro-worker and pro-business.  We can trade fairly and form unions freely.  That’s what America is all about.  But it will take hard work and solidarity.Any economist will tell you consumer spending drives 70% of the American economy.  When workers earn a living wage, we are more likely to buy a new washing machine, replace the tires on the car or take a long-overdue vacation.  That’s why the best way to build a strong, sustainable economy is with wage-driven growth.  When I help you up, it gives me a boost. When you help me up, the way gets easier for somebody else.  It’s not easy.  When it counts, solidarity is hard.  We’ve got to stand together during the long night, when it’s cold, when the outcome is uncertain.  That’s when it matters.  Solidarity.  Arms locked.  Shoulder-to-shoulder. To win a better life!That’s the American way.  It’s the union way.  It’s solidarity, and it works, brothers and sisters. You know how to win for America’s hard-working families.  You’ve done it many, many times, and you’ll do it again tomorrow.  When we stand together, we win together.Thank you, and God bless you and the work you do.

294,Shuler at Third Way: Nuclear Power is Good for the Labor Movement,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-third-way-nuclear-power-good-labor-movement,2-21-2017,"Good morning and thank you to Third Way for hosting this event, and inviting the AFL-CIO to share our views on the future of nuclear energy. As a federation of 56 unions representing 12.5 million workers, we are committed to standing up together for workers, our communities and higher standards for everyone. That’s exactly what brings me here today.The promotion of nuclear energy, whether in existing facilities or the successful development of new generations, is good for the labor movement and good for America. The AFL-CIO, my own union— the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers -  the United Association, the Utility Workers, the Boilermakers and the Steelworkers all believe nuclear should be at the forefront of any clean energy strategy.  While we are working hard to make sure that our current nuclear facilities prosper, with recent victories in New York and Illinois, we are also keeping a close eye on the future of nuclear technology, including advanced Generation IV and small modular reactors.I will be blunt—if we are not successful in enacting the energy and economic policies that ensure new reactors are designed and produced here in the United States, we will lose a generations-long opportunity for good jobs and clean, American-made energy.We can and should work hard to extend the life of our current nuclear fleet, reduce the costs of oversight and value the carbon-free baseload electricity these plants provide. However, the long-term future of nuclear is in small modular reactors, where we just had a significant milestone with NuScale applying to have its design certified, and in the Generation IV technology that is under intense development now. We in the labor movement believe strongly that these technologies will succeed, and that it is highly likely they will be used in the United States. The question is whether they will be produced here by our workers and our companies or if this opportunity will be lost to competitors like China and Russia. The possibility of the United States being dependent on foreign governments for civilian nuclear technologies should concern all of us across the political spectrum. We can’t let it happen. Yes, jobs are at stake, good jobs, high-paying jobs, union jobs. The labor movement is proud to provide the highest quality labor at nuclear facilities, trained and educated through private funds negotiated in our collective bargaining agreements. And why not? The nuclear industry supplies high quality, long-term, steady work that usually pays one-third more than the average job surrounding a plant. These are the type of family-sustaining careers the American people are demanding more of.Successfully bringing advanced nuclear technologies to market with an American workforce and an American supply chain will create good jobs across the occupational spectrum, from engineers and scientists—including the amazing members of the International Federation of Technical and Professional Employees, to skilled construction crafts, to manufacturing and the specialty metals industry. And we are already involved, contributing to the design phase for small modular reactors so that the systems are designed in a way that helps lower the cost of manufacturing and assembly, and cuts the time needed to complete the job. We are ready to do what we have always done—supply the best labor, update our educational programs to incorporate new tools and techniques and make sure we are in the best position to maintain a plentiful, productive nuclear workforce. Let me leave you with two high-level policy priorities that the labor movement believes will move this industry forward. First, we must update the federal policy framework for nuclear power to preserve existing nuclear capacity, rebuild our supply chain capacity, build and license next-generation and modular reactors, and both modernize and adequately fund fuel-cycle activities. Second, we believe strongly in the need for full tax and policy parity for both zero-carbon and carbon-capturing generation sources. Federal and state incentives for wind and solar generation are distorting electricity markets in ways that slow progress toward reducing electricity-sector emissions from base-load power. We can slow climate change and create domestic employment with equal treatment for all sources of greenhouse gas avoidance in the power sector.I want to again thank everyone here today for your commitment to making the future of nuclear an American success story—with good jobs, high wages, clean energy and stronger unions. The labor movement stands ready to put our shoulder to the wheel and get this industry rolling. Working together, I know we can achieve our goals. Thank you.

295,Trumka to Pilots: Solidarity is the Best Way Forward,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-pilots-solidarity-best-way-forward,2-8-2017,"Thank you, Brother Tim [Canoll], for your friendship and your leadership. It’s wonderful to join you at this pivotal time in America’s history. I’m excited to talk to your new leaders.When I’m done, I look forward to your questions, thoughts and ideas. Let’s make this a real conversation. I’m told you will be able to either step up to one of the microphones or text a question to the number behind me, and Captain Canoll can pass it along.Listen, I am very fortunate to lead the AFL-CIO. It’s the greatest honor of my life. But I’ve never stopped being an organizer. I’ve never stopped being a rep. I’ve never forgotten what I learned on the safety committee of my union, the United Mine Workers of America.In your union work, each of you is going to determine the future of our labor movement. You have the power—and the responsibility. Your staff and elected leaders will give you tools and support, and I certainly offer my guidance and experience. But it is you on the ground—and in the air—who will make our movement go forward.We are fighting for the future of the American Dream. And when it comes to working for a better life, a union contract is where the rubber meets the road. When working people stand together—from pilots and engineers to nurses and coal miners—we can bargain for what’s fair. You know what I’m talking about. Wages. Safety. Benefits. Pensions. A voice.As new union reps, your job is to make sure our collective bargaining agreements are respected and enforced. That’s weighty stuff. The decisions you make and the actions you take will have a profound impact on the work and lives of your members.Looking at you, I think about my own role early on. It changed me, and I believe it will change you, too. You’ll gain a deeper appreciation for the importance of our basic democratic freedoms on the job. You’ll stand up more quickly and forcefully against unsafe or unfair treatment. You’ll be more careful to listen to every side of an argument. As you serve, you’ll strengthen your union, and our entire labor movement. I wouldn’t be surprised if one or more of you goes on to lead a local union or federation. Trust me, the American labor movement needs all the dedicated leaders we can get.Now, I couldn’t come here without talking about politics. And I am happy to discuss it more during Q&A.Politically, we’re growing increasingly independent. That doesn’t mean we’ll shy away from the debate. We’re as involved as ever. We’re simply asserting ourselves in a more constructive way. We’re putting our issues and our values out front.We can’t and won’t make politics personal. We need jobs. We believe each and every one of us should be able to work hard, play by the rules and earn a decent life. In return, we want what’s fair. That’s not too much to ask.In one of his very first actions, President Trump did something that I applauded. He withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the massive trade deal that two years ago everyone thought was a slam dunk. Regardless of your feelings about President Trump or Hillary Clinton, both had vowed to pull us from this bad agreement. The fact that both major party candidates campaigned against bad corporate trade deals is really remarkable. In many ways, it marks the beginning of a new era in our country.That shift was no accident. Working people from coast to coast made calls, wrote letters, lobbied Congress and let our leaders know enough is enough. We stood united. The men and women in power listened, and now we are moving in a better direction.Yet today, there is no denying that America is divided, and few people are more divisive than our president. Even the question of whether he’s divisive is divisive. Hardly anything can separate the people in a room more than the subject of Donald Trump, but let me tell you something: we can’t let who we voted for separate us in this room, because what happens over the next four years will affect every one of us and everyone we know. It’ll be our responsibility to try to derail the bad things and lift up the good things.Take Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, for example. She has the potential to do a lot of good for transportation in America, but it’s up to us to push her to fix the flawed policy that has allowed Norwegian Air to operate a low-road air service flying a flag of convenience. The Norwegian permit is bad for American jobs. It’s sets a bad precedent. It’s unsafe. And we’re going to put a stop to it!You see, our fidelity is not to a political party. We serve the men and women we represent, and the priorities that mean the most, like the safety of our aircraft and our pay and benefits. We want to have a hand in crafting regulations that affect us. We want a seat at the table.In these challenging times, we must stand together. Solidarity—in pursuit of our issues and our values—is the best way forward. Any politician who thinks they’re going to tear down America’s air safety standards for a quick buck has another think coming. That idea won’t get off the ground. We’ll beat the heck out of it.So trust me when I say we’re going to come together as a movement, and we’re going to continue to change America.America needs change. For decades, corporate power has grown, wages have been held down, the union share of the workforce has diminished and just about every dime in productivity gains has gone to pad the wealth of the richest one percent. The gap between the too-rich and the rest of us is as wide today as it’s ever been. But we are responding in force.Working people are tired of being knocked down. More and more are looking to unions. New data from the Pew Research Center shows a strong and rising majority of Americans support unions—60%—and our approval is even higher among workers ages 18 to 29.When I talk about working people, I’m referring to all of us who count on a paycheck to live. Every one of us shares the same basic economic interests. Whether you’re a pilot, a flight attendant or a server in the airport, we all rise and fall together.That’s one thing I spoke about during my meeting with President Trump. I told him that we would judge every action by the same yardstick, and that’s whether it helps or hurts working people. If it helps us, we’ll applaud him, and do everything in our power to push it through. If it hurts us, we’ll fight him at every turn.While the Trump Administration has done a few positive things like scrapping the TPP, they have also taken a whole host of actions that attack our solidarity, safety, health, wages, benefits, retirement security and workplace rights. We particularly object to his choice for Labor Secretary, Andy Puzder, a fast food CEO who openly disdains workers. Puzder can’t be trusted. He has routinely violated practically every rule he’d be required to enforce.Brothers and sisters, the Puzder nomination is a reminder that our pay and benefits—our rights and our unity—could get a whole lot worse during the Trump Administration. On Friday, the White House issued a statement saying the president believes in right to work. The attack on unions is raging in Washington D.C. and in states across the country. The next few years will truly define who and what we are as a labor movement.America needs to work for working people. It’s the right thing to do, and it is good economic policy. When we protect our members, when we win fair raises and good benefits, our entire economy gets a boost. Our lives get better. Our future gets brighter.We know what we want, and we know what we need. America’s unions are ready to stand up, rise up, step forward and do what’s right! And I will personally call on every worker in America to stand with you in your fights. This is about solidarity, sisters and brothers. We’re seasoned. We’re tough. And we’re big enough to win. So get off your seat and onto your feet. We’ll be marching out the door and into the street!When I speak to you about the power we can build as working people in America, I’m not asking you to disregard reality. I know it won’t be easy. I know we face long odds. But I also want each of you to consider this simple truth: Nothing is set in stone. The future is ours to shape.If there’s one thing I want you to do, it’s to keep an open mind. Listen to everybody. Watch everything with a critical eye. Stay engaged. Read what you get from your union and your central labor council. Our labor movement belongs to all of us.Whatever your personal politics, I’m asking you to embrace your union’s plan to fight for higher wages, better benefits and rights on the job. Embrace your role as an educator, too. Your members count on you for clear-eyed, dispassionate information. That’s absolutely critical. Our movement and our future is much bigger than Democrats or Republicans. It’s bigger than President Trump. It is bigger than any politician or political party. It’s about solidarity, and what we can do to build an economy that works for us, for our lives. Solidarity is the answer. Unionism provides us a path forward.Everywhere I go, I’m talking about solidarity. Real solidarity. Where your picket line is my picket line, and my picket line is your picket line. I’m talking about standing together, marching together, fighting together and winning together.This is our country. This is our time. We are the rising tide. We are the American labor movement. We won’t sit back, shut up, back down or be quiet, and we will not be denied!God bless you! Now let’s get to those questions.

296,Trumka Rallies AFGE Members to Action,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-rallies-afge-members-action,2-5-2017,"Thank you, Brother J. David [Cox] for your friendship and your leadership.  Happy Super Bowl Sunday everybody!  It’s wonderful to join you at this conference.  I’m honored to be here.I’m privileged to work with a lot of great labor leaders.  But none is more dedicated, passionate and humble than your president.  He is marching and organizing and bargaining and inspiring.  And that’s often just in a single day.  Each of you—the members of this great union—are fortunate to have a man like J. David Cox fighting alongside you.And he’ll be the first to tell you: it’s a fight worth joining.  The members of AFGE make America work. You guard our borders, run our government, manage our forests and grasslands and, really, what don’t you do?  You are scientists, doctors, nurses, social workers, technicians, administrators and everything in between.  You live in every state.  You span every so-called division.  You serve our nation with pride and lift up your families and communities in the process.Sisters and brothers, what threatens to pull us apart cannot overcome what binds us together.  Dignity. Solidarity.  Patriotism.  Service.  These values transcend partisanship.During the Obama Administration, I made it clear that the American labor movement must maintain its independence.  We are not a wing or a tool of any political party.  We stuck to it.  We praised President Obama when he moved in a good direction.  We challenged him when he didn’t.  There is no denying the facts—federal workers lost $182 billion in compensation through wage freezes and stingy pay adjustments over the last 8 years.  Now the new regime in Washington threatens to make things a whole lot worse.First, there is President Trump’s ill-conceived and unnecessary executive order freezing federal employee hiring.  In addition, some members of Congress want to do away with defined benefit pensions for federal workers, privatize the VA, eliminate dues deduction, make all new federal hires at-will and block union members from representing their coworkers during business hours.Apparently, some on the far-right want to turn the United States government into Walmart.  Well, I have a message to all those who want to freeze our jobs, cap our pay, endanger our benefits, undermine our service, micromanage our time and make our lives even harder: We are going to fight you every step of the way, and we intend to win!That’s not all.  We’re ready to go on offense.  On Tuesday last week, Gerry Connolly in the House and Brian Schatz in the Senate introduced the FAIR Act, which would help to reclaim some of the ground lost during and after the Great Recession.  You’re not asking for the world, but a 3.2 percent raise would be a good first step in the right direction.  Let’s turn that bill into law!Listen, as I speak to you about the gains we can win and the power we can build, I’m not asking you to disregard reality.  I know it won’t be easy.  I know we face long odds.  But I also want each of you to consider this simple truth: Nothing is set in stone.  The future is ours to shape.Just look at the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the massive trade deal that threatened our jobs and our economic security.  Nobody thought it could be beat.  Well, sisters and brothers—it’s now official—we defeated the TPP.  For years, we have mobilized and organized in opposition to this bad deal, winning the debate in Congress and on the campaign trail.  I want to thank the members of AFGE for your activism in writing letters, making phone calls and pushing your elected representatives to do the right thing.  I said it then, and I’ll say it now: America’s working people do not oppose all trade, but we simply will not stand for corporate-written giveaways that lower our wages and standards.We applaud President Trump for withdrawing the United States from the TPP.  Yet no elected official can be judged on any one action.  We have to look at the whole picture.  The Trump Administration is doing a whole host of things that attack our solidarity, safety, health, wages, benefits, retirement security and workplace rights.  This includes nominating a Labor Secretary who is openly hostile to workers.  In each of these instances, we are standing up against him forcefully.On the other hand, if President Trump—or any elected leader—wants to take positive action on infrastructure or trade to create jobs and lift wages, the labor movement is ready to do our part.You see, we will not make it personal.  We need jobs.  We believe each and every one of us should be able to work hard, play by the rules and earn a decent life.  In return, we want what’s fair.  That’s not too much to ask.When it comes to internal organizing, nobody does it like AFGE.  No one needs to tell you what it’s like to organize in a right to work environment.  For decades, corporate power has grown, wages have been held down, our share of the workforce has diminished and just about every dime in productivity gains has gone to the richest one percent.  The gap between the too-rich and the rest of us is as wide as it has ever been.  But working people are starting to respond.Collective action is on the rise.  We are in the midst of an overdue national conversation about how to address income inequality.  There is momentum for good jobs, fair trade and raising wages.  New research from Pew shows a strong majority of Americans support unions and our approval is even higher among workers ages 18 to 29.On the other hand, the real possibility exists that our pay and benefits—our rights and our unity—will get a whole lot worse instead of better.  The political climate is toxic, and workers are vulnerable to being pitted against one another.  The attack on unions is raging in Washington D.C. and states across the country.  The next few years will define who and what we are as a labor movement.Three years ago, hardly anybody thought the era of corporate free trade could be stopped.  They thought standing against bad trade was like spitting into the wind.  Well, guess what?  The skeptics and the naysayers were wrong.  We stopped the TPP.  We did what couldn’t be done, and we’re going to do it again.America needs to work for working people.  It’s the right thing to do, and it’s good economic policy.  When it comes to the American Dream, our union contracts are where the rubber meets the road.  Right there.  In black-and-white.  That’s where we lock down our dreams of proud service and a decent life, so we can buy a house and have a family if we want one, and look forward to a dignified retirement.We know what we want, and we are prepared to fight.  AFGE and America’s unions are ready to stand up, rise up, step forward and do what’s right!  You’ve rallied with private sector workers, and I will personally call on every worker in America to stand with you.  This is about solidarity, brothers and sisters.We’re facing the greatest threats federal workers have ever seen, but we’re geared up for battle.  We’re seasoned.  We’re tough.  And we’re big enough to win.  So get off your seat and onto your feet.  We’ll be marching out the door and into the street!We can build a better America.  I’m a third-generation coal miner from Nemacolin, Pennsylvania, and I know how unionism transformed my community, my family and my life.Whatever your personal politics, I’m asking you to embrace your union’s plan to fight for higher wages, better benefits and rights on the job.  This is bigger than President Trump.  It is bigger than any politician or political party.  It’s about solidarity, and what we can do to build an economy that works for us, for our lives.  Solidarity is the answer.  Unionism provides us a path forward.Everywhere I go, I’m talking about solidarity.  Real solidarity.  Where your issues are my issues, and my issues are yours.  I’m talking about standing together, marching together, fighting together and winning together.This is our country.  This is our time.  We are the rising tide.  We are the American labor movement.  We won’t sit back, shut up, back down or be quiet, and we will not be denied!God bless you!

297,Trumka at MLK Lunch: Racial Equality is a Labor Issue,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-mlk-lunch-racial-equality-labor-issue,1-15-2017,"Sisters and brothers, I have the special honor of presenting the At the River I Stand Award to two very deserving individuals, but before I get into that, I want to make a few points about our labor movement and the cause of justice in America.The struggle for racial equality and just immigration has always been—at its core— a labor issue. Slavery was work policy. Immigration impacts our workplaces. Housing discrimination, mass incarceration, public education, health care and nearly every front in the fight for justice touches the lives of working people.Standing up for justice—as when Dr. King traveled to Memphis to support striking sanitation workers—isn’t just morally good, it’s sound economic policy. The same is true of equal rights for all people, regardless of how we worship, where we come from or who we are.On this MLK weekend, as we rededicate ourselves to social and economic justice, let’s remember that the hard work of organizing and coalition building often comes with little fanfare, and yet it’s critical. It’s the most important part.It was this selfless and determined focus that defined the AFL-CIO Race Commission. The commission held meetings in six cities and our Civil Rights and Campaigns departments had conversations with more than 15,000 union members about how racism, sexism and all of the isms have been used to divide and weaken working people. The lessons of the commission are now even more timely and important in the wake of Donald Trump’s election—a victory fueled by division. This much is clear. We must come together—stick together—and fight back.The AFL-CIO Race Commission has done terrifically important work, and sparked overdue urgency around the need to make progress in our movement and our communities. This entire process has reminded me of one important truth: There is more that unites us than divides us.I’ve been lifted up and carried along by our work on racial justice. The AFL-CIO is better for it. Our movement is better for it. And we are just getting started.Today, I’m honored to recognize two champions in the fight for justice who have done incredible work moving us forward. I’m talking about the outstanding co-chairs of the AFL-CIO Race Commission. Over the past year, we have seen their genuine dedication. None of us has all the answers, but these leaders know how to ask the right questions, and they’ve both helped make our labor movement a more just and diverse place.Marc Perrone is a man of conviction and courage. He is committed to building a UFCW and a labor movement that is built to last. He has taken bold, brave steps as UFCW president, the kind of action we all must embrace to make our movement and our nation stronger. Marc has appointed strong women of color to the highest levels of his union. He took out a full page ad in the New York Timesto decry police brutality and call for racial reconciliation. He has been a tireless advocate for immigration reform and a forceful critic of the workplace raids that disproportionately impact UFCW members and all immigrants. Most recently, Marc was the driving force behind a high level White House meeting focused on the labor movement’s role in racial and economic justice. Sisters and brothers, please join me in welcoming UFCW President Marc Perrone.I can think of no one more deserving of this award than Marc. The same can be said for Fred Redmond. When we talk about the great African American labor leaders—A. Phillip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, Addie Wyatt, Willie and Arlene Holt Baker, Bill Lucy—I believe Fred Redmond is a part of this distinguished class. He is humble and firm, accessible and shrewd. As Executive Vice President of the Steelworkers, Fred has earned the respect of his members and the entire labor movement. He is dedicated to improving the lives of all working people, whether it’s through civil rights or collective bargaining. Sisters and brothers, please join me in welcoming USW Executive Vice President Fred Redmond.

298,Trumka at Catholic University: Labor Will Stand United and Strong in Defense of Immigrants,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-catholic-university-labor-will-stand-united-and-strong-defense-immigrants,1-10-2017,"Thank you for those kind words of introduction. I am honored to be taking part in Catholic University’s third Erroneous Autonomy Conference. This has been an invaluable experience growing and developing the transformational dialogue between America’s labor movement and the Catholic Church. I want to thank the leaders who have helped make this partnership possible: Cardinal Sean O’Malley, Bishop Robert McElroy, Dr. Steve Schneck of the Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies, and of course the labor movement’s great friend Michael Sean Winters. Michael Sean, the entire AFL-CIO wishes you Godspeed in your new role at Boston College.Three years ago, Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez of Honduras spoke before us here in Washington about the need for the United States and all nations to set aside the single-minded pursuit of wealth. He repeated Pope Francis’ warning about an economy that kills. He cited global inequality that has left working families so far behind that they often don’t have safe places to sleep, enough food to eat or access to clean water.These concerns threaten us right here in America, right now. It’s the paradox of scarcity, and its solution is both increasingly difficult and increasingly important to embrace. When you hunger, you must practice generosity. When you feel insecure, the answer is solidarity. When you’re frightened, you must trust in the abundant gift of God’s love.Erroneous autonomy claims that our only responsibility is to ourselves. It focuses on our differences rather than our shared humanity. And it fails to recognize that we are all bound together—and we will all ultimately rise or fall as one. Now I know from my faith and my work that solidarity is very, very powerful. This is a time for togetherness and unity, not the false promises of autonomy and rugged individualism.Allow me to share with you one of my personal journeys of the last year. In August, my grandson was born, and, not long after his birth, I held him in my hands and I kissed his head.Every time I see my grandson, I’m reminded that each of us is a child of God. But I can’t ignore that my grandson entered the world at one of the most polarizing times in our nation’s history— a time when division is fostered and inflamed. Now many of the people who live and work in this great country are frightened. They’re scared. And I share their concern.You see, Donald Trump campaigned on mass deportation, on building walls, on imposing religious litmus tests. Make no mistake about it, those proposals are a violation of our founding principles and our basic humanity. Many are concerned that raids, detentions and worse will occur immediately after the president-elect takes office.When Donald Trump places his hand on the Bible ten days from now, he will swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States. This is not just an oath, but a vow to lead our nation with tolerance, equality and justice for all. An inauguration is a moment to bring forward our best virtues—and to build the more perfect union our Constitution demands.That vow transcends partisanship. When it comes to immigration, we at the AFL-CIO took strong exception to the Obama Administration’s enforcement policies. Mr. Trump is threatening something much worse, escalating the pace and the number of deportations, sending armed agents into our neighborhoods and workplaces to arrest members of our unions and our communities.The specter of mass deportation is absolutely terrifying to men and women who live and who work here, who stand in line with us at the grocery store and whose children attend our schools. What he has proposed will tear at the very fabric of our society and our values, and we will not stand for it. We will resist it with everything that we have, everywhere that we are, every way that we can. And we refuse to be divided into “us” versus “them”.Instead of uprooting and deporting aspiring Americans—our coworkers and our neighbors—we really must embrace each other, because we’re not separate and we’re not autonomous. Instead of building walls, we must be bound together in solidarity. Only then can we truly see ourselves as children of God. These are the bedrock principles that the labor movement has always stood for.Let us never forget this truth: Each of us began our life’s journey the same way, vulnerable. Just like my grandson. Without love, we cannot live. Someone took care of us. Someone loved us. Love can’t be measured and it can’t be weighed and it can’t be bought and it can’t be sold. And yet nothing…nothing is as powerful or important as it.And like love, solidarity requires action to become real.That’s why, in the most difficult and personal political times, it’s essential for us to act according to the teachings offered by our moral leaders. I was raised in the Catholic Church, but Our Lady of Consolation in Nemacolin, Pennsylvania, was much more than a place of worship. It was the heart of our community. It was a shelter from danger. It was where my father and my grandfather went to escape from the Coal and Iron Police, who gave my grandfather a scar over his eye—a visual and vivid reminder of the wrongs that he had endured.Now, Anthony Barroso can tell you about being wronged. Last week, many of us read his story in the New York Times. Anthony was 13 in 2007 when federal agents with heavy weapons raided his home and arrested and deported his father—whose only crime was going to work. He did that for more than a decade. Now I’ve met too many families like Anthony’s family over the years. And the workplace and community raids that shook our country caused profound human tragedy that we…we…all of us…must now commit to prevent.In the weeks and months ahead, if Mr. Trump does as he has promised, millions of working people like Anthony’s father will face the same exact trauma. They’ll be afraid to go to work. They’ll be afraid to take their children to school, let alone speak up when they encounter abuse or exploitation. They’ll need information, they’ll need support and they’ll need active solidarity. And our homes, our communities, our workplaces and our unions will be vulnerable unless we all stand strong together. You see, the American labor movement will be part of the infrastructure of response and protection against mass deportation and any other efforts to criminalize working people. We know institutions like the Catholic Church will be rock solid at our side.Pope Francis has called upon the entire Catholic faith to be a true sanctuary in a deeply troubled world. Together…together…we can fight inequality. Together we will shelter and empower immigrants and native-born alike. We’ll define community through love and abundance, not scarcity and division. As America’s political climate grows more and more divided, our faith and our solidarity will deepen. You see, the words of the Holy Father matter. He offers us a guiding light. He gives me strength, which is what we all need more than ever right now.The next few years will define who and what we really are as a labor movement and as a church. Will we stand true to our moral values when it could actually cost us something? Will we speak out on behalf of our beliefs when others will condemn us or ridicule us? You see—we’ll be tested. But today let us all pledge to stand strong and united in defense and on behalf of the moral values that we know to be correct and true.Thank you for listening.

299,Trumka Addresses Next Generation of Global Labor Leaders,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-addresses-next-generation-global-labor-leaders,12-14-2016,"Brothers and sisters, welcome.  It’s wonderful to have you here.  Thank you for taking part in this international forum for the next generation of trade union leaders.Before you kick off your important work here, I want to talk about something that’s on everybody’s mind: Donald Trump and the emerging global movement of hatred and division.First, we will not move forward in fear.  We will continue to live and act with a solidarity that transcends boundaries, no matter what we look like, where we come from, how we worship, who we love, what language we speak or anything else.  When it comes to standing together for a better life, we will not retreat one single inch.Second, the disturbing rise of the right is what happens when inequality rises and insecurity plagues the hearts and erodes the hopes of too many people.  We see it happening in America, Europe and throughout the world.There’s nothing preordained about where we go from here.  In fact, while the danger of this moment is undeniable, it is also filled with tremendous opportunity.It’s more important than ever to build our global labor movement because we face a dual threat: one from destructive neoliberal policies and politicians; and the other from right-wing populism that brought about Brexit, Donald Trump and other threats to our prosperity and security.Your work developing a new, global “Economic and Political Agenda for Young Workers” comes at a critical time, and will shape the direction of our movement and young worker campaigns internationally.For too long, I’ve heard leaders talk about the decline of America’s labor movement as if it’s a force of nature.  It’s not.  Corporate special interests and their allies in government have been coming after us for decades.  We must turn them back.  We have no excuses.  We will rise to the demands before us.  We’ll act with urgency to combat bigotry and hatred, and our weapon will be solidarity, the same solidarity that has won raising wages and better lives in America and across the world.Our agenda remains the same.  That’s something I take to heart every single day.  How can we move the needle for working people?  How can we raise wages and make our families more secure?  Our opposition is clear—and so is our mission.At the AFL-CIO we know that organizing and empowering young people is key to growing and strengthening our movement.  We are working hard to foster the environment for young workers to organize and mobilize, to demonstrate with courage our values and our vision of shared prosperity, of true solidarity and mutual respect.  Global solidarity is the best antidote to false populism and xenophobia.The American labor movement stands with each and every one of you.Have a wonderful conference.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

300,Trumka Presents Maina Kiai with Meany-Kirkland Human Rights Award,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-presents-maina-kiai-meany-kirkland-human-rights-award,12-14-2016,"Brothers and sisters, welcome and thank you for being here. Congressman-elect Raskin, thank you for your remarks. Congratulations on your victory. We look forward to having a close working relationship in the years ahead. And thank you to the many leaders of our own movement I see here as well as partner organizations.If you’re anything like me, you might be seeing this annual award, and perhaps the entire world in a different light since Donald Trump’s election.Human rights. The ideals that sparked the formation of the United Nations. Even truth itself. All of these are under siege.If truth be told, the dangers we see here in the United States and abroad have been growing for years, for decades, because the suppression of basic human rights and the growth of income inequality create fertile ground for the resurgence of authoritarianism and the breakdown of civil society.This trend is the main reason the United Nations Special Rapporteur created the Freedom of Assembly and Association mandate in 2011, and I could not be more pleased with the powerful work of its first mandate holder, Maina Kiai.You see, our global labor movement relies on the ability of people to freely associate and assemble, and our labor unions are an important part of civil societies everywhere. We refuse to allow authoritarianism to rise unchecked. We are committed to following the inspirational path of Mr. Kiai, who has been an effective watchdog against crackdowns on freedom of association and assembly in repressive environments like Russia, Zimbabwe and Egypt. And this is equally important: He has put a spotlight on human rights and freedoms in the United States, the United Kingdom and South Korea.Mr. Kia inspires the advocates and workers who struggle to defend, maintain and grow the institutions of civil society around the world. I’m talking about those who organize for women’s rights and workers’ rights, for indigenous people, immigrants, religious freedom and economic justice.Here’s something I love about Mr. Kiai. He speaks with the same passion and force with workers as he does to the United Nations General Assembly. He speaks with dignity. He stands up to power. In fact, his integrity and ability to communicate have earned him the respect of both the world’s largest and most influential human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, and the smallest and scrappiest grassroots organizations.Mr. Kiai goes after glaring contradictions, which you can see in his recent report to the UN General Assembly. Allow me to give you an example. Almost anywhere, you can incorporate a business in no time at all—as little as one day—and government officials will bend over backwards for investors. Yet it often takes weeks and months to register a non-governmental aid organization, and officials will crack down on them in a heartbeat. Mr. Kiai has laid out these facts in a clear and compelling manner.Mr. Kiai isn’t only concerned with developing countries. He witnessed serious violations of the right to freely assemble here in the United States, and we have heard from Daniel and Lee about violations in their own communities and workplaces. Mr. Kiai’s upcoming report focused on the United States highlights migrant workers, those trying to form unions and the targeting of legitimate protesters like Black Lives Matter.The violators don’t even pretend to honor cornerstone freedoms. The government of Mississippi touts its lack of unionization when courting investors. Georgia openly sent police to harass and ticket union organizers for distributing leaflets outside a company’s gates. These aren’t exceptions but absolutely commonplace violations.We live in an era when the truth is becoming elusive. That’s why we must read Mr. Kiai’s report. It’s full of documentation. It’s full of real people, real voices, real truth.For this reason, in the best tradition of American unionism, I am proud to give to you the 2016 recipient of the George Meany-Lane Kirkland Human Rights Award, Maina Kiai.We must, we will, meet the challenge of our times. Everything we love and everything we stand for will be put to the test.On behalf of the AFL-CIO and the Solidarity Center, thank you for your ongoing advocacy for working people around the globe.Thank you, and God bless you all.

301,Trumka Makes 2016 Election Closing Argument,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-makes-2016-election-closing-argument,11-4-2016,"I’m Rich Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO.  It is great to be back in my home state of Pennsylvania.  Pittsburgh is a proud union town!Thank you, President Gerard, for hosting us.  The United Steelworkers is one of the greatest labor unions in the entire world.We’ve got four days left.  Mark my words—labor is going to be the difference in this election. And it all starts here in Pennsylvania.I know how hard you’ve been working.  But I need you to dig just a little deeper and push just a little harder.We are on the brink of something truly special.  It’s right there in front of us.For decades, the economic rules have been written by and for the wealthy.  But we are changing that.  With each phone call.  With each door knock.  With each conversation.Our agenda and our message have been the winners in this election.  But none of that matters unless we vote.We’ve won the debate.  Now it’s time to win the White House.  And the Senate.  And the Supreme Court.The stakes are high and the choice is clear.On one hand, we have Donald Trump.He is unfit to be president.  He would tear America apart.He says he wants to build great things—but he buys his steel from China.He says he’d be good for workers—but he thinks our wages are too high.He says he’s our friend—but he won’t pay us or negotiate with us or tell us the truth.Donald Trump is a fraud.And in four days, we’re going to send him a message loud and clear—not now!  Not ever!Working people need a champion.And Hillary Clinton is the woman for the job.She will make the biggest investment in infrastructure since World War II.  And she’ll do it using AMERICAN steel.She opposes the job-killing TPP today, tomorrow, and every day.She understands that to truly make America great again, we need to get America organized again.  Organized into unions!Hillary Clinton listens to our voices.  She shares our values.  She has our backs.In four days, we can either elect a public servant or a public spectacle.A respected champion or a cowardly con man.A workhorse or a jackass.Sisters and brothers, we know what to do.  Let’s elect Hillary Clinton the next president of the United States.And let’s send her there with reinforcements like Katie McGinty.  Katie is fighting for a new direction on trade.  She supports equal pay for equal work.  She wants to protect Social Security and Medicare and strengthen worker rights.And what about Pat Toomey?  He can’t even decide whether or not to vote for Donald Trump.  I mean, seriously.If you want to know who broke the economic rules, just Google Pat Toomey’s resume.  He never met a trade agreement he didn’t like until he was down in the polls.  He said right to work would make Pennsylvania more competitive.  He voted to make it harder to unionize.Enough!  If we are going to truly change the rules, we need to change the Senate.  And that means sending Katie McGinty to Washington and Pat Toomey to Zionsville.Listen, we cannot take anything for granted.  The polls are close.  Too close for comfort.  Let’s make these last four days the best of this campaign.Hit the worksites.  Talk to members.  Walk the streets and knock the doors.  And after the ballots are counted and the results are in, we’ll be in a better position to improve our communities, to organize in the workplace and to win strong contracts and better pay.We’ll fix what’s broken in America.  Together, we’ll create a better tomorrow.  We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  Each of us.  With solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.  All of us together.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm in arm.  All day.  Every day.  Voting.  Fighting.  Winning.  Together.  To bring out the best in each other and ourselves.  To bring out the best in America.  To build the nation we can have and must have and will have!Thank you!  God bless you!

302,Trumka to Metal Trades: Inequality is Not Inevitable,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-metal-trades-inequality-not-inevitable,10-6-2016,"Good morning, sisters and brothers.  Thank you, Brother Jimmy (Hart) for that introduction.  I appreciate your friendship and your leadership.  It is great to be here in Las Vegas.The Metal Trades has a proud history.  Since you were first chartered in 1908, you have been lifting workers up.  You are a champion of good, high-paying jobs with great benefits and safe workplaces.  You help bring the American Dream to families and communities across the nation.  From shipyards to power plants, you are proof of what’s possible when working people stand together for a better life.Today, that better life is under attack.  The corporate right-wing wants to ship our jobs overseas.  They want to lower our wages.  They want to take away our health care and pensions.  They want to deny us a voice on the job, destroy our unions and keep all the profits we helped create.For too long, this type of greed has been encouraged in America.  Through bad trade deals and trickle down tax policies.  Through outsourcing and other corporate schemes.  Through free market fanaticism that rewards wealth over work.  That’s why we had a Great Recession where Main Street was forced to bailout Wall Street.  That’s why wages are flat even though worker productivity is through the roof.  That’s why we are falling behind the rest of the world on education, infrastructure and innovation.It doesn’t have to be this way.  Inequality is not inevitable.  It is a choice.  The economy is nothing more than a set of rules written by the men and women we elect.  Those rules determine winners and losers.  For the last several decades, working people have been on the wrong end of that equation.  You know it and I know it.It is time for a new set of rules.  We want rules that ensure wages are high and rising, and inequality is shrinking.  We want rules that make it easier to organize and bargain collectively.  We want stronger rules on Wall Street and fairer rules for the working poor, immigrants, women and people of color.Give us these rules, and we’ll give you a new era of shared prosperity where all working people can get ahead.There’s a new, brighter day in front of us.  A union resurgence.  All we have to do is reach out and grab it.Our labor movement built the American middle class once, and we’ll do it again.  We know unity.  We practice solidarity.  When we stand together, we cannot be turned aside.We generate the power and build the ships.  We protect America and make it go.  We serve our country with pride.  We do what it takes.  We answer the call.  We won’t be faced down or pushed around, and we will not be denied.Now listen, we’ve got an election in 33 days.  Momentum is on our side.  A new economic report shows that workers won a pay increase of over 5 percent in 2015, the first raise since 2007.  That same year, 5 million workers went to the bargaining table, the most in recent memory.  This is not a coincidence.  When we organize, when we bargain collectively, when we stand strong, wages go up, not just for union members, but workers across the board.We’re having that same impact in politics.  Working people are shaping the debate like never before.  We’ve put wage stagnation and inequality front and center, and that’s where we intend to keep them.  Just look at the first question in last week’s presidential debate.  It was about raising wages.  That’s our agenda!We’ve also put the brakes on the job-killing, no good Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Nearly everybody thought the TPP was a done deal.  It had the support of the president, Congressional leaders and an army of special interests.  But the Wall Street and Washington elite underestimated our strength.  And I promise you, if that bad deal comes up for a vote after the election, we’ll kill it once and for all.As a labor movement, we are putting our agenda before our politics.  We are leading with the issues.  When we stand up for working people, and not any political party, candidates will stop taking us for granted, and we can better hold our elected leaders accountable.Sisters and brothers, the choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump—it isn’t a choice at all.  Did you watch that debate last week?  I don’t even know where to start.Donald Trump is completely unfit to be president.  He crumbled under the lights of a 90-minute debate.  Can you imagine him in the Oval Office or God forbid, the Situation Room?Clinton is better in every objective measure.  Clinton is reliable.  Trump is not.  Clinton is prepared.  Trump is not.  Clinton is civil.  Trump is anything but.  Clinton has a track record of fighting for workers.  Trump has a track record of ripping workers off.If you want to know where Donald Trump really stands, ask the brave men and women at Trump Hotel here in Las Vegas.  First, Trump paid a union-busting firm hundreds of thousands of dollars to discourage workers from organizing.  The workers won anyway.  Then, Trump refused to recognize the union.  He dragged his feet.  He filed an appeal.  He did everything except bargain a first contract.  It is time for Donald Trump to get off of Twitter and come to the bargaining table.Are we really surprised that Trump is refusing to negotiate a fair deal?  Remember, he says wages are too high.  Just think about that for a second.  Maybe that’s why he has continually stiffed plumbers and painters and dishwashers.  He thinks we’ve already made too much money.  This is from a man who has never struggled, and actually brags about not paying his taxes.  Trump has never had to worry about keeping the lights on.  He doesn’t know what it’s like to have to choose between food and medicine.  He doesn’t understand the pain of telling a child you cannot afford to send them to camp, much less college.  People lost their homes, jobs and life savings because of his greed.  And he has the audacity to say wages are too high?  I say no.  We say no.  And in 33 days, all of America will say no.Now, I know there’s some skepticism about Hillary Clinton.  She’s been scrutinized and poked and prodded for the better part of 40 years.  But when you peel back the layers, you’ll find a public servant that has always looked out for working people.Hillary will make the largest investment in infrastructure, workforce development and manufacturing since World War II—to the tune of over 10 million new jobs.  She has a detailed plan to educate and train workers for careers of the future, boosting our competitiveness in the global marketplace.  And when it comes to workers’ rights, she knows the single greatest tool for economic mobility and a growing middle class is collective bargaining.Hillary Clinton is the right candidate at the right time.  Our nation is rediscovering unionism.  This is our chance.  This is our moment.  We won’t back up or back down.  We’ll stand tall.  We’ll mobilize.  We’ll organize.  We’ll register.  We’ll vote.  We’re winning the debate.  Now it’s time to win the election!The next 33 days are about where our country is going.  The contrast and the stakes are enormous.   So the labor movement has unleashed the most comprehensive and sophisticated electoral program in our history.  We need your help.  Engage your members.  Send out your release staff.  I want the union vote to reach unprecedented levels.  We recently got results back from an internal poll of union members in five key states.  The findings exposed another one of Donald Trump’s lies—the idea that he has “tremendous” support among union members.In fact, Trump’s numbers are lower than Mitt Romney’s in 2012.  We are cutting through Trump’s bluster and getting to the heart of his record.  Trump may be loud, but we are clear.  When your membership gets involved, nothing can stop us.  When working people speak the truth about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, we move the needle. It’s time for us to stand up strong, brothers and sisters.  It’s time to mobilize and organize.  This electoral season is all about raising wages.  We’ll hit the worksites.  We’ll talk to members.  We’ll walk the streets and knock the doors.  This is what a unified labor movement does.  This is what it looks like when working people stand together, union strong!And after the ballots are counted and the results are in, we’ll be in a better position to improve our communities, to organize in the workplace and to win strong contracts and raising wages.We’ll fix what’s broken in America.  Together, we will create a better tomorrow.  We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  Each of us.  With solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.  Machinists with Glass Molders.  Laborers with Operating Engineers.  Plumbers and Pipefitters.  Boilermakers and IBEW.  All of us together.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm in arm.  All day.  Every day.  Voting.  Fighting.  Winning.  To bring out the best in each other and ourselves.  To bring out the best in America.  To build the nation we can have and must have and will have!  Thank you!  God bless you!

303,Trumka to Missouri AFL-CIO Delegates: You Inspire Me,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-missouri-afl-cio-delegates-you-inspire-me,9-27-2016,"Good morning, sisters and brothers.  It is great to be back in Missouri.  Thank you, Mike (Louis), for that introduction.  I appreciate your friendship and leadership.In my role as president of the AFL-CIO, I get to travel across the country.  I meet with union members and leaders from coast to coast.  I see our movement in action, organizing new workplaces, bargaining industry leading contracts and taking on the big political fights.  It inspires me.Of all the places I have gone and all the solidarity I have seen, none is more impressive than what you are doing here in Missouri.  I mean it.You’ve shown guts.  You’ve shown courage.  You’ve shown determination.  You’ve shown us how to beat the odds and the wealthy special interests.  You’ve shown us how to build a bipartisan coalition of pro-worker legislators who are willing to risk their jobs to protect ours—so we can build a stronger economy.The corporate right-wing has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at us here in Missouri. Actually, no, they threw the sink, too.  We’ve been fighting right to work since it was first on the ballot in 1978.  38 years.We beat it then and we’re going to keep beating it until our legislators finally get the message that we don’t want the government interfering with our workplace rights.  As you all know, the corporate right-is relentless.  Missouri has been ground zero for anti-worker attacks.  Paycheck deception.  Prevailing wage.  Teacher tenure.  You name it.Sisters and brothers, you have beaten back every single attack, despite the fact that anti-worker politicians control the Missouri House and Senate.  You’ve done it by making labor a force in Jefferson City.  If you travel to the Capitol when the state legislature is in session, you’ll see union members from wall to wall.  You’ve formed relationships with elected leaders on both sides of the aisle.  You’ve testified at hearings, shared your stories and put a human face on the struggle for workers’ rights.  More than anything, you’ve placed your agenda before your politics, not the other way around.As a labor movement, when we lead with our agenda, when we prove that we work for working people, and not any political party, then—and only then—candidates stop taking us for granted. When our support is based on issues, we can better hold our elected leaders accountable.Back in Washington, people might wonder why Missouri unions are supporting a Republican. Here, the answer is self-evident.  We don’t work for Ds and Rs.  We support candidates who support us.What you have done here in Missouri is part of a national movement.  A new economic report shows that workers got a pay increase of over 5 percent in 2015, the first raise since 2007.  2015 also happens to be the year that 5 million workers went to the bargaining table, the most in recent memory.  This is not a coincidence.  When we organize, when we bargain collectively, when we stand strong, wages go up, not just for union members, but workers across the board.We’re having that same impact in politics.  Working people are shaping the debate like never before.  We’ve made rewriting the economic rules the central issue of the 2016 campaign.  We’ve put wage stagnation and inequality front and center, and that’s where we intend to keep them.  And thanks to you, we put the brakes on the job-killing, no good Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Nearly everybody thought the TPP was a done deal.  It had the support of the president, Congressional leaders and an army of special interests.  But the Wall Street and Washington elite underestimated our strength.  Working people stood up and said: Enough. Enough doing the same thing over and over again and hoping it doesn’t hurt workers.In the labor movement, we don’t hope and wish.  We mobilize and organize.  So we’re stopping the TPP.  And I promise you, if that bad deal comes up for a vote after the election, we’ll kill it once and for all.Sisters and brothers, there’s a new, brighter day in front of us.  A union resurgence.  But we must reach out and grab it.  Our labor movement built the American middle class once, and we’ll do it again.  We know unity.  We practice solidarity.  When we stand together, we cannot be turned aside.We generate the power and run the plants.  We teach the classes and carry the loads.  We patrol the roads, stock the shelves, build the trucks and ride the rails.  We do it all.  We answer the call. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night.  We don’t mind hard work.  We do it with pride.  We won’t be faced down or pushed around, and we will not be denied.Now listen, we’ve got an election six weeks from today.  The stakes are enormous.  The bipartisan, pro-worker firewall we have built here in Missouri would not be possible without a champion in the Governor’s Mansion.  For 8 years, Jay Nixon has been that champion.  The only path forward is to elect someone who will follow in his footsteps.  Sisters and brothers, we have to make Chris Koster the next governor of Missouri.I am not exaggerating when I say this is the most important gubernatorial race in the country.  As Attorney General, Chris has fought with us and for us.  He strongly opposes right to work.  He will invest in education and job training.  And he will always give unions a seat at the table.His opponent won the Republican primary promising to sign right to work.  To me, that’s the end of the conversation.  I don’t care if he can shoot a gun.  I don’t care if he used to be a Democrat. I care that he wants to take away our rights on the job.  As I said earlier, agenda before politics.Sisters and brothers, if we lose this race, Missouri will become a right to work state.  It’s that simple.  But guess what?  We’re not going to lose.  We’re going to do what the Missouri labor movement always does.  We’re going to stand up and fight and win!We’re going to fight back against Amendment 6.  Injustice comes in many forms.  This year, it will be printed right there on your ballot.  Extremists in the legislature are pushing a Constitutional amendment that says that if you don’t have the right kind of ID—and nearly 220,000 people in Missouri don’t—you should be turned away from your polling place.I wish I could tell you the people behind voter ID laws are just misinformed—that they simply don’t realize that voter fraud is virtually nonexistent and this unnecessary measure would cost taxpayers $17 million that could be better spent on jobs and schools.  But we know better. Voter ID laws are about one thing: making it harder for certain Missourians to vote.  African-Americans.  Students.  Seniors.  People with disabilities.  They want to make working people jump higher and through more hoops just to exercise their fundamental right.Why?  Because they know when we vote, we win.  When we join together, we grow our middle class and create shared prosperity.  So, you tell me: Are we going to let these politicians chip away at our right to vote?  The answer, of course, is no.  On this, National Voter Registration Day, let’s pledge to Vote No on 6! On the national level, Roy Blunt is running for his 185th term in Congress.  Okay, it hasn’t been that long, but talk about an insider’s insider.  Blunt is part of the dysfunctional Senate majority that refuses to perform basic duties like voting on President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. And Roy Blunt has never missed a chance to stick it to the labor movement.While Blunt was serving special interests in Washington, Jason Kander was serving our country in uniform.  He is pro-worker, pro-union and pro-veteran.  He has forcefully protected our right to vote as Missouri’s Secretary of State.  I’ve met Jason.  He is exactly the kind of fresh face and voice we need in the U.S. Senate.Then, of course, we have the presidential election.  Polls in Missouri are close.  And the choice between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton—isn’t.Donald Trump is unfit to be president.  He is anti-worker.  He would tear America apart.  Hillary Clinton is better in every objective measure.  Clinton is reliable.  Trump is not.  Clinton is responsible.  Trump is not.  Clinton is civil.  Trump is anything but.  Clinton has a track record of fighting for workers.  Trump has a track record of ripping workers off.Seriously, folks, listen to Trump’s record for just a minute.  He thinks our wages are too high, and he has stolen our pay time and time again.  Literally stolen it.  He said outsourcing creates jobs.  He supports right to work 100 percent.  He rooted for the financial crisis and is closely tied to a new effort to gut Wall Street reform.A business group analyzed Trump’s economic plans and concluded he would cost America 3.4 million jobs.  Trump is asking us to vote for him and accept more unemployment—why would we do that?And what about his tax returns?  Why is he refusing to release them?  Does anyone else find this fishy?  Does Trump have money stashed overseas?  Has he failed to pay his fair share?  Is he somehow invested in Russia?  He certainly talks about Vladimir Putin enough. Hillary Clinton is without question the better choice.  Now, I know there’s some skepticism about her.  She’s been scrutinized and poked and prodded for the better part of 40 years.  But when you peel back the layers, you’ll find a public servant that has always looked out for working people.The same business group that gave Trump’s plan an F-minus gave Hillary Clinton an A+.  They say she would create 10.4 million jobs, and her website tells us exactly how she’ll get it done.Hillary Clinton wants the largest investment in infrastructure since World War II, which will create millions of jobs and strengthen our economy across the supply chain.  She has a detailed plan to educate and train workers for careers of the future, boosting our competitiveness in the global marketplace.  And when it comes to workers’ rights, she knows the single greatest tool for economic mobility and a growing middle class is collective bargaining.Hillary Clinton is the right candidate at the right time.  Our nation is rediscovering unionism. This is our chance.  This is our moment.  To bring out the best in America.  To bring out the best in ourselves, and each other.  We won’t back up or back down.  We’ll stand tall.  We’ll mobilize. We’ll organize.  We’ll register.  We’ll vote.  We’re winning the debate.  Now it’s time to win the election!When I spoke at your convention two years ago in St. Louis, it was shortly after Michael Brown’s death.  What happened in Ferguson that summer sparked a national firestorm, one we are still living through today.  Recent events in Charlotte, Tulsa, Dallas, Baton Rouge and St. Paul have shaken us to the core, threatening to further divide our communities.I’ll repeat now what I said then: we must clearly and openly discuss the reality of racism in American life.  To your credit, you have embraced this challenge head on.  You hosted an AFL-CIO Race Commission hearing in St. Louis where people of all colors came together to have an honest conversation, listen to each other and identify solutions.  You are creating ladders of opportunity through your Building Union Diversity program.  BUD has been recognized by Vice President Biden and other top leaders.  These are great first steps.  I want to challenge you to do more.  Take bold action to truly broaden the labor movement.  Fill every one of those BUD slots. Continue to make it clear there can be no economic justice without racial justice.  Let communities of color know the labor movement is their movement.Mike, I also want to recognize your great work emphasizing industrial manufacturing.  You’ve reached out to Wisconsin AFL-CIO President Phil Neuenfeldt to learn more about their training program.  You are working to increase and improve registered apprenticeship opportunities for women, veterans, people of color, young workers, ex-offenders and individuals with disabilities. This is not only the right thing to do, it will help you organize, grow your membership and become more diverse.Sisters and brothers, there is more that unites us than divides us.  We can all agree that being a police officer is a noble profession that deserves good wages, great benefits and respect on the job.  We can all agree that officers who abuse their badge should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.  We can all agree that every worker—regardless of how they look, where they come from, or who they are—deserves the opportunity to build a better life. In these difficult times, we must resist the urge to become divided.  Here in Missouri, you know this better than anyone—united we stand, divided we fall.  For centuries, employers have tried to divide us for their own benefit.  They know that if we fight each other we won’t be strong enough to win a fair share of the wealth we help create.  Racism, sexism, all of the other isms—they are about holding us down and keeping us poor.  We simply cannot allow it to happen.So in the end, this is more than just an election.  It's about where our country is going.  It's about what kind of nation we're going to be, an America that says you are mine and I am yours, or one that governs by dividing and fanning fears.By standing together, and defining American values for the ages, we’ll defeat the misguided, petty and unnecessary politics of division and disunity.To make that happen, the labor movement has unleashed the most comprehensive and sophisticated electoral program in our history.  We need your help.  Talk to your members.  Send out your release staff.  I want the union vote to reach unprecedented levels.  If you haven’t done it already, talk to your central labor council.  Name a coordinator for each worksite, so our team has someone to communicate with.  There is a canvass this afternoon.  Let’s knock some doors and win some votes.The corporate right-wing is pumping millions of dollars into Missouri.  But this race is going to be won on the ground.  When your membership gets involved, nothing can stop us.  When you get behind Chris Koster and Jason Kander, the sky is the limit.  When working people speak the truth about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, we will move the needle.  When you get out to vote, you can protect that right for every single Missourian.It’s time for us to stand up strong, brothers and sisters.  It’s time to mobilize and organize.  This electoral season is all about raising wages.  We’ll hit the worksites.  We’ll talk to members. We’ll walk the streets and knock the doors.  This is what a unified labor movement does.  This is what it looks like when working people stand together, union strong!And after the ballots are counted and the results are in, we’ll be in a better position to improve our communities, to organize in the workplace and to win strong contracts and better pay.We’ll fix what’s broken in America.  Together, we will create a better tomorrow.  We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  Each of us.  With solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.  Pipefitters with UFCW.  Steel with Nurses.  Painters and Electricians.  All of us together.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm in arm.  All day.  Every day.  Voting.  Fighting.  Winning.  Together.  To bring out the best in each other and ourselves.  To bring out the best in America.  To build the nation we can have and must have and will have! Thank you!  God bless you! © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
304,Trumka to IBEW Delegates: Nothing Can Stop Us When We Stand Together,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-ibew-delegates-nothing-can-stop-us-when-we-stand-together,9-21-2016,"Thank you, Lonnie [Stephenson], for that introduction. Good morning, IBEW! What a crowd. Lonnie, I want to commend you for your outstanding leadership of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. You’re doing the labor movement proud. You’re doing Ed Hill proud. You’re doing your members proud. The IBEW is strong!As I start, I also want to thank you for Liz Shuler. Liz has done an incredible job at the AFL-CIO—conserving our resources, inspiring a new generation of activists and making sure we use technology to create shared prosperity. She has brought passion and dedication to the job and given the labor movement a face and voice of the future. I am thankful every day that our Secretary-Treasurer came out of the IBEW.Congratulations on your 125th anniversary. For well over a century, the IBEW has been a model of professionalism. You don’t just strive for quality. You demand it. Your code of excellence is an ironclad promise—that every job crafted with IBEW hands will be done with the highest of standards. You’ve brought that same commitment to the important work of organizing, bargaining and representation.The IBEW has always understood that workers have a responsibility to help our employers succeed. But we also have a right to share in that success—to grab a fair piece of the profits we help create. That’s the flip side of the shared sacrifice we face in the hard times. Again and again, we’ve done our share of sacrificing. We want prosperity in the good times.Looking back, I remember how your industries were hit hard by the Great Recession. But with grit and determination, you bounced back. Overall membership has ticked up. In city after city, construction is humming again. In manufacturing and energy, government and railroad, you are bringing the union advantage to communities across North America.A new economic report shows that workers got a pay increase of over 5 percent in 2015, the first raise since 2007. 2015 also happens to be the year that 5 million workers went to the bargaining table, the most in recent memory. Brothers and sisters, this is not a coincidence. When we organize, when we bargain collectively, when we stand strong, wages go up, not just for union members, but workers across the board.We’re having that same impact in politics. Working people are shaping the debate like never before. Together, we’ve stopped the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership and set the table for a new direction on trade. We’ve put wage stagnation and inequality front and center, and that’s where we intend to keep them. The Democratic Party heard our call, adopting the strongest, most unifying and worker-centered national platform in more than a generation. That’s a big deal, because it’s a standard we can hold people to. You see, we want more than victory for our candidates on November 8. We want wins at the bargaining table. We want wins in our wallets.This is what unions do. We’re carrying on the proud tradition of a visionary named Henry Miller, who founded the IBEW at a boardinghouse not far from this convention hall.Henry Miller was a lineman in the age of electrical streetcars and trams. He traveled this country to spread the word about how unionism could raise wages and make work safer. He knew the dangers of his job—ultimately losing his own life in a work-related accident. His message still rings true today.Nothing can stop us when we stand together. We make our economy go. We keep our communities strong. We build great things. We harness power, and make it safe. We do what it takes. We answer the call. We don’t mind hard work. We do it with pride. We are the labor movement, and we will not be denied!Now listen, I could not come here today without talking about the election. In 48 days, America will make a momentous decision. Will we build on our progress and continue to move America forward? Or will we sit back and let fear and division win the day? Will we elect a powerful woman who understands that America is strong when unions are strong? Or will we promote a man who has spent his life ripping us off?One of the reasons we’ve been able to make so much progress this year is our political independence. When we put our agenda first, when we make it clear that we work for working people, and not any political party, candidates have to prove themselves on our issues. I don’t care if you’re a Democrat, Republican or something in between—if you stand with us, we’ll stand with you. And if you try to deny us the freedom to stand together for a better life, we will vote you out of office. Remember, agenda-driven politics also puts us in a much stronger position to hold our elected leaders accountable. Your party affiliation should not give you cover for a lousy voting record.I apply these same vigorous standards to every single election. I look at every campaign and every candidate with fresh eyes. I focus on exactly how our members and all working people would be affected. This isn’t just important, it’s my mandate. It’s my job.Brothers and sisters, the choice between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton—it isn’t a choice. Clinton is better in every objective measure. Clinton is reliable. Trump is not. Clinton is responsible. Trump is not. Clinton is civil. Trump is anything but.A business group analyzed Trump’s economic proposals and concluded he would cost America 3.4 million jobs. A Trump presidency would cripple our manufacturing base and put construction workers back in the unemployment line. The same firm that gave Trump an F-minus said Hillary Clinton’s plan to invest in infrastructure and workforce development would create 10.4 million new jobs. Trump made a reality TV show called “The Apprentice.” Clinton would make real-life apprenticeship programs a national priority.Here’s all you need to know about Donald Trump. He thinks our wages are too high, and he has stolen our pay time and time again. He said outsourcing creates jobs. He rooted for the housing collapse. He supports right to work 100%. And look at his choice of running mate—Mike Pence—who repealed Indiana’s 80-year old prevailing wage law. That was a direct attack on the IBEW.Compare that to Hillary Clinton who worked with IBEW Local 97 in upstate New York to save the wages and benefits of utility workers at National Grid. Hillary doesn’t just talk. She delivers. She is tough. She is smart. She is prepared. And she knows that the single greatest tool for economic mobility and a growing middle class is collective bargaining.Hillary Clinton is the right candidate at the right time. Our nation is rediscovering unionism. This is our chance. This is our moment. To bring out the best in America. To bring out the best in ourselves, and each other. We won’t back up or back down. We’ll stand tall. We’ll mobilize. We’ll organize. We’ll register. We’ll vote. We’re winning the debate. Now it’s time to win the election!Brothers and sisters, our economy isn’t like the weather. It doesn’t simply happen to us. It’s a set of rules written by the men and women we elect.It is time for a new set of rules. We want rules where wages are high and rising, and inequality is shrinking. We want rules that make it easier to organize and bargain collectively. We want trade rules that create jobs and shared prosperity. We want stricter rules on Wall Street and fairer rules for people who work hard yet still struggle to get by.There’s a new, brighter day in front of us. A union resurgence. It’s so close. All we have to do is reach out and grab it.In the end, this is more than just an election. It's about where our country is going. It's about what kind of nation we're going to be, an America that says you are mine and I am yours, or one that governs by dividing and fanning fears.By standing together, and defining American values for the ages, we’ll defeat the misguided, petty and unnecessary politics of division and disunity.To make that happen, the labor movement has unleashed the most comprehensive and sophisticated electoral program in our history. We need your help. Talk to your members. Send out your release staff. I want the union vote to reach unprecedented levels. If you haven’t done it already, talk to your central labor council. Name a coordinator for each worksite, so our team has someone to communicate with.When your membership gets involved in the ground campaign, nothing can stop us. When working people speak the truth about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, we move the needle. You know what it takes. Keep leading the way. Keep blazing a trail forward.It’s time for us to stand up strong, brothers and sisters. This electoral season is all about raising wages. We’ll hit the worksites. We’ll walk the streets and knock the doors. And after the ballots are counted and the elections have been won, we’ll be in a better position to organize in the workplace, and win strong contracts and better pay.We’ll fix what’s broken in our country. Each of us. With solidarity. Where your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line. Shoulder to shoulder. Arm in arm. Together. All day. Every day. We’ll honor the legacy of our founders. We’ll build on what was started here 125 years ago. Union proud! Union strong! Let’s get to work. Thank you, IBEW! God bless you!

305,Trumka to Ohio AFL-CIO Delegates: This is Our Moment,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-ohio-afl-cio-delegates-our-moment,9-20-2016,"Thank you, Tim [Burga] for your warm words of introduction.  It’s great to be back in Cleveland.Listen, I’ve got plenty of notes in front of me about the elections this year, but before I get into that, I want to talk about the state of our movement.The public profile of unions in America is improving, according to Gallup, a strong majority of Americans support the labor movement.  A growing number of people—especially young workers—want us to have a greater influence in our economy and our politics.These trends are important, but none of us can take them for granted.  Our popularity is growing because of our values and our effectiveness.  Americans are also giving unions a new look because we put our agenda before our politics and not the other way around.We’ve made rewriting the economic rules the central issue of this campaign.  We’ve built new alliances and strengthened old ones.  We’ve won raises for minimum wage workers and bargained pay increases for millions of union members.And thanks to you, we put the brakes on the job-killing, no good Trans-Pacific Partnership. Nearly everybody thought the TPP was a done deal.  It had the support of the president, Congressional leaders and an army of special interests.  But the Wall Street and Washington elite underestimated our strength.  Working people stood up and said: Enough.  Enough shuttered factories and devastated towns.  Enough corporate giveaways and empty promises.  Enough of doing the same thing over and over again and wishing for a different result.In the labor movement, we don’t hope and wish.  We mobilize and organize.  So we’re stopping the TPP.  And I promise you, if that bad deal comes up for a vote after the election, we’ll kill it once and for all.Our growing and powerful impact is evident in political races across the country, and especially in the presidential election.  Hillary Clinton is looking to us for genuine guidance on working family issues.  Even Donald Trump is stealing our language to pretend like he’s on our side.It’s clear that working people are setting the tone and direction of this campaign.  You could see it plain as day in the strongest, most progressive, pro-worker Democratic platform in a generation.When we put our agenda first, when we make it clear that we work for working people, and not any political party, candidates start to embrace our agenda instead of taking us for granted.  When our support is based on issues—not political affiliation—we are better able to hold our elected leaders accountable.Sisters and brothers, here is what I tell the candidates I talk to: our economy isn’t like the weather.  It doesn’t simply happen to us.  It’s a set of rules shaped by the people we elect.It is time for a new set of rules.  We want rules where wages are high and rising, and inequality is shrinking.  We want rules that make it easier to organize and bargain collectively.  We want stronger rules on Wall Street and fairer rules for the working poor, immigrants, women and people of color.  We want trade rules that create jobs and shared prosperity.Give us fair rules, and we’ll give you a new era of shared prosperity where all working people can get ahead.In the next six weeks, we have the power to determine the future of these rules.There’s a new, brighter day in front of us.  A union resurgence.  It’s so close I can feel it.  All we have to do is reach out and grab it.Our labor movement built the American middle class once, and we’ll do it again.  We know unity.  We practice solidarity.  When we stand together, we cannot be turned aside.We generate the power and run the plants.  We teach the classes and carry the loads.  We patrol the roads, stock the shelves, build the trucks and ride the rails.  We do it all.  We do what it takes.  We answer the call.  We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night.  We don’t mind hard work.  We do it with pride.  We won’t be faced down or pushed around, and we will not be denied.Listen, I meant what I said about our independence in politics.  Our support is not unconditional, and it is not unlimited.  We look at every campaign and every candidate with fresh eyes.  I focus on exactly how our families would be affected.  This isn’t just important, it’s my mandate.  It’s my job.The choice between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton—it isn’t a choice.Donald Trump is unfit to be president.  He is anti-worker.  He would tear America apart.  Hillary Clinton is better in every objective measure.  Clinton is reliable.  Trump is not.  Clinton is responsible.  Trump is not.  Clinton is civil.  Trump is anything but.  Clinton has a track record of fighting for workers.  Trump has a track record of ripping workers off.A business group analyzed Trump’s economic plans and concluded he would cost America 3.4 million jobs.  Do we really want more unemployment—just as we are finally getting back on our feet?  We know what economic downturn looks like in Ohio.  Steel and auto would be hard hit. Local and state governments would be forced to cut services and lay off nurses, firefighters, teachers and police.  The building trades would lose work.  We simply cannot afford to go back.The same business group that gave Trump’s plan an F-minus gave Hillary Clinton an A+.  They say she would create 10.4 million jobs, and her website tells us exactly how she’ll get it done.Hillary Clinton wants massive investments in infrastructure, which will create millions of jobs and strengthen our economy across the supply chain.  She has a detailed plan to educate and train workers for careers of the future, boosting our competitiveness in the global marketplace.  She will make the largest investment in infrastructure, workforce development and manufacturing since World War II.  And when it comes to workers’ rights, she knows the single greatest tool for economic mobility and a growing middle class is collective bargaining.What about Donald Trump?  He thinks our wages are too high, and he has stolen our pay time and time again.  Literally.  He said outsourcing creates jobs.  He supports right to work 100 percent.  He rooted for the housing collapse and is closely tied to a new effort to gut Wall Street reform.And what about his tax returns?  Why is he refusing to release them?  Does anyone else find this fishy?  Does Trump have money stashed overseas?  Has he failed to pay his fair share?  Is he somehow invested in Russia?  He certainly talks about Vladimir Putin enough.  Trump’s lack of financial transparency is just the latest red flag from a candidate who is equal parts shady and shameless.Donald Trump has it all wrong: America is tilting toward unionism.  This is our chance.  This is our moment.  To bring out the best in America.  To bring out the best in ourselves, and each other.  We won’t back up or back down.  We’ll stand tall.  We’ll register. We’ll vote, and we’ll win new rules for a new economy!Brothers and sisters, a few days ago, we got results back from an internal poll of union members in five key states, including Ohio.  The findings exposed another one of Donald Trump’s lies—the idea that he has “tremendous” support among union members.In fact, Trump’s numbers are lower than Mitt Romney’s in 2012, and dropping.  This year, America’s labor movement has unleashed the most comprehensive and sophisticated electoral program in our history.  It’s working.  Since June, Trump’s support among union members has dropped five points because of the conversations each of you are having.But that’s just the beginning.  We have a lot more work to do.  There are school levies and other important local measures here in Cleveland, in Toledo and in Cincinnati that need our legwork. We need to elect state legislators that will work with us and lay the path for a working family governor in 2018.  We need to send Ted Strickland back to Washington and Rob Portman back to Wall Street.  Don’t worry about the polls.  We repealed SB 5.  We’re stopping the TPP.  Trust me, we can defeat Rob Portman.But it takes work to win.  Send your release staff.  Engage your members.  Send your apprentice teams.  Ask them to volunteer and turn out at the polls.  I want to see union members vote at unprecedented levels.  If you haven’t done it already, talk to our campaign staffers in Ohio.  I know them.  They’re hard-working true-believers, and they are here to help you.  Name a coordinator for each worksite, so our team has someone to communicate with.When your membership gets involved in the ground campaign, nothing can stop us.  When working people speak the truth about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, we will move the needle.  When you get behind Ted Strickland, the polls will change.  You know what it takes.  Keep leading the way.  Keep blazing a trail forward. It’s time for us to stand up strong, brothers and sisters.  It’s time to mobilize and organize.  This electoral season is all about raising wages.  We’ll hit the worksites.  We’ll talk to members.  We’ll walk the streets and knock the doors.  This is what a unified labor movement does.  This is what it looks like when working people stand together, union strong!And after the ballots are counted and the results are in, we’ll be in a better position to improve our communities, to organize in the workplace and to win strong contracts and better pay.We’ll fix what’s broken in America.  Together, we will create a better tomorrow.  We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.  Pipefitters with UFCW.  Steel with Autoworkers.  Painters and Electricians.  All of us together.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm in arm.  All day.  Every day.  Voting.  Fighting.  Winning.  Together.  To bring out the best in each other and ourselves.  To bring out the best in America.  To build the nation we can have and must have and will have! Thank you!  And God bless you!

306,Trumka to IAM Convention: Your Professionalism is Unparalleled ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-iam-convention-your-professionalism-unparalleled,9-6-2016,"Thank you, Brother Bob [Martinez]. I hope everyone had a great Labor Day! I’m proud to be here with the Machinists and Aerospace Workers, one of America’s largest, strongest and most powerful unions! Thank you for inviting me to your convention.I can feel the energy in this room. You are strong, united and ready to organize. Your professionalism is unparalleled. Your activism will help create a new middle class in America.You and your members literally made the Space Age possible, and we all know the incredible record of union workers in the airline industry. We see you working hard to bring the union advantage to communities near and far, whether at Ikea in southern Virginia or Airbus in Alabama.When you win those campaigns, the supply chains follow, and the good news about unionism spreads by word of mouth. Your contracts set the standards on wages, workplace safety, pensions and health care. And in return, you provide workmanship that is second to none.Unionism creates a virtuous cycle. Our entire economy improves. Consumers have more money to spend. Employers feel competitive pressure to raise wages and standards. And more workers want to experience the power of a union contract. That’s the strength of collective bargaining and collective action. By standing together, we can set off a race to the top.We raise the bar in politics, too. When we get off the sidelines and onto the front lines, we build momentum for our issues and elect candidates who share our working family values.This year, working people are leading the national conversation. We put the focus on good jobs with strong and growing wages. We’ve made it clear that workers should share in the wealth we help create. We’ve shifted the conversation on trade. Instead of continuing to get run over by corporate trade deals, we’re leading the fight to write new global rules that lift up our families and communities. We’ve been able to make headway because our agenda is driving our politics, not the other way around.This year our activism has influenced and inspired America’s leaders more than any time in the past 50 years. That’s why I believe we need to throw everything we have into politics from now until Election Day. Working people are winning the debate. Now we can win the election and change the economic rules.When you go back home after this convention, I want you to reach even higher. We need your release staff. We need your mobilization and groundwork. The leaders we elect, from the state house to the White House, will have a tremendous impact on pocketbook issues for your members. You can make the difference. Working people need it. The labor movement needs it. Your family, neighbors and community needs it.We know unity. We practice solidarity. We built the American middle class once, and we’ll do it again.We shape the steel and drive the rivets. We carry the loads and build the ships. From skyscrapers to airplanes, we make it all. We do what it takes. We don’t mind hard work. We do it with pride. We won’t be faced down or pushed around, and we will not be denied.One of the things I admire most about the Machinists and Aerospace Workers is the diversity of your membership. It’s part of your strength. You don’t do what’s easy. You do what’s right. I know you’re constantly focused on growth, whether it’s with creative long-term organizing in the South or even by strengthening your organizing department. This is what powerful unions do. We can never be complacent.As a labor movement, we are constantly evolving. We’re increasing our connections to each other and our communities. We’ve set our sights on new industries. We’re using the latest tools to communicate effectively while doubling down on the things that work.The structures of our local, area and state labor federations are here to support you. My job exists to help you do yours, and the same is true all the way down to your local CLC.I know you’ve been working hard, and that dedication is starting to pay off. We've been fighting for decades to put the rules of the economy up for debate so they can be changed. And we’ve done it. These rules are now front and center.Our economy isn’t like the weather. It’s man-made, and if it doesn’t work, we can and should fix it.Workers are making a great case for new economic rules. And because we spoke up, Democrats nominated a presidential candidate that shares our vision and our values. Hillary Clinton opposes the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, is committed to raising wages for working families and understands that when workers are strong, when unions are strong, America is strong.I’ll have more to say about Hillary Clinton shortly, but I can’t let another moment pass without addressing the disgrace that is Donald Trump.We could talk all day about Trump’s poor judgment and character, his lack of respect for our military, his racism, sexism, xenophobia and outright dishonesty. When Donald Trump insults a war hero or expresses his disdain for women or behaves like a schoolyard bully, these aren’t mistakes. That’s who Trump is.As a nation, we have always tried to hold true to the promises in the U.S. Constitution that all of us, every single one of us, is created equal. It hasn’t been easy, and progress has often been painfully slow. But we’ve always moved forward.For America to reverse course, and allow its leader to bring bigotry into the mainstream, would be catastrophic. Hate is a cancer. It’s wrong. It’s un-American. And we must reject every effort to legitimize it.Donald Trump is unfit to be president in every possible way. And his record on work and workers’ rights is terrible. Trump spent his career shipping our jobs overseas, failing to pay us for the work we do, devastating our communities and treating us like second-class citizens. He’s no friend of unions or working people. He always tries to cheat us and destroy us.Trump thinks our wages are too high, and he has stolen our pay time and time again. He said outsourcing creates jobs. He rooted for the housing collapse. He supports right to work 100 percent. And he thinks Carl Icahn—who wakes up every day thinking about ways to destroy our jobs and benefits—would make a good Treasury Secretary. No wonder an independent business review says a Trump presidency would kill 3.5 million jobs.Sisters and brothers, the last thing we need is a morally bankrupt corporate hack running our economy. That’s why on November 8, 2016, working people are going to turn the tables on Donald Trump, and fire him.Thankfully, the Democratic side has been a much different story. The primary contest between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton moved America in a good direction. The Democratic platform yielded the most progressive and unifying vision in a generation. And Hillary Clinton is rising to meet the challenges of tomorrow with a strong agenda of shared prosperity.Hillary is tough. She is smart. She is prepared. And she listens. When she accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention, when she talked about “love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow,” it was clear she heard our call.Hillary Clinton is ready to rewrite the economic rules by reforming or killing corporate trade deals and saying no to the TPP. She has an aggressive plan to rein in Wall Street. She will make the largest investment in infrastructure, public education, workforce development and manufacturing since World War II—to the tune of 10 million new jobs!And most importantly, Hillary Clinton knows the single greatest tool for economic mobility and a growing middle class is collective bargaining. She will protect and expand the freedom of every worker in America to join or form a union—whether they live in Washington or South Carolina!Let me tell you something, brothers and sisters: America is waking up to unionism. This is our chance. This is our moment. To bring out the best in America. To bring out the best in ourselves, and each other. We won’t back up or back down. We’ll stand tall. We’ll register. We’ll vote, and we’ll win!My friends, I want to tell you something personal. In August, I welcomed my first grandchild into the world. My son Rich and his wife had a beautiful baby boy. Becoming a grandfather is a reminder that this movement is not just about us, it’s about building a stronger America for generations to come.It seems like yesterday I was in my backyard with Rich when he was just three or four years old. His grandfather had gotten him one of those battery operated jeeps. He and his buddy Chad were driving around in the backyard.I was out there too—talking on the phone about what else—the union. Rich must have overheard me because he drove up and said: “Dad what’s a union?”So I told him to try to push his jeep up the hill. He strained and struggled and eventually got stuck. Then I told his friend Chad to give him a hand. Working together, they were able to do it. I looked right at my son and said: “That’s a union.”Today, working people are climbing up our own hill. Wages are still too low. Benefits are still too few. Retirement security isn’t secure enough. And the economic rules remain skewed toward the wealthy few.People are understandably cynical. They work hard. They do the right thing. But they can’t seem to get ahead.A lot of our members, and our friends and allies, are turned off by politics right now. Reaching them won’t be easy. But we can’t accept the idea that just because someone is angry or cynical, they can’t be reached. We need to tell people, again and again, that progress is possible, if we are powerful!We’ve suffered through layoffs and takebacks. We’ve seen our hopes and dreams put on hold. But it gets better. I’ve seen it. Trust me. We are in position to win.A better life is right in front of us. All we have to do is reach out and grab it.This fall, we’ve got more than just an election on the line. It's about where our country is going. It's about what kind of nation we're going to be, an America that says you are mine and I am yours, or one that governs by dividing people and fanning their fears.As we stand together and define American values, we’ll defeat the misguided, petty and unnecessary politics of division and disunity. And we’ll send a message to every politician who made the rise of Trump possible: change course or face extinction.America’s labor movement is unleashing the most comprehensive and sophisticated electoral program in our history.We need your help. Talk to your members. Send out your release staff. Ask members to volunteer and turn out at the polls. I want to see union members vote at unprecedented levels. If you haven’t done it already, talk to your central labor council. Name a coordinator for each worksite, so our team has someone to communicate with.When your membership gets involved in the ground campaign, nothing can stop us. When working people speak the truth about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, we will move the needle. You know what it takes. Keep leading the way. Keep blazing a trail forward.So it’s time for us to stand up strong, brothers and sisters. It’s time to mobilize and organize. This electoral season is all about raising wages. We’ll hit the worksites. We’ll talk to members. We’ll walk the streets and knock the doors. This is what a unified labor movement does.

307,Trumka on Labor Day: Momentum is On Our Side,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-labor-day-momentum-our-side,9-5-2016,"Thank you, brothers and sisters.  I’m Rich Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO.It is great to be here.  Happy Labor Day!  This is our day!Since the late 19th century, we’ve spent this first Monday of September celebrating the incredible contributions of America’s workers.Today, we meet at a time when the strength of workers and the popularity of unions is on the rise. I’m thrilled to be here in Cleveland.  Home of the NBA champions!  And a proud union town!Cleveland knows about hard work and sacrifice.  You embody toughness and resilience.And in 64 days you are going to help elect Hillary Clinton president and Tim Kaine vice president.  Not only that, you’re going to send Ted Strickland to the Senate and Rob Portman back to Wall Street.Working people have a lot to be proud of this year.We’re stopping the job-killing, corporate handout known as the TPP.  You did that!We are organizing new workplaces.  We are raising wages at the bargaining table and the ballot box.  We are standing up for workers’ rights and women’s rights and voting rights and immigrant rights.And we are shaping the national debate.We’ve put inequality front and center.We’ve put the focus on good jobs with strong and growing wages. We’ve exposed America’s broken trade rules.We’ve insisted on a fair piece of the wealth we help create.Sisters and brothers, it’s working.The Democratic platform yielded the strongest, most progressive and most unifying vision in 50 years. And Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are rising to meet the challenges of tomorrow with a strong agenda of shared prosperity.Momentum is on our side.  But we cannot afford to be complacent.If we rest, Trump wins.What can I say about Donald Trump?You saw the convention here.  It was like a bad horror movie.Trump says he’s our friend.  Let me ask you this.What kind of friend wants to lower your wages?What kind of friend refuses to pay when he owes you money?What kind of friend sends your job overseas?What kind of friend threatens your retirement?What kind of friend calls you names because of the way you look or talk or worship?Trump is not our friend.  He is a fraud.Working people—union people—real friends—we are going to make sure that Donald never becomes president of the United States.Fortunately, we do have a true friend in this race.  And come January, we are going to start referring to her as Madame President.Hillary Clinton is tough.  She is smart.  She is prepared.  She listens.  And she picked one hell of a running mate in Tim Kaine.  Just ask union members in Virginia.Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are ready to rewrite the economic rules.  They oppose the TPP and support a new direction on trade.  They will make the largest investment in infrastructure, public education, workforce development and manufacturing since World War II—to the tune of 10 million new jobs!And Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are proud champions of collective bargaining—the single greatest tool for economic mobility and a growing middle class in the world!A new report shows that the attack on union rights is the biggest reason why wages are stuck and inequality is growing.  Listen to this: nonunion workers lose $133 billion in wages a year due to the decline in unions.So we know the answer to our problems.  When unions are strong, America is strong.  And collective bargaining isn’t just good for workers, it creates a more stable economy.  When working people have a voice on the job, we are happier and more productive.  That’s good for business.  It’s a win-win.Sisters and brothers, America is waking up to unionism.  This is our chance.  This is our moment.  To bring out the best in America.  To bring out the best in ourselves, and each other. Our vision will lift us up.  We can do it, because we’re the ones who drive the buses and run the trains.  We build the bridges and lift the loads.  We teach the classes and care for the sick.We do America’s work.  We make America go.  We want our share of the American Dream, and we’ll stand for it.  We’ll march for it.  We’ll vote for it.  And we’ll win it!  Thank you!  Happy Labor Day!

308,Trumka to Alaska AFL-CIO Delegates: We Have Beaten Back The Worst—Now Let’s Demand The Best,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-alaska-afl-cio-delegates-we-have-beaten-back-worst-now-lets-demand-best,8-25-2016,"Thank you, Brother Vince [Beltrami].  It’s always good to be with you.  You’re a good, good friend and one hell of a trade unionist.  I’m proud to stand beside you.  Whatever you need, I’m here for you.  And I’ll keep coming back to this great state every single time you ask.  To be honest, I don’t think I’ll wait to be asked.  I’ll book the tickets now.There’s no place like Alaska, sisters and brothers.  Your rivers are wild.  Your salmon are huge. And when oil prices are high, the whole world can seem pretty flush.  But responsible Alaskans know to enjoy the daylight while you’ve got it, because the days get short in the winter, and to sock away some of that oil money for the lean times.Everyone in Alaska should thank the trade unionists in this room, because you mobilized to push your elected leaders to bank $18 billion in savings when oil was over $100 a barrel.  That cushion has given you breathing room, and saved thousands of jobs.Now it’s time for another big effort to counter the politicians whose answer to every question is to cut, cut, cut, to give away public money to millionaires, to roll back investments in our future.There is a better way forward.  You can save thousands of jobs in state services, education and the building trades, and begin to move away from the boom-and-bust cycle of complete dependence on oil.  Every responsible idea should be on the table, and the free-market fanatics should get out of the way.  It is time to kick-start Alaska’s economy and provide stability to opportunity to every single worker.  I know just the man for the job, his name is Vince Beltrami, and if we have anything to say about it, he’ll be leading from the Alaska State Senate after Election Day!Brothers and sisters, you are part of a national movement.  From Alaska to the Lower 48, working family values have been front-and-center this election year, and that’s where we’ll keep them.  Union activism has been driving the debate in America.  Thanks to your activism, and yours and yours, good wages have been on the agenda.  Massive public investment in our infrastructure has been given new life.And it all started with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Two years ago, almost nobody thought these corporate trade deals could be stopped.  But a groundswell of activism led by each of you slammed the brakes on the entire process.  We changed the debate by focusing on trade rules, the structures that for too long have killed jobs and lowered wages.  It worked!  The TPP isn’t dead, but it’s on life support.Think about what else we can accomplish if we bring that same energy and devotion in the weeks and months ahead.  Massive investments in our infrastructure.  Millions of good-paying jobs.  A higher minimum wage.  Equal pay for equal work.  Labor law reform.We can win everything we need to build a better life.  We have beaten back the worst—now let’s demand the best.Our vision will lift us all up.  We can do it, because we’re the ones who drive the buses and run the trains.  We build the bridges and lift the loads.  We teach the classes and care for the sick.  We build America, and defend her.  We do America’s work.  We make America go.  We want our share of the American Dream, brothers and sisters, and we’ll stand for it.  We’ll march for it. We’ll win it!Thank you for your unionism and activism.  We've been fighting for decades to make the debate about the rules of the economy, so they can be changed.  And we’ve done it.  Those rules are now front and center.Our economy isn’t like the weather.  It’s man-made, and if it doesn’t work we can and should fix it.  A few weeks ago, I was in Philadelphia for the Democratic National Convention.  It was truly inspiring.  Democrats nominated a ticket that opposes the TPP, is committed to raising wages for working families and understands that when workers are strong. when unions are strong, America is strong.I’ll have more to say about the Democrats shortly, but I can’t let another moment pass without talking about Donald Trump.  Where do I even start?In just the last month, he dishonored the memory of a fallen hero by criticizing a Gold Star family.  He said he always wanted a Purple Heart.  He called President Obama the founder of ISIS.  He said the best way for working women to deal with sexual harassment is either “be strong” or find another job.  He joked about killing his opponent.  Then he said he was being sarcastic, but “not that sarcastic.”Sisters and brothers, these moments reveal Donald Trump for who he really is, not just as a candidate but as a man.Donald Trump is not only dangerous, he’s blatantly dishonest.  A recent study showed he tells a whopper every five minutes.  Don’t believe a thing he says.  He pretends to love our cause, but he’s a fraud.Trump has spent his career shipping our jobs overseas, failing to pay us for the work we do, devastating our communities and treating us like second-class citizens.  He wants us to believe he will stand with working people and defend unions when he spent his entire life trying to cheat us and destroy us.Here’s all you need to know about the Donald.  He thinks our wages are too high, and he has stolen our pay time and time again.  He said outsourcing creates jobs.  He rooted for the housing collapse.  He supports right to work 100 percent.  And he thinks Carl Icahn—who takes glee in killing our jobs and benefits—would make a good Treasury Secretary.  No wonder a business firm says Trump’s business plans would cost our nation 3.5 million jobs.  That’s right, 3.5 million jobs.  Donald Trump would make America unemployed again.Trump only cares about one thing: himself.  If you took the words “I, me and myself” out of his vocabulary, he’d be speechless.Donald Trump is profoundly unfit to be president.  That’s why on November 8, 2016, working people are going to turn the tables, and fire him.Thankfully, the Democratic side has been a much different story.  The primary contest between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton moved America in the right direction.  The Democratic platform yielded the strongest, most progressive and most unifying vision in 50 years.  And Hillary Clinton is rising to meet the challenges of tomorrow with a strong agenda of shared prosperity.Hillary is tough.  She is smart.  She is prepared.  And she listens.  When she accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention, when she talked about “love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow,” it was clear she heard our call.  In Tim Kaine, she chose a running mate who has always fought for us.  Just ask union members in Virginia.Hillary is ready to rewrite the economic rules by reforming or killing corporate trade deals and saying no to the TPP.  She has an aggressive plan to rein in Wall Street.  She will make the largest investment in infrastructure, public education, workforce development and manufacturing since World War II—to the tune of 10 million new jobs!And finally, this is the icing on the cake, Hillary Clinton knows that the single greatest tool for economic mobility and a growing middle class is collective bargaining.  Hillary will protect and expand the freedom of every worker in America to join or form a union.Let me tell you something, brothers and sisters: America is tilting toward unionism.  This is our chance.  This is our moment.  To bring out the best in America.  To bring out the best in ourselves, and each other.  We won’t back up or back down.  We’ll stand tall.  We’ll register. We’ll vote, and we’ll win! My friends, I want to tell you something personal.  Two weeks ago, I welcomed my first grandchild into the world.  My son Rich and his wife had a beautiful baby boy.

And the economic rules remain skewed toward the wealthy few.But we have the power to change that.In the end, this is more than just an election.  It's about where our country is going.  It's about what kind of nation we're going to be, an America that says you are mine and I am yours, or one that governs by dividing and fanning fears.By standing together, and defining American values for the ages, we’ll defeat the misguided, petty and unnecessary politics of division and disunity.  And we’ll send a message to every Republican who made the rise of Trump possible: change course or face extinction.America’s labor movement is unleashing the most comprehensive and sophisticated electoral program in our history.I’m asking you to step up.  I know you campaign hard every election year, but we need you to do more.  Every local union in Alaska should designate an election point person.  We have to be united: big unions and small, public sector and private. And we have to be united around a simple but powerful idea: raising wages.  It’s our agenda and our mission.We know the single best way to raise wages is with a collective bargaining agreement.  Good old-fashioned unionism will always be our top priority.  That’s why it’s so important to elect leaders who will stand with us.  When we win at the ballot box, we win at the bargaining table. When we win political campaigns, we win organizing campaigns.We’re building a movement.  It’s a movement where unions grow and inequality shrinks.  It’s a movement where you can grab onto the American Dream no matter what you look like, where you come from, how much money your parents have or who you love.When it comes to doing right for working people, we define that vision.  We embody those values.  We will fix what’s broken in our country.  We have unity.  We have solidarity.  And we are ready to win justice and jobs today and a better tomorrow.We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  We’ll stand for it.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity.  Real solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line.  And my picket line is your picket line.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm-in-arm.  All day.  Every day.  As long as it takes.  To win together. To grow together.  To build the America we can have, and must have, and will have.Thank you.  God bless you, and have a wonderful convention.

309,Trumka to Nevada AFL-CIO Delegates: This is More Than Just an Election,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-nevada-afl-cio-delegates-more-just-election,8-24-2016,"Thank you, Brother Danny [Thompson], for your truly generous introduction.  I love coming to Nevada.  You have some of the strongest unions in America.  And you have an absolute giant in Harry Reid.  On behalf of the 12.5 million members of the AFL-CIO, I want to thank Senator Reid for his incredible service to the labor movement, to Nevada and to our nation.  Listen, nobody needs to tell working people in this state about the union advantage.  Collective bargaining transformed Las Vegas, and lifted up the entire entertainment industry.  Across Nevada, each and every one of you continues to show us how unionism works.  You do it in the building trades.  You do it in our schools, hospitals, grocery stores, factories and too many places to name.When we stand together, wages go up.  Consumers have more money to spend.  Employers feel competitive pressure to do better for their workers.  That’s the strength of collective bargaining and collective action.  We have the power to set off a race to the top.We raise the bar in politics, too.  When you and your members get onto the front lines, we build momentum for our issues and elect candidates who share our working family values.In 2016, we need a strong and united effort.  As you know, Nevada is one of our priority states. We need every single local union to take part in the AFL-CIO’s shared campaign.  Big and small.  Public sector and private sector.  To make it work, every worksite should have a point of contact, someone who can be plugged in with the latest information.You’ve got key races up and down the ballot.  If we work together, if we stand united, if we all have skin in the game, we will elect candidates from the state house to the White House who are ready to change the rules of our economy.We can build a future where wages are high and inequality is low, where work is safe and workers are strong, where retirement security is actually secure.  It’s all right there in front of us. We just have to reach out and grab it.We have tremendous candidates this year.  We’re going to send Jacklyn Rosen and Ruben Kihuen to Congress.  And of course there is Catherine Cortez Masto who will make a fantastic Senator and build on the legacy of Harry Reid.  That’s not all.  We have a real chance to win a pro-worker Nevada legislature that will protect prevailing wage and stand up for our rights.You are part of a national movement.  In every corner of this country, working people are leading the debate.  We are putting the focus on good jobs with strong and growing wages. We’ve made it clear.  We intend to grab a fair piece of the wealth we help create.Our activism has shifted the conversation on trade.  Instead of continuing to get run over by corporate trade deals, we’re leading the fight to write new global rules that lift up all working people.This progress has been possible because our agenda is driving our politics, not the other way around.  We’ve invested in our own capacity and focused on building our own power, and now we’re using that strength to win for our issues and the candidates who support us.Working people are winning the debate.  Now it’s time to win some elections!We can do it, if we stand together.  We need each other.  We need your mobilization and groundwork.We know unity.  We practice solidarity.  When we stand together, no one can turn us aside.We built the middle class once, and we’ll do it again.We build the bridges and the factories.  We bake the bread and serve it, too.  We drive the rigs and carry the loads.  We do it all.  We do what it takes.  We answer the call.  We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night.  We don’t mind hard work.  We do it with pride.  We won’t be faced down or pushed around, and we will NOT be denied.Thank you for your unionism and your activism.  We've been fighting for decades to make the debate about the rules of the economy, so they can be changed.  And we’ve done it.  These rules are now front and center.Our economy isn’t like the weather.  It’s man-made, and if it doesn’t work, we can and should fix it.A couple weeks ago, I was in Philadelphia for the Democratic National Convention.  It was truly inspiring.  Democrats nominated a ticket that opposes the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, is committed to raising wages for working families and understands that when workers are strong, when unions are strong, America is strong.I’ll have more to say about the Democrats shortly, but I can’t let another moment pass without addressing Donald Trump.  Where do I even start?In just the last month, he dishonored the memory of a fallen hero by criticizing a Gold Star family.  He said he always wanted a Purple Heart.  He called President Obama the founder of ISIS.  He said the best way for working women to deal with sexual harassment is either “be strong” or find another job.  He called for “extreme vetting” of immigrants.  Sisters and brothers, these moments reveal Donald Trump for who he really is, not just as a candidate but as a man.Donald Trump is not only dangerous, he’s blatantly dishonest.  A recent study showed he tells a whopper every five minutes.  Don’t believe a thing he says.  He pretends to love our cause, but he’s a fraud.Trump has made a career of shipping our jobs overseas, failing to pay us for the work we do, devastating our communities and treating us like second-class citizens. Trump thinks our wages are too high, and he has stolen our pay time and time again.  He said outsourcing creates jobs.  He rooted for the housing collapse.  He supports right to work 100 percent.  And he thinks Carl Icahn—who likes nothing better than killing our jobs and taking our benefits—would make a good Treasury Secretary. If you want to know where Donald Trump really stands, ask the brave men and women at Trump Tower in Las Vegas.  First, Trump hired a union-busting firm to discourage workers from organizing.  The workers won anyway.  Then, Trump refused to recognize the union.  He dragged his feet.  He filed an appeal.  He did everything except bargain a first contract.  Sisters and brothers, if you actively block our fundamental right to speak up together for better wages and benefits, you will never, ever, ever get our support.Donald Trump is profoundly unfit to be president.  That’s why on November 8, 2016, working people are going to turn the tables, and tell him, “You’re fired!”Thankfully, the Democratic side has been a much different story.  The primary contest between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton moved America in the right direction.  The Democratic platform yielded the strongest, most progressive and most unifying vision in a generation.  And Hillary Clinton is rising to meet the challenges of tomorrow with a strong agenda of shared prosperity.Hillary is tough.  She is smart.  She is prepared.  And she listens.  When she accepted the nomination and talked about “love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow,” it was clear she heard our call.  And she picked one hell of a running mate. Tim Kaine has always had our back.  While Republican Vice Presidential nominee Mike Pence was repealing his state’s prevailing wage law, Tim was working with us to invest in infrastruc-ture and education and new technology. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are ready to rewrite the economic rules.  That begins with stopping the TPP and reforming or killing our failed corporate trade deals.  The Democratic ticket has an aggressive plan to rein in Wall Street.  They will make the largest investment in infrastructure, public education, workforce development and manufacturing since World War II—to the tune of 10 million new jobs!And finally, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine know that the single greatest tool for economic mobility and a growing middle class is collective bargaining.  They will protect and expand the freedom of every worker in America to join or form a union—including those at Trump Tower.Let me tell you something, brothers and sisters: America is waking up to unionism.  This is our chance.  This is our moment.  To bring out the best in America.  To bring out the best in ourselves, and each other.  We won’t back up or back down.  We’ll stand tall.  We’ll register. We’ll vote, and we’ll win! My friends, I want to tell you something personal.  Two weeks ago, I welcomed my first grandchild into the world.  My son Rich and his wife had a beautiful baby boy.  Becoming a grandfather is a reminder that this movement is not just about us, it’s about building a stronger America for generations to come.It seems like yesterday I was in the backyard with my son when he was just three or four years old.  His grandfather had gotten him one of those battery operated jeeps.  He and his buddy Chad were driving around in the backyard.I was out there too—talking on the phone about what else—the union.  Rich must have overheard me because he drove up and said: “Dad what’s a union?”So I told him to try to push his jeep up the hill.  He strained and struggled and eventually got stuck.  Then I told his friend Chad to give him a hand.  Working together, they were able to do it.  I looked right at my son and said: “That’s a union.”Today, working people are climbing up our own hill.  Wages are still too low.  Benefits are still too few.  And the economic rules remain skewed toward the wealthy few.We have the power to change that.In the end, this is more than just an election.  It's about where our country is going.  It's about what kind of nation we're going to be, an America that says you are mine and I am yours, or one that governs by dividing and fanning fears.By standing together, and defining American values for the ages, we’ll defeat the misguided, petty and unnecessary politics of division and disunity.  And we’ll send a message to every Republican who made the rise of Donald Trump possible: change course or face extinction.America’s labor movement is unleashing the most comprehensive and sophisticated electoral program in our history.  We need your help.  Talk to your members.  Ask them to volunteer and turn out at the polls.  I want to see union members vote at unprecedented levels. When your membership gets involved in the ground campaign, nothing can stop us.  When working people speak the truth about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, when we fight for our issues and our candidates, great things happen.So it’s time for us to stand up strong, brothers and sisters, and stand together.  It’s time to mobilize and organize.  This electoral season is all about raising wages.  We’ll hit the worksites.  We’ll talk to members.  We’ll walk the streets and knock the doors.  This is what a unified labor movement does.  This is what it looks like when working people stand together, union strong!And after the ballots are counted and the elections have been won, we’ll be in a better position to organize in the workplace, and win strong contracts and better pay.Together, we will create a better tomorrow.  We’ll have to work for it, sisters and brothers.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.  Ironworkers with UFCW.  Steel with Teachers and Taxi Workers. Culinary, Painters and Electricians.  All of us together.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm in arm.  All day.  Every day.  Voting.  Fighting.  Winning.  Together.  To bring out the best in each other and ourselves.  To bring out the best in America.  To build the nation we can have and must have and will have!Thank you!  And God bless you!

310,Trumka to Ironworkers Convention: Reach Even Higher,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-ironworkers-convention-reach-even-higher,8-23-2016,"Thank you, Brother Eric [Dean].  It’s great to be with such a storied and important union. America’s big buildings, our skyscrapers, bridges, factories and other structures are the symbols of who we are as a people.  I’m incredibly impressed with the work you do.I’m also impressed with your organizing spirit.  Congratulations on your big wins in Montana and Ontario, and your ongoing internal organizing work.  Give yourselves a round of applause!Sisters and brothers, you and your members set the standard with your contracts.  You set the scale with your wages, your workplace safety, your pensions and your health care.As trade unionists, the men and women of the American labor movement raise the bar across this entire country with our solidarity and activism.When we stand together, the entire economy improves.  Wages go up.  Consumers have more money to spend.  Employers feel competitive pressure to do better for their workers.  That’s the strength of collective bargaining and collective action.  We have the power to set off a race to the top.We raise the bar in politics, too.  When we get off the sidelines and onto the front lines, we build momentum for our issues and elect candidates who share our working family values.And let me tell you something, every time you send an apprentice to knock on doors with a labor canvass, they gain a little more understanding of what it means to be a trade unionist.  They get a feel for what it means to be involved and talk to our families and friends and neighbors about the issues we face together.This year, working people are leading the national debate.  We, working people, put the focus on good jobs with strong and growing wages.  We’ve made it clear that working people should be sharing in the wealth we help create.  We’ve shifted the conversation on trade.  Instead of continuing to get run over by corporate trade deals, we’re leading the fight to write new global rules that lift up all working people.  We’ve been able to make headway because our agenda is driving our politics, not the other way around.This year our agenda has influenced and inspired America’s leaders more than any time in the past 50 years.  That’s why I believe we need to throw everything we have into politics.  Working people are winning the debate.  Now it’s time to win the election.When you go back to your homes after this convention, I want you to reach even higher.  We need your mobilization and groundwork.  The leaders we elect, from the state house to the White House, will have a tremendous impact on infrastructure spending, on Davis-Bacon, on PLAs and other pocketbook issues for your members.  You can make the difference.  Working people need it.  The labor movement needs it.  Your family, neighbors and community needs it.We know unity.  We practice solidarity.  Together, we can show America that when we stand together, we cannot be turned aside.We built the American middle class once, and we’ll do it again.We build the bridges and the factories.  We drive the trucks and carry the loads.  From skyscrapers to oil rigs, we do it all.  We do what it takes.  We answer the call.  We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night.  We don’t mind hard work.  We do it with pride.  We won’t be faced down or pushed around, and we will NOT be denied.I want to thank each and every one of you for your unionism and activism.

He called President Obama the founder of ISIS.  He said the best way for working women to deal with sexual harassment is either “be strong” or find another job.  He joked about killing his opponent.  Then he said he was being sarcastic, but “not that sarcastic.”Sisters and brothers, these moments reveal Donald Trump for who he really is, not just as a candidate but as a man.Donald Trump is not only dangerous, he’s dishonest.  A recent study showed he tells a whopper every five minutes.  Don’t believe a thing he says.  He pretends to love our cause, but he’s a fraud.Trump has spent his career shipping our jobs overseas, failing to pay us for the work we do, devastating our communities and treating us like second-class citizens.  Now he wants us to believe he will stand with working people and defend unions when he spent his entire life trying to cheat us and destroy us.Here’s all you need to know about the Donald.  He thinks our wages are too high, and he has stolen our pay time and time again.  He said outsourcing creates jobs.  He rooted for the housing collapse.  He supports right to work 100 percent.  And he thinks Carl Icahn—who takes glee in killing our jobs and benefits—would make a good Treasury Secretary.  No wonder a business firm says Trump’s business plans would cost our nation 3.5 million jobs.  That’s right, 3.5 million jobs.  Donald Trump would make America unemployed again.Donald Trump is profoundly unfit to be president.

And didn’t she choose a great running mate?  I heard Tim Kaine was here yesterday.  Tim has always stood with us.  In fact, he is working with the Virginia labor movement to defeat a ballot initiative that would make right-to-work part of the state constitution.  Tim understands we should be expanding workers’ rights, not taking them away.Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are ready to rewrite the economic rules by reforming or killing corporate trade deals and saying no to the TPP.  They have an aggressive plan to rein in Wall Street.  They will make the largest investment in infrastructure, public education, workforce development and manufacturing since World War II—to the tune of 10 million new jobs!And finally, this is the icing on the cake, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine know that the single greatest tool for economic mobility and a growing middle class is collective bargaining.  They will protect and expand the freedom of every worker in America to join or form a union.Let me tell you something, brothers and sisters: America is tilting toward unionism.  This is our chance.

Talk to your members.  Send out your apprentice teams.  Ask them to volunteer and turn out at the polls.  I want to see union members vote at unprecedented levels.  If you haven’t done it already, talk to your central labor council.  Name a coordinator for each worksite, so our team has someone to communicate with.When your membership gets involved in the ground campaign, nothing can stop us.  When working people speak the truth about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, we will move the needle.  The choice is clear.  You know what it takes.  Keep leading the way.  Keep blazing a trail forward. So it’s time for us to stand up strong, brothers and sisters.  It’s time to mobilize and organize.  This electoral season is all about raising wages.

311,Trumka to Postal Workers Convention: Your Reach is Universal,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-postal-workers-convention-your-reach-universal,8-22-2016,"Thank you, Brother Mark [Dimondstein].  It’s great to be with the Postal Workers!  Thank you for inviting me to your convention.The American Postal Workers is a powerful union.  You perform a vital government service for our nation, one of the few required by the U.S. Constitution.  Nobody is more patriotic.  Nobody is more disciplined and focused.  Nobody has an impact like yours on every single community in America.  Your reach is universal.Just the other day, I was talking to somebody about the Postal Service, and off the top of their head they knew two facts that surprised me.  The first involved the pension prefunding crisis.  I don’t think those exact words were used, but the idea was there.  People get it.  The second was about the success of the Postal Service in the digital age.  Folks understand how e-commerce means more package delivery and a stronger service.The Postal Service is critical for America, but your enemies are on the attack.  You and your brothers and sisters in the Grand Alliance have reversed these damaging and false narratives recently, and you’ve done it the old-fashioned way.  Your activists and members have been writing letters to the editor, lobbying your local elected leaders and talking to friends, neighbors and anyone else who will listen, and you’ve changed the national conversation about the work you do.After Election Day, that activism will help change federal law to finally end the manufactured crisis at the post office.  We’ll return the Postal Service to solid footing, and we’ll do it without any poison pills.  Nobody’s talking about cutting Saturday delivery anymore.  That’s a win, and I love it that seven-day-delivery is now an idea.  That’s progress. Look what a difference four years makes.  Back in 2012, the Republican platform called on the privatization of the Postal Service and the Democratic platform didn’t mention you.  Well, this year, the Republicans were silent on the post office, and the Democratic platform included key priorities like postal banking!  Activism works, sisters and brothers.  You did that.You are part of a national movement.  Working people are putting good jobs, raising wages and strong unions front and center, and we intend to keep them there.  We are winning the debate. Now it’s time to win the election.When we fight for union candidates and union values, we’re fighting for justice!We stand for justice at the ballot box.  We want every eligible citizen to be able to cast a vote. That means saying NO to discriminatory voter ID laws and YES to universal vote by mail.We stand for justice in the workplace.  Everyone who wants to join or form a union should be able to do so, free from interference.  And employers who violate that right should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.We want justice for our families and communities.  That means good schools, safe roads, affordable health care and quality public services—whether it’s Social Security for our seniors or health care for our veterans.And we want equal justice in our workplaces, our streets and our courts, no matter who you are, who you love, where you were born or how much money your family has.  These are our priorities, brothers and sisters!We can win it, if we work for it!Your mobilization and your groundwork will make the difference.  When your members turn out, you change hearts and minds.  You convince undecideds.  You move the needle.  In every single race, from the state house to the White House, your voice and your vote for working family candidates will be among the most influential in America.You know unity.  You practice solidarity.  You are there every time America calls.  You are trusted.  You are reliable.  You get the job done.That’s what working people do.  We do what it takes, no matter the cost.  We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night.  We don’t mind hard work.  We do it with pride.  We won’t be faced down or pushed around, and we will not be denied.Brothers and sisters, it’s time to get serious.  This is an unprecedented election.  There’s never been someone as unqualified, unfit, unprepared and unhinged as Donald Trump.  Electing Trump would be a national disaster and an international catastrophe.  America truly stands at a crossroads.  This isn’t about Democrats and Republicans or progressives and conservatives.  The 2016 presidential election is a choice between sanity and insanity.Donald Trump is dangerous for our country, for our communities and for our children.Trump has talked about shooting people multiple times.  That’s not a gaffe, not a misunderstanding.  It’s who he is. Trump advocated treason, actually suggesting that the Russians should commit espionage on American soil.He said he would order our military personnel to commit war crimes.  He insulted the parents of an American war hero.  He called President Obama the founder of ISIS.Sisters and brothers, these moments reveal Donald Trump for who he truly is, not only as a candidate, but as a man.  He’s not like Mitt Romney, who I disagreed with, but who I respect. He’s not like John McCain, who I campaigned against and yet admire as a great American.Even if you overlook Trump’s shocking and disgraceful behavior, you’d still have a con man who spent decades shipping our jobs overseas, failing to pay us for the work we do, devastating our communities and treating us like second-class citizens. Trump says he’d be good for workers.  But remember, he is an Olympic-level liar.  Fact checkers have looked at it.  He tells a whopper every five minutes.Donald Trump has misled millions of Americans into thinking he has the answers.  He doesn’t.Here’s all you need to know about the Donald.  He thinks our wages are too high, and he has stolen our pay time and time again.  He said outsourcing creates jobs.  He rooted for the housing collapse.  He supports right to work 100 percent.  And he thinks Carl Icahn—who has spent his life killing our jobs and benefits—would make a good Treasury Secretary.  It is no wonder that the business firm Moody’s says Trump’s economic plan would cost our nation 3.5 million jobs. That’s right.  Donald Trump would make America unemployed again.The good news is that working people have real solutions to real problems.  It’s called the Raising Wages agenda.  It starts with the absolute truth that each and every one of us should be decently paid for the work we do.  And we define what decent means!  It says no one should make less than the minimum wage, everyone should make a living wage and collective bargaining should be available for all workers.  It covers everything we care about.  Fair trade.  Just immigration.  Equal pay for equal work.  And more.We have a champion for this agenda, and her name is Hillary Rodham Clinton.Hillary Clinton is tough.  She is smart.  She is prepared.  And she listens.  When Hillary Clinton accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention, when she talked about “love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow,” it was clear she heard our call.  Hillary is the right candidate at the right time, poised to lead us away from the darkness of inequality and trickle down and toward the light of raising wages and shared prosperity.We've been fighting for 30 years now to put the rules of the economy up for debate.  This is our opportunity.  Hillary is calling for a new direction on trade and opposes the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.  We’ll hold Hillary and all of our elected leaders to that pledge.  And by the way, we’re prepared to kill the TPP if anyone tries to push it through during the lame duck session.Hillary has an aggressive plan to rein in Wall Street.  She’ll tax financial transactions so we can make massive investments in infrastructure, public education, workforce development and manufacturing.  She will make the largest investment in jobs since World War II, and that’s exactly what America needs.  Moody’s, the same firm that gave Trump’s economic plan an F, gave Hillary Clinton an A+, because she will create over 10 million jobs!And finally, this is the icing on the cake, Hillary Clinton knows that the single greatest tool for economic mobility and a growing middle class is collective bargaining.  Hillary will protect and expand the freedom of every worker in America to join or form a union.This year, the AFL-CIO has launched the largest, most sophisticated and comprehensive electoral program in our history.  Our goal is to advance a working family agenda.  Period.Our strength grows from our unity.  It comes from our activism.  It’s up to us to motivate each other.  We need the Postal Workers.  I’m asking you to talk to your members.  Encourage them to volunteer and turn out like never before.  If you haven’t done it already, talk to your Central Labor Council.  Name a coordinator for each branch, so we have someone to communicate with.The change we need, is so close.  It’s right there in front of us.  All we have to do, is reach out and grab it.  All we have to do, is get more people off the sidelines and onto the front lines.In the end, this is more than just an election.  It's about where our country is going.  It's about what kind of nation we're going to be, an America that says you are mine and I am yours, or one that governs by dividing and fanning fears.We are still one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  But that promise is not self-fulfilling, sisters and brothers.  We have to work for it.  So let’s get to work.When the Postal Workers hit the streets, nothing can stop us.  When your members speak the truth about Donald Trump, he will crumble like a house of cards. We’ll fix what’s broken in our country.  Together, we’ll create a better tomorrow.  It won’t be easy.  We’ll have to work for it, sisters and brothers.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm in arm.  All day.  Every day.  Voting.  Fighting.  Winning.  Together.  To bring out the best in each other and ourselves.  To bring out the best in America.  To build the nation we can have and must have and will have!Thank you, Postal Workers!  And God bless you!

312,Trumka to Federal Mediators: Labor-Management Partnerships Key to Future of Work,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-federal-mediators-labor-management-partnerships-key-future-work,8-18-2016,"Thank you, Allison [Beck], for that introduction. I appreciate your leadership and your friendship. I am honored to be here today for this important discussion. I look forward to having a real dialogue about the future of collective bargaining.To my sisters and brothers here from labor, it is always good to see you. Thank you for the work you are doing each and every day to make life better for working people. Our job has never been more important.To my friends here from management, I want to commend you for being willing to listen to our concerns, meet us halfway and build an economy that is good for business and for workers.Finally, to the mediators in the room, including Allison, I’d say this: Thank you for your service. You are the guardians of collective bargaining. Your professionalism and objectivity are second to none. And we are all better for it.Now I believe this room is evenly divided between labor, management and neutral. We may play different roles, but we share common goals. Each of us wants American companies to succeed. Each of us wants workers to be safe, satisfied and productive. Each of us wants to avoid work stoppages. We can’t live long without a paycheck, and a business can’t either. When business and labor don’t get along, entire communities suffer.And yet we cannot just go along to get along. The labor movement refuses to allow our working families, our communities, and yes, our businesses to continue to suffer a slow and painful death, as more and more of America’s assets become concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. It’s wrong. It has to stop.Collective bargaining is the most powerful tool for bringing our economy back into balance.At the AFL-CIO, we are experimenting with new forms of collective bargaining, and we’re reinvigorating what’s tried and true. But we don’t own the idea of collective bargaining, or the concept of a strong and growing middle class. That’s for all of us. In that sense, the future of collective bargaining is on our hands. And it will take all of us to preserve it, strengthen it and expand it.It’s critical that we continue to have conversations like this.As some of you may know, I am a third-generation coal miner from a small town in Pennsylvania. I was taught the importance of collective bargaining from an early age. We weren’t rich. But my dad’s union job put food on the table and a roof over our head. We had the dignity of work and the confidence that the next generation would do better than the last. That’s what the American Dream is all about.Today that dream has slipped out of reach for far too many families. Wages are stubbornly flat. Income inequality has reached levels that shock the conscience. Sixty-three percent of Americans say they don’t have enough savings to cover a $500 car repair or a $1,000 medical bill. A majority of workers are living paycheck to paycheck. And for the first time in our nation’s history, our children may inherit a lower standard of living. This is the issue of our time.Pope Francis has said it. I’ve said it. President Obama has said it. We are suffering a moral and economic crisis. The policies that have left workers weaker and poorer—and the elected politicians who wrote those rules—have not been held to account. As a result, a growing number of Americans are both angry and anxious. And who can blame them? They work hard. They pay taxes. They do right by their families and communities. Yet they can feel their future slipping away.This anger is manifest in the 2016 election, in the rise of a democratic socialist and also a dangerous demagogue. This much is clear—people are fed up with going along to get along. We are tired of the Wall Street and Washington elite writing the rules for themselves. And we are ready to use our voice and our vote to make big changes.We have already begun to use our voice. This year, working people have led the national debate. We’ve put the focus on good jobs with strong and growing wages. We’ve made clear that workers should be sharing in the wealth we help create. We’ve called for an end to the tax and trade policies that outsources our jobs and widens the gap between the rich and the rest of us.But we also know that the single most effective tool for building an economy of shared prosperity is collective bargaining. When workers sit down across the table from our employers and bargain, we bring home higher wages, have greater access to health care and a pension and are more likely to be safe on the job. Most importantly, workers who bargain collectively have a voice, a say in the terms and conditions of work. And when we raise the bar for ourselves, we raise the bar for everyone. Other employers raise pay and improve benefits to attract and keep the best people.When I first won elected office in my union, the United Mine Workers of America, I was on the safety committee. So my first real personal experience with collective bargaining centered on the life-and-death realities of coal mining work. Being at that table changes you. It gives you an appreciation for how difficult it is to achieve even minimal progress. And it shows you how contract language plays out in reality. A rule about mine safety is more than just words. It means the difference between a deadly roof fall, or a father returning home to his family.This same truth applies today. When we negotiate an extra personal day, it means someone can spend more time with a loved one. When we protect our pensions, it means a senior can retire with dignity and security. When we win fairer scheduling language, it means a working mom can balance family and career. That’s the power of collective bargaining.As president of the UMWA, I had the privilege of being involved in all facets of collective bargaining. I traveled to New Mexico and Arizona to bargain alongside locals that were mostly Navajo. I went to Montana and Missouri and Illinois. I crisscrossed Appalachia. At each stop, I had one simple purpose: to win the best wages and benefits possible and then to keep up our end of the bargain, which is to be the hardest working, best trained, and most productive workforce in the world.To me, that is the essence of labor-management cooperation. We share the same basic concerns. In many ways, we are like a railroad. Labor is one track. Management is the other. But we are both heading in the same direction. And if one track isn’t on firm footing, we’ve all got a big problem.I know this conference will highlight a number of successful partnerships. Ford and the UAW. American Water and the Utility Workers. Even the Labor Management Cooperation Committee here in Chicago that has successfully held down health care premiums for city employees.The key stakeholders in these relationships can tell you better than anyone what works. My view is this: there must be an open line of communication—and not just during contract negotiations. Each side must demonstrate a willingness to have hard conversations in a respectful way and to find common ground.Now listen, there are some in management who think negotiating with employees is beneath them. They bring a dismissive and often hostile attitude to the bargaining table. There are some on the union side who think it’s not the job of workers to make their employers profitable and that anything gained without a fight doesn’t constitute a win. I disagree with both of these perspectives.I tell my union friends all the time—an unprofitable company does us no good. So we have a responsibility to help our employers succeed. But we also must have the freedom to bargain for a share of that success. We want an equitable piece of the profits we help create. That’s the flip side of the shared sacrifice we face in the hard times. Again and again, we’ve done our share of sacrificing. We also want shared prosperity in the good times.This is where the critical work of FMCS comes in—helping labor and management bridge the gap. In general, mediators don’t like to talk about themselves. It’s not in their nature. So I want to spend a little time giving my perspective on the job they do. From the moment FMCS receives notice of an expiring contract, mediators swing into action. They contact the parties, offer their services, probe for middle ground and design a process that can work. Mediation can go on for weeks at a time, in hotel conference rooms and factory basements. Tensions can get high, yet so are the stakes. Day and night, these public servants do everything they can to encourage cooperation, improve communication and preserve labor peace.On behalf of the 12.5 million working women and men of the AFL-CIO, I just want to say thank you for everything you do, and the spirit in which you do it.One of the most challenging labor disputes to come before FMCS was the Verizon strike. I won’t pretend I was somehow objective in that case. I marched on picket lines with CWA and IBEW members who were fighting for a better life. I found the company’s initial offer to be wholly inadequate. But I wanted a resolution as much as anyone. Allison was sent in to mediate the conflict, along with Labor Secretary Tom Perez, which shows you the incredible magnitude of this particular work stoppage. In the end, the sides reached a new contract with substantial raises and enhanced job security. And not only that: they agreed to set up committees focused on improving their relationship. Friends, if labor and Verizon can find a way to come together, anything is possible.A reporter at BusinessWeek recently asked me if there should be more strikes in the United States. I certainly hope not.Our goal is to have employers sit down with workers and bargain in good faith. But when you have companies that, instead of treating us as assets to be invested in, view us as costs to be cut, there’s going to be conflict. And by the way, our system is designed for conflict. You petition the National Labor Relations Board to form a new union, and the first thing that happens is your employer starts firing people illegally, threatening to outsource your jobs, ripping you apart.If a person that you went out on a first date with did nothing but say, “You’re such an idiot, you’re a thief, you have no redeeming value whatsoever,” do you think there would be a second date? That’s what U.S. labor relations does. It makes you fight. It’s corrosive, but it doesn’t have to be that way. In most other countries, it isn’t.So to strengthen bargaining, we need to fix organizing. Common sense tells us it is virtually impossible to be enemies during the unionization process and then turn around and be partners at the bargaining table. That’s why the AFL-CIO is working hard to pass the WAGE Act, legislation which would dramatically increase fines against those who break the law. This isn’t about punishing anyone. It’s about ensuring a fair process and incentivizing employers to cooperate from the outset. Earlier this month, after a majority of Zara employees in New York City signed cards indicating their desire to be represented by the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union, the company agreed. That kind of attitude can help set a positive tone as the sides head into first contract negotiations.There is a lot of discussion about what the future of collective bargaining will look like. There are those on the left who suggest, wrongly, that the current model will cease to exist. There are those on the right who are trying to legislate collective bargaining out of existence.I see a different path forward. I believe we are in the early stages of a worker-led resurgence where collective bargaining and collective action are at the forefront of labor relations.Millennials, who now outnumber Baby Boomers, overwhelmingly support unions. More and more working people are embracing the power and possibility of banding together for a better life. The emergence of the digital economy has created a new urgency about how best for working people to use our voices collectively on the job. And leaders across the political spectrum are feeling the groundswell of a nation that has reached its tipping point.America needs collective bargaining. We need it to help businesses grow, workers succeed and communities thrive. We need it to create a level playing field, a fairer economy and a stronger country.Labor and management, working together, communicating and compromising. Sacrificing and listening. Reaching common ground. Using common sense. Benefitting the common good.That is the future at work. And if we stumble, FMCS will be there to get us back on track.Thank you very much.

313,Trumka to Letter Carriers Convention: Activism Works,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-letter-carriers-convention-activism-works,8-17-2016,"Thank you, Brother Fred [Rolando].  It’s great to be with the Letter Carriers!  Thank you for inviting me to your convention.The National Association of Letter Carriers is a powerful union, and you should be.  You perform a vital government service to our nation, one of the few required by the U.S. Constitution.There is no union more disciplined and focused than the Letter Carriers.  That’s a credit to you. The proof is in the success, for example, of the single-largest one-day food drive in America.  It’s incredible.  Your reach is universal.Just the other day, I was talking to somebody about the Postal Service, and off the top of their head they knew two facts that surprised me.  The first involved the pension prefunding crisis.  I don’t think those exact words were used, but the idea was there.  People get it.  The second was about the success of the Postal Service in the digital age.  Folks understand how e-commerce means more package delivery and a stronger service.The Postal Service is critical for America, but your enemies are on the attack.  You have reversed these damaging and false narratives recently, and you’ve done it the old-fashioned way. Your activists and members have been writing letters to the editor, lobbying your local elected leaders and talking to friends, neighbors and anyone else who will listen, and you’ve changed the national conversation about the work you do.After Election Day, that activism will help change federal law to finally end the manufactured crisis at the post office.  We’ll return the Postal Service to solid footing, and we’ll do it without any poison pills.  Nobody’s talking about cutting Saturday delivery anymore, and I love the fact that seven-day-delivery is now an idea.  That’s progress.  Look what a difference four years makes.  Back in 2012, the Republican platform called for the privatization of the Postal Service and the Democratic platform didn’t mention you.  Well, this year, the Republicans were silent on the post office, and the Democratic platform included key priorities like postal banking! Activism works, sisters and brothers.  You did that.You are part of a national movement.  Working people are putting good jobs, raising wages and strong unions front and center, and we intend to keep them there.  We are winning the debate.  Now it’s time to win the election.Your mobilization and your groundwork are absolutely critical.  Nobody pounds the pavement like the Letter Carriers.  You’re in a league by yourself.  When your members turn out, you change hearts and minds.  You convince undecideds.  You move the needle.  In every single race, from the state house to the White House, your voice and your vote for working family candidates, will be among the most influential in America.You know unity.  You practice solidarity.  You are there every time America calls.  You are trusted.  You are reliable.  You get the job done.  That’s what working people do.  We do what it takes, no matter the cost.  We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night.  We don’t mind hard work.  We do it with pride.  We won’t be faced down or pushed around, and we will not be denied.Brothers and sisters, it’s time to get serious.  This is an unprecedented election.  There’s never been someone as unqualified, unfit, unprepared and unhinged as Donald Trump.  Electing Trump would be a national disaster and an international catastrophe.  America truly stands at a crossroads.  This isn’t about Democrats and Republicans or progressives and conservatives.  The 2016 presidential election is a choice between sanity and insanity.Donald Trump is dangerous for our country, for our communities and for our children.Trump has talked about shooting people multiple times.  That’s not a gaffe, not a misunderstanding.  It’s who he is. Trump said he could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody without losing any votes.  He said the “Second Amendment people” might have an answer for Hillary Clinton if she wins.  I won’t be coy.  He was talking about assassination.Trump advocated treason, actually suggesting that the Russians should commit espionage on American soil.  He said he would order our military personnel to commit war crimes.  He called President Obama the founder of ISIS.These are Trump’s words.  He’s not like Mitt Romney, who I disagreed with, but who I respect. He’s not like John McCain, who I campaigned against and yet admire as a great American.Donald Trump has misled millions of Americans into thinking he has the answers.  He doesn’t.Here’s all you need to know about the Donald.  He thinks our wages are too high, and he has stolen our pay time and time again.  He said outsourcing creates jobs.  He rooted for the housing collapse.  He supports right to work 100 percent.  And he thinks Carl Icahn—who just eliminated 3,000 union jobs at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City—would make a good Treasury Secretary.  It is no wonder that the credit rating firm Moody’s says Trump’s plans would cost our nation 3.5 million jobs.  That’s right.  Donald Trump would make America unemployed again.The good news is that working people have real solutions to real problems.  It’s called the Raising Wages agenda.  It starts with the absolute truth that each and every one of us should be decently paid for the work we do.  And we define what decent means!  It says no one should make less than the minimum wage, everyone should make a living wage, and collective bargaining should be available for all workers.  It covers everything we care about.  Fair trade.  Just immigration.  Equal pay for equal work.  And more.We have a champion for this agenda, and her name is Hillary Rodham Clinton.  Hillary is tough. She is smart.  She is prepared.  And she listens.  When she accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention, when she talked about “love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow,” it was clear she heard our call.  Hillary is the right candidate at the right time, poised to lead us away from the darkness of inequality and trickle down and toward the light of raising wages and shared prosperity.  Sisters and brothers, America is ready for Hillary Clinton.  And Hillary Clinton is ready to move America forward.  When working people talk, she listens.  I’ve seen her do it.  I’ve seen her take in our ideas and then put them to action.  It’s a wonderful thing to see.  She is running to change America, and we intend to help her do just that.Hillary is ready to rewrite the economic rules by reforming or killing corporate trade deals and saying no to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  She has an aggressive plan to rein in Wall Street, and she supports a tax on financial transactions so we can make massive investments in infrastruc-ture, public education, workforce development and manufacturing.  She will make the largest investment in jobs since World War II, and that’s exactly what America needs.  Moody’s, the same credit rating firm that gave Trump’s economic plan an F, gave Hillary Clinton an A+, because she will create over 10 million jobs!And finally, this is the icing on the cake, Hillary Clinton knows that the single greatest tool for economic mobility and a growing middle class is collective bargaining.

314,Trumka: Virginia is for Unions,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-virginia-unions,8-12-2016,"Good morning, brothers and sisters.  It is great to be here in Williamsburg.  Doris, thank you so much for that introduction.  I am proud to call you my sister.  Friends, let me just come out and say it: Doris Crouse-Mays is one on the finest trade unionists in the entire country.  She works hard.  She fights hard.  She’s there for us in good times and in bad.  Doris is proof positive that good things happen when you elect a pro-worker, progressive woman as your president. Take note, America.I know Doris will agree with me—she is privileged to lead a strong and powerful labor movement here in Virginia.I see it with my very eyes.  I feel it in this room.  Working people are on the rise, from Williamsburg to Virginia Beach, from Richmond to Fairfax.For a long time, conventional wisdom told us Virginia was a conservative stronghold.  Home to Liberty University, the National Right to Work Foundation and Ken Cuccinelli.A place where unions were few and far between and progress was nowhere to be found.But something changed here in Virginia, brothers and sisters.  And we helped change it.Let me talk a little bit about what Virginia looks like today.Verizon workers across Virginia, fed up with cutbacks and the threat of outsourcing, went out on strike.  For six weeks, CWA members and IBEW members stood strong.  And we stood with them.  In the end, workers won a new contract with substantial raises and enhanced job security. Workers at Kroger were rightly insulted by a contract that offered a 25 cent raise and one personal day that couldn’t be used until 2019.  Meanwhile, the CEO of Kroger had just gotten a 17 percent pay increase—to $11.2 million a year.  So UFCW members took the lead.  They taped quarters to their name badges to call attention to the company’s outrageous proposal.  They authorized a strike.  Guess what?  In the end, Kroger workers won a new contract that included higher pay, more personal days and retirement security.And we’re not done with Kroger yet.  We will not rest until workers at Kroger’s emerging marketplace stores have a voice on the job and a seat at the bargaining table.These victories are just the tip of the iceberg.The Steelworkers won an organizing campaign at Nestle in Danville and negotiations on a first contract are underway.The Machinists organized shipyard engineers right down the road in Newport News.The UFCW won its battle against Giant, saving 8 union grocery stores in the process.BCTGM members in Richmond are standing up to multinational conglomerate Mondelez.The APWU used a boycott of Staples to highlight the importance of protecting local post offices.  And AFGE is fighting to give TSA agents better pay and benefits.You see, in every corner of Virginia workers are experiencing the power of collective bargaining and collective action.  It’s a beautiful sight to see.They say Virginia is for lovers.  But I’d like to make an amendment.  Virginia is for unions!The union vision will lift us all up.  We can do it, because we’re the ones who drive the buses and run the trains.  We build the bridges and lift the loads.  We teach the classes and care for the sick.  We clean the schools.  We build America and defend it.  We do America’s work.  We make America go.  We want our share of the American Dream, brothers and sisters, and we’ll stand for it.  We’ll march for it.  And we’ll win it!Obviously, I couldn’t come here today without talking about politics.This year, working people are leading the national debate.  We’ve put the focus on good jobs with strong and growing wages.  We’ve made clear that workers should be sharing in the wealth we help create.  We’ve shifted the conversation on trade.  Instead of continuing to get run over by corporate trade deals, we’re leading the fight to write new global rules that lift up our families and communities.I want to thank each of you for your ongoing work to defeat the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Two years ago, almost nobody thought these corporate trade deals could be stopped.  But the entire labor movement stood together and slammed the brakes on the TPP.  As you know, some of our friends voted against us.  And now they are asking for our endorsement. The decision of whether or not to endorse is yours and yours alone.  I can report to you that the overwhelming majority of your brothers and sisters in other states have declined to endorse any candidate that voted in favor of fast track and has not yet declared their opposition to the TPP. As I said, the decision is yours.  But I personally believe our agenda should drive our politics, not the other way around.  No matter what you decide, I am confident that we will leave this convention strong, united and ready to kill the TPP once and for all!I recently returned from the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.  It was a truly inspiring week.  Democrats nominated a ticket that opposes the TPP, is committed to raising wages for working families and understands that when workers are strong, America is strong.I’ll have more to say about the Democrats in a bit, but I can’t let another moment pass without addressing the orange-haired elephant in the room.From the beginning, I said Donald Trump was unfit to serve as president of the United States.  In the last two weeks, he has left no doubt.Where do I start?  First, he dishonored the memory of a fallen soldier by criticizing a Gold Star family.  Then, he said he always wanted a Purple Heart, as if a military award is something that can be bought or sold without service or sacrifice.  Can you believe this guy, Doris?How great was my friend Will Fischer, by the way?  I hope you got the chance to see his video about what it means to get a Purple Heart.  It is really powerful stuff.Now if insulting America’s military heroes wasn’t enough, Trump suggested the best way for working women to deal with sexual harassment is either to “be strong” or find another job.And on Monday, he joked about killing his opponent.  Inciting violence is dangerous.  But coming from a presidential candidate, it’s disqualifying.Sisters and brothers, these moments reveal Donald Trump for who he truly is, not only as a candidate, but as a man.  Make no mistake, we can never, ever, ever let him get anywhere near the White House.Donald Trump is not only dangerous.  He’s dishonest.  He pretends to love our cause.  But he’s a fraud.If you took the words “me, myself and I” out of Trump’s vocabulary, he’d be speechless.Even if you overlook Trump’s racism, sexism and other disgraceful behavior, you’d still have a con man who spent decades shipping our jobs overseas, failing to pay us for the work we do, devastating our communities and treating us like second-class citizens.  And now Donnie-come-lately wants a spot on our bandwagon?Here’s all you need to know about the Donald.  He thinks our wages are too high, and he has stolen our pay time and time again.  He said outsourcing creates jobs.  He rooted for the housing collapse.  He supports right to work 100 percent.  And he thinks Carl Icahn—who just eliminated 3,000 union jobs at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City—would make a good Treasury Secretary.  It is no wonder that the credit rating firm Moody’s says Trump’s plans would cost our nation 3.5 million jobs.  That’s right.  Donald Trump would make America unemployed again.Since day one, Trump has disrespected President Obama.  But he sucks up to dictators like Russian President Vladimir Putin.  He praises terrorists like Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi.  Trump can’t control himself on his own Twitter feed, so can America really trust him as commander-in-chief?The answer is no.  Not now.  Not ever.  That’s why on November 8, 2016, working people are going to send Donald Trump this simple message: you’re fired.Thankfully, the Democratic side has been a much different story.  The primary contest between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton moved America in the right direction.  The Democratic platform yielded the strongest and most unifying vision in 50 years.  And Hillary Clinton is rising to meet the challenges of tomorrow with a strong agenda of shared prosperity.And I am thrilled that she chose Tim Kaine as her running mate.  We’ve had a relationship with Tim here in Virginia for 20 years.  He fought to pass a living wage as mayor of Richmond.  As Governor and now Senator, he has always given labor a seat at the table—even appointing former Virginia AFL-CIO President Danny LeBlanc to his cabinet.  While Republican Vice Presidential nominee Mike Pence was repealing his state’s prevailing wage law, Tim was working with us to invest in infrastructure and education and new technology.  And in a phone call last week, he told the AFL-CIO that he would proudly campaign against the right to work ballot initiative here in Virginia.Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine will move America forward.  They share our vision and our values.  In the end, they are running to change America, not just manage it.  And we intend to help them do just that.This is our moment.  To bring out the best in America.  To bring out the best in ourselves, and each other.  We’ve come too far to be turned back now.  We won’t back down.  We won’t back up.  We’ll stand tall.  We’ll march.  We’ll fight.  We’ll vote.  And we’ll win! Let me tell you something: This year, America’s labor movement is unleashing the most comprehensive electoral program in our history.And it all starts in Virginia.We’re going to defeat the misguided, petty and unnecessary right to work ballot initiative here. This amendment is a distraction from real issues like raising wages, creating good jobs and rebuilding the middle class.  And the constitution should be a place where we expand rights, not take them away.In 2008, Virginia helped elect the first black president of the United States.  And hasn’t Barack Obama done a wonderful job?  In 2016, this state is going to make history again by electing Hillary Clinton the first woman president.  And we’re going to send Virginia’s own Tim Kaine to follow in the footsteps of Joe Biden.We won’t stop there.  We are going to win a pro-worker U.S. Senate that will confirm a progressive Supreme Court majority.  And maybe, just maybe, we will win back the House of Representatives so our dear friend Bobby Scott can become a chairman, unless of course a better offer comes along.  Finally, we will continue to lay the groundwork at the state and local level here in Virginia.  That means winning school board seats and county commissions and electing state legislators who will work with Governor McAuliffe on workers’ rights and voting rights and civil rights.It’s time for us to stand up strong, brothers and sisters.  It’s time to mobilize and organize.  We’ll hit the worksites.  We’ll talk to members.  We’ll walk the streets and knock the doors.  This is what a unified labor movement does.  This is what it looks like when working people stand together, union strong!Last week, I welcomed my first grandchild into the world.  My son Rich and his wife had a beautiful baby boy.  Becoming a grandfather is a reminder that this movement is not just about us, it’s about building a stronger America for generations to come.It seems like yesterday I was in my backyard with Rich when he was just three or four years old. His grandfather had gotten him one of those battery operated jeeps.  He and his buddy Chad were driving around in the backyard.I was out there too—talking on the phone about what else—the union.  Rich must have overheard me because he drove up and said: “Dad what’s a union?”So I told him to try to push his jeep up the hill.  He strained and struggled and eventually got stuck.  Then I told his friend Chad to give him a hand.  Working together, they were able to do it.  I looked right at my son and said: “That’s a union.”Today, working people are climbing up our own hill.  Wages are still too low.  Benefits are still too few.  Retirement security isn’t secure enough.  And the economic rules remain skewed toward the wealthy few.But perhaps more than any moment before, I am confident we can reach the mountaintop. Because two is stronger than one.  And three is stronger than two.  And together is better than alone.So we’ll fix what’s broken in our country.  We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm in arm.  All day.  Every day.  Voting.  Fighting.  Winning.  Together.  To bring out the best in each other and ourselves.  To bring out the best in America.  To build the nation we can have and must have and will have!Thank you!  And God bless you!

315,Trumka to SMART Business Agents: You Can Make the Difference,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-smart-business-agents-you-can-make-difference,8-10-2016,"Thank you, Brother Joe [Sellers].  It’s great to be with all of you in Chicago.  Thank you for having me.Sisters and brothers, you and your members set the standard with your contracts, with your wages, your workplace safety, your pensions and your health care.  But that’s not news to you. Your theme is “Raising the Bar.”That’s what the American labor movement does when we use our solidarity and activism.When we raise the bar, the entire economy improves.  Wages go up.  Consumers have more money to spend.  Employers feel the competitive pressure to do better for their workers.  That’s the strength of collective bargaining and collective action.  We have the power to set off a race to the top.We raise the bar in politics, too.  When we get off the sidelines and onto the front lines, we build momentum for our issues and elect candidates who share our working family values.This year, working people are leading the national debate.  We’ve put the focus on good jobs with strong and growing wages.  We’ve made clear that working people should be sharing in the wealth we help create.  We’ve shifted the conversation on trade.  Instead of continuing to get run over by corporate trade deals, we’re leading the fight to write new global rules that lift up all working people.  All of this progress is a credit to our collective strength.  We’ve been able to make headway because our agenda is driving our politics, not the other way around.This year our agenda has influenced and inspired America’s leaders more than any time in the past 50 years.  That’s why I believe, more than ever, we need to throw everything we have into politics.  Working people are winning the debate.  Now it’s time to win the election.When you go back to your homes after this conference I want you to keep raising the bar.  Local and state elections need your energy.  National politicians get more attention, but people should know our working family candidates on the local level.  Those leaders can have tremendous impact on PLAs and local construction and other pocketbook issues for your members.  You can make the difference.  Working people need it.  The labor movement needs it.  Your family, neighbors and community need it.Listen, I know you’re involved.  I know you do your part.  But I’m asking you to raise that bar a little bit higher.  Keep pushing.  Keep fighting.  And whatever you do for the bottom of the ticket, do it for the top, too.In the races for the White House and for Congress, your voice and your vote will be among the most influential in America.We know unity.  We practice solidarity.  We’re going to show America what unionism is all about.  We’ll elect our union-backed candidates, and after this election we’ll use our strength to organize more working people and win better contracts.  We’ll get out on the picket line, and show America when we stand together we cannot be turned aside.From the worksite to the factory floor, we do it all.  We drive the trucks and carry the load and answer the call.  We do what it takes, no matter what the cost.  We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night.  We don’t mind hard work.  We do it with pride. We won’t be faced down or pushed around, and we will not be denied.The presidential election this year, and elections up and down the ticket, gives us a simple choice and an opportunity to win for working family candidates.  But it won’t be easy.Now I mentioned earlier how working people are driving the debate.  Nowhere has that been more evident than the presidential election.I just returned from the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.  It was a truly inspiring week.  Democrats nominated a ticket that opposes the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership, is committed to raising wages for working families and understands that when workers are strong, America is strong.I’ll have more to say about Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, but I just can’t let another moment pass without addressing the orange-haired elephant in the room.From the beginning, I said Donald Trump was unfit to serve as president of the United States. This past week, once again, he proved it.  Where do I start?  First, he dishonored the memory of a fallen soldier by criticizing a Gold Star family.  Then, he suggested the best way for working women to deal with sexual harassment is either to “be strong” or find another job.  Finally, he said he always wanted a Purple Heart, as if a military honor is something that can be bought or sold without service or sacrifice.  Sisters and brothers, the last few days revealed Donald Trump for who he truly is, not only as a candidate, but as a man.  Make no mistake, we cannot let him get anywhere near the White House.Trump is not only dangerous.  He’s dishonest.  He pretends to love our cause.  But he’s a fraud. He has no credibility.  He’ll say anything to get himself elected, but he’d never raise wages or create jobs because he cares about nobody and nothing but himself.If you took the words “me, myself and I” out of Trump’s vocabulary, he’d be speechless.You see, even if you take away Trump’s racism, sexism and anti-unionism, you’d still have a con man who spent decades shipping our jobs overseas, failing to pay us for the work we do, devastating our communities and treating us like second-class citizens.  And now Donnie-come-lately wants a spot on our bandwagon?  Give me a break.Here’s all you need to know about the Donald.  He thinks our wages are too high, and he has stolen our pay time and time again.  He said outsourcing creates jobs.  He rooted for the housing collapse.  He supports right to work 100 percent.  Trump would cut taxes for the superrich and roll back common sense Wall Street reforms.  The credit rating firm Moody’s says Trump’s plans would cost our nation 3.5 million jobs.  That’s right.  Donald Trump would make America unemployed again.Since day one, he has disrespected President Obama.  But Trump sucks up to dictators like Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Trump praises Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi. Trump can’t control himself on his own twitter feed, so can America trust him as commander-in-chief?The answer is no.  Not now.  Not ever.  That’s why on November 8, 2016, working people are going to kick Donald Trump in the ass.Thankfully, the Democratic side has been a much different story.  The primary contest between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton moved America in the right direction.  The Democratic platform yielded the strongest and most unifying vision in 50 years.  And Hillary Clinton is rising to meet the challenges of tomorrow with a strong vision of American prosperity.Moody’s, the same experts that gave Trump an F-minus on the economy, gives Hillary Clinton an A-plus.  Her comprehensive plan to invest in infrastructure, support manufacturing and help small businesses would create 10.5 million jobs!Hillary Clinton has a great plan, and she’ll get it done.  That’s what she does.As president, Hillary Clinton will move America forward.  When working people talk, she listens.  I’ve seen her do it.  I’ve seen her take in our ideas and then put them to action.  It’s a wonderful thing to see.  Hillary shares our vision and our values.  In the end, she is running to change America, not just manage it.  And we intend to help her do just that.This is how you rewrite the economic rules.  Our Raising Wages agenda makes it plain:Hillary Clinton will work with us to get it done!This is our moment.  To bring out the best in America.  To bring out the best in ourselves, and each other.  We’ve come too far to be turned back now.  We won’t back down.  We won’t back up.  We’ll stand tall.  We’ll march.  We’ll fight.  We’ll vote.  And we’ll win! Let me tell you something: This year, America’s labor movement is unleashing the most comprehensive electoral program in our history.Our strength grows from our unity.  It comes from our activism.  It’s up to us to motivate each other.  We need your help.  Talk to your members.  Ask them to volunteer and turn out at the polls.  I want to see union members vote like never before.  If you haven’t done it already, talk to your central labor council.  Name a coordinator for each worksite, so our team has someone to communicate with.When your membership gets involved in the ground campaign, nothing can stop us.  When working people speak the truth about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, we will move the needle.  The choice is clear.  You know what it takes.  Keep leading the way.  Keep blazing a trail forward. It’s time for us to stand up strong, brothers and sisters.  It’s time to mobilize and organize.  This electoral season is all about raising wages.  We’ll hit the worksites.  We’ll talk to members.  We’ll walk the streets and knock the doors.  This is what a unified labor movement does.  This is what it looks like when working people stand together, union strong!And after the ballots are counted and the elections have been won, we’ll be in a better position to organize in the workplace, and win strong contracts and better pay.We’ll fix what’s broken in our country.  Together, we will create a better tomorrow.  It won’t be easy.  We’ll have to work for it, sisters and brothers.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm in arm.  All day.  Every day.  Voting.  Fighting.  Winning.  Together.  To bring out the best in each other and ourselves.  To bring out the best in America.  To build the nation we can have and must have and will have!Thank you!  And God bless you!

316,Trumka to GMP Delegates: Our Agenda Drives Our Politics,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-gmp-delegates-our-agenda-drives-our-politics,8-8-2016,"Thank you, Brother Bruce [Smith].  Congratulations on your 75th quadrennial convention!  It’s great to be with all of you.Sisters and brothers, your union has a beautiful history, and a powerful future.  You work hard. You sacrifice.  You stand together.  You make our labor movement proud.I know you will soon vote on whether to merge with the United Steelworkers.  Let me just say this: I trust your judgment, your unionism and your solidarity.No matter what you decide, I’m confident you will leave this convention united and strong and ready to win a better future for all working people.That’s what GMP is all about.Whether you work with glass or plastics, fine china or insulation, you help set the standard on good wages, a safe workplace, retirement and health care. And the more you grow, the more you organize, the more industry-leading contracts you negotiate, the higher you can set the bar.I mean that literally.  It’s true in the workplace.  Your victories send signals and set targets far beyond your industries.  It’s also true in politics.  When we get off the sidelines and onto the front lines, we elect candidates who share our working family values.That’s the strength of collective bargaining and collective action.Our agenda drives our politics, not the other way around.  This year, more than ever, we have shaped the political conversation in America.  Good jobs and raising wages and strong unions are front and center, and we intend to keep them there.  Working people are winning the debate. Now it’s time to win the election.Your mobilization and your groundwork are absolutely critical.  Working people need it.  The labor movement needs it.  Your family, neighbors and community need it.You’ll change hearts and minds.  You’ll mobilize our members.  You’ll convince undecideds. You’ll persuade folks who like Trump’s style to think again.  You’ll communicate with your friends, coworkers and family.  Remember this: Conversations win elections.Listen, I know you’re involved.  I know you do your part.  I’m asking you to step it up a notch, maybe two or three notches.In every single race, from the state house to the White House, your voice and your vote will be among the most influential in America.We know unity.  We practice solidarity.  We’ll elect our union-backed candidates, and hold their feet to the fire when they take office.  And we’ll use our strength to organize more working people and win better contracts.  We’ll get out on the picket line, and show America when we stand together, we cannot be turned aside.From the building site to the factory floor, we do it all.  We build windows and overpasses.  We carry the load and answer the call.  We do what it takes, no matter what the cost.  We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night.  We don’t mind hard work.

317,Trumka Address to the 2016 Democratic National Convention,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-address-2016-democratic-national-convention,7-25-2016,"Hello Democrats! I’m Rich Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO.It’s great to be in Philadelphia—a proud union town! Working people built this stage. And together we are going to build a new era of shared prosperity.Working people are strong. And Donald Trump is wrong, wrong, wrong.Listen, he thinks he's a tough guy. Well, Mr. Trump, I worked in the mines with tough guys. I know tough guys, and they are friends of mine. And Donald, you’re no tough guy.Donald Trump has repeatedly outsourced American jobs to line his own pockets. He rooted for the housing collapse. He actually said that wages are “too high.”Donald Trump isn’t the solution to America’s problems. He is the problem.Working people—we have the solutions. We are building a national movement for a better life, no matter the color of our skin, where we were born, who we love, or how we worship.We set the bar high. And Hillary Clinton answered our call.In this election, she is fighting to rewrite the economic rules for all of us! She has a bold plan to invest in manufacturing, infrastructure and jobs. She opposes the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. She will protect workplace rights, stand up to Wall Street, and finally, finally secure equal pay for equal work!So get on your feet, Democrats. Let’s change the rules! Let’s take back Congress! Let’s win a pro-worker Supreme Court! And let’s elect Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States!© 2023 AFL-CIO.

318,Trumka to Washington AFL-CIO Delegates: You Draw Strength From the Ground Up,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-washington-afl-cio-delegates-you-draw-strength-ground,7-20-2016,"Thank you, Brother Jeff [Johnson].  Thank you, sisters and brothers.  I’m so proud to speak at your convention today.Washington offers the American labor movement an example of how much good can be done when you draw strength from the ground up.  Just look at Initiative 1433.  A rank and file union member, Ariana Davis of UFCW Local 21, is the citizen petitioner who is fighting to guarantee all workers in Washington a living wage and seven paid sick days.  You led the country with the highest minimum wage for close to 20 years and with this initiative you can get out in front again and set the pace.But we don’t only fight for wages at the ballot box.  I know state employees in Washington are in the process of negotiating a contract with the governor’s office.  This is a big deal.  You should get real wage increases.  State workers could be making more money in the private sector, but you chose public service.  That’s powerful, and the entire AFL-CIO stands with you as you negotiate to win fair wages and good benefits.You see, the best way to build a ladder to the middle class is with a union contract.  It’s the single greatest tool to raise pay and win good benefits and a secure retirement.That’s why it’s so important that the King County Labor Council and Teamsters 117 are fighting to protect the rights of drivers.  You want workers at Uber and Lyft to have the freedom to form an association and negotiate together for a better life.  Legal challenges remain, but our position is clear: all employees should have the right to bargain collectively, including the growing on-demand workforce.  This is about a labor movement that touches more workers, and lifts up more lives.What we’re talking about is good jobs, democracy at work and corporate accountability.  These should not be partisan issues.Anybody who calls themselves a conservative should embrace these ideas, and the idea that public money should be used to encourage good-paying jobs here in Washington.I’m talking specifically about how Boeing executives act as if they have the right to take taxpayer money and run.  They don’t.  The public has supported Boeing, because Boeing machinists and engineers play a huge role in the state and regional economy.  Make no mistake: Boeing workers make it one of the most powerful and profitable corporations in the world.  For greedy CEOs to pocket state tax incentives and then kill good Washington jobs, after the sacrifices you and your union members made, it’s just shameful.  It’s wrong.We need to elect leaders who will make sure this never happens again.  Tax incentives must come with strong claw-back provisions.  Again, that’s something all of us should agree on: Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody.You see, working people drive the economy in Washington.  Working people need to come first. That’s the secret to a successful economy, but it’s really no secret at all.It all comes back to one absolute truth: That each and every one of us should be decently paid for the work we do.  That means having the right to join together and negotiate for better wages and benefits, a reasonable work schedule and a voice on the job.  We know that being part of a union is the surest way to get better wages, equal pay, health care, sick days and vacation time.  When we stand together, we’re stronger.  But this is about more than dollars and cents: it’s about a better life, for all working people, no matter who you love or how you worship, no matter where you came from or what you do.  Our agenda is as big as it is bold.  Fair trade.  Health care.  Equal pay for equal work.  Decent pensions and a quality public education for every single child.  Justice for immigrants and yes, #BlackLivesMatter.Our vision can unite America.  Washington is hungry for it.  America is hungry for it.  We can do it, because we’re the ones who drive the buses and run the trains.  We build the bridges and lift the loads.  We teach the classes and care for the sick.  We clean the schools.  We clear the roads and load the trucks.  We build America and defend it.  We do America’s work.  We make America go.  We want our share of the American Dream, brothers and sisters, and we’ll stand for it.  We’ll march for it.  And we’ll win it!Today, in the beautiful city of Cleveland, Ohio, an ugly spectacle is taking place.  I’m talking about the Republican National Convention, but it’s not ugly because it’s a function of the Republican Party.  It’s ugly because many of today’s Republican leaders—foremost among them Donald Trump—are selfish, divisive, often racist and always mean-spirited.The 2016 presidential election isn’t about left versus right or even Democrat versus Republican. It’s bigger than that.  This year, we’re going to find out what we are made of as a country.  Are we small-minded, mean and weak?  Or are we ambitious, courageous and strong?The answer is right here in Washington.  We see the challenges, and we rise above them.  We stand together.  We find common ground.  And when we get to work, we create abundance. That’s America.And then there is Donald Trump.  But before I talk about his lies, his hypocrisy and his fraudulence, I want to remind you how we got here.Ever since Barack Obama was elected President, the Republican vocabulary has been reduced to one word: “No!” No to creating jobs.  No to raising wages.  No to investing in roads and bridges.  No to fairness for immigrants.  No to racial justice.  No to unions.  No to a new direction on trade.  No to a vote on the President’s Supreme Court nominee.
In their obsession with defeating and defying President Obama, Republican leaders have undermined the strength of America and prevented us from making desperately needed progress.People are fed up.  And we should be!  By refusing to govern, Republican leaders have abandoned their responsibility and left all working people behind.  And Donald Trump threatens to fill the void.Through his actions, his words and his ideas, Trump is profoundly unfit to be president.  And it’s not just me saying that.  It’s Republican leaders, too.  It’s Mitt Romney.  It’s George W. Bush.  Look how many Republicans aren’t at the convention this week. Seventy percent of Americans view Trump unfavorably.  Is it any wonder?  Name any core American value, and Donald Trump is against it.  Freedom of religion.  Freedom of the press. Responsibility.  Equality.  Unity.  Integrity.  He stands against everything we stand for!Listen to this: Trump thinks our wages are too high.  Really, he said that.Trump spent over half a million dollars trying to prevent employees at his hotel in Las Vegas from organizing.  Workers won the election anyway, and now he is refusing to bargain a fair contract.  How exactly does that make America great?Trump actually rooted for the collapse of the housing and real estate market.  He bet on himself and against America. People lost their homes, their jobs and their life savings.  And Donald Trump was cheering all the way to the bank.If there was any doubt Trump detests working people, just look who he chose as a running mate.  Mike Pence repealed Indiana’s prevailing wage law.  Carrier decided to move 1,400 good union jobs to Mexico on his watch.  And Pence is an unabashed supporter of right to work.Sisters and brothers, Donald Trump made himself rich by making the rest of us poor, and we are going to kick his ass in November.You see, in the last few years, something has started to change in America.  Working people have come alive.  We have said “enough.”  Enough to an economy designed to keep us down, lower our pay and damage our families and communities.We’re ready to create a new economy where we set the terms and Wall Street and the wealthy elite follow the rules.A year ago we made it clear that candidates must offer a bold and comprehensive raising wages agenda if they wanted to appeal to working people.  Hillary Clinton did exactly that.  She and Bernie Sanders had a substantive, passionate campaign that forever changed where the economic debate starts in America.  It was one of the best primary contests I’ve ever seen.  Bernie now stands with Hillary and so does the AFL-CIO.Hillary Clinton is a pro-worker progressive who has always fought to make life better for working people, families and children.  She is tough.  She is smart.  And she understands that to truly make America great, unions must lead the way.When you think about it, the labor movement shares a lot in common with Hillary.  Both of us have endured right-wing attacks for the better part of three decades.  Both of us have been knocked down and counted out.  And despite these obstacles, both of us have gotten back up time and time again.The choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, well, it’s not a choice at all.Just look at the trade issue.  No one has fought harder or smarter against the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership than the people in this room.  Here in Washington, we had to take on a Democratic president, two Democratic senators, and a handful of Democratic members of Congress.  But we did it.  Because our agenda drives our politics, not the other way around.We changed the debate by focusing on trade rules, the structures that for too long have killed jobs and lowered wages.  Two years ago, almost nobody thought these corporate trade deals could be stopped.  Well something happened along the way.  A groundswell of activism led by each of you slammed the brakes on the whole process.  Our strength stunned the political establishment.Because of your work, Congress does not have the votes to pass the TPP.Because of your work, the Democratic Party just officially adopted the strongest pro-worker trade position in history.And because of your work, Hillary Clinton not only opposes the TPP, she has called for an entirely new direction on trade.You did that!  Give yourselves a hand.And what about Donald Trump?  Trump talks a good game on trade, but his first and only loyalty is to himself.  Trump embodies everything that is wrong with our current trade policies.  He personally profited from NAFTA.  He told students at Trump University that outsourcing creates jobs.  And he has consistently sent American jobs overseas to line his own pockets. When it comes to fair trade, Donald Trump is nothing more than a con-man, a cheapskate and a fraud.Sisters and brothers, the choice is clear.  Hillary Clinton is our champion and we are going to elect her the next president of the United States!  Washington will show us the way!  And we’ll elect a Congress to work with her.  We’ll rewrite the economic rules and create a new era of shared prosperity!Yet listen, we understand an election is a beginning, not an end.  We will hold every one of our elected leaders accountable, from the statehouse to the White House.You see, our economy is not like the weather.  It doesn’t just happen to us.  No drought dried up our pensions.  Greedy corporations drove down our wages.  Ruthless CEOs and anti-worker politicians stole our pensions.  Billionaires like Trump sold our jobs overseas, because our trade deals and tax policies encouraged him to.  What we do in Washington this year has the potential to transform our entire economy.  It’s about having an equal shot and a fair shake.  We’ll keep fighting.  Keep marching.  Keep building.  To win a new era of good jobs, strong unions and raising wages.Here in Washington, and across this country, America’s labor movement is unleashing the most comprehensive electoral program in our history.You got a head start with your organizing to put Initiative 1433 on the ballot.  In particular, I’m really proud of the way UFCW Locals 21 and 367 stepped up.  I also want to congratulate the Washington Public Employees Association, SEIU 1199 Northwest and Teamsters Locals 117 and 38.  It is clear to me that all of your members are passionate about social justice and raising wages.  Don’t dial it back.  You’ve got to keep the momentum, and turn your energy toward your labor-to-neighbor political education.  That’s how we win elections.If you live in a district with a competitive state senate seat, double your efforts.  Think of the progress we can make with leaders who share our values.And while I’m at it, every Washington resident here should have your primary ballots by now. So find that ballot.  If you haven’t done so already, fill it out!  Mail it in!  And if you have questions about the candidates, look in your packet or reach out to your CLC.  We won’t tell you who to vote for, but we will give you a list of endorsed candidates, and you can decide for yourself.Our strength grows from our unity.  Keep leading the way.  Keep blazing a trail forward.  As a national movement, we’ve been under attack so long, it can be hard to get out of a defensive crouch.  But Washington has always shown us how to be proactive.So it’s time to stand up strong, brothers and sisters.  It’s time to mobilize and organize.  This electoral season is all about raising wages.  We’ll hit the worksites.  We’ll talk to members.  We’ll walk the streets and knock the doors.  This is what a unified labor movement does.  This is what it looks like when working people stand together, union strong!We’ll fix what’s broken in our country.  We’ll heal through solidarity.  Together, we will create a better tomorrow.  It won’t be easy.  It won’t happen in an instance or through one election.   We’ll have to work for it, sisters and brothers.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.  Shoulder to shoulder. Arm in arm.  All day.  Every day.  Voting.  Fighting.  Winning.  Together.  To bring out the best in each other and ourselves.  To bring out the best in America.  To build the nation we can have and must have and will have!Thank you!  And God bless you!

319,Trumka to Boilermakers Convention: Your Values Are In Exactly the Right Place ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-boilermakers-convention-your-values-are-exactly-right-place,7-19-2016,"Thank you, Brother Newt [Jones].  I appreciate you and your union tremendously.  Solidarity and a commitment to America’s middle class are front and center for the Boilermakers.  Thank you for bringing me to Vegas to speak to your convention.  Your union is strong and has a powerful future, because your values are in exactly the right place.I particularly want to acknowledge the Boilermakers’ vision and activism when it comes to the responsible stewardship of union financial resources.  I’m talking about your leadership with the Bank of Labor.Sometimes I run across people who don’t understand why the labor movement needs a bank, or why we should use our assets to be active corporate shareholders, to make our voices heard on Wall Street.Here’s how I explain it: Money is just like anything else.  It can be organized as a tool for us, or a weapon against us.  When we don’t use it as a tool, our opponents use our own dollars to beat us down, our own money.  Think about that.Well, for nearly a century, the Bank of Labor has organized the financial resources of working families for working families.  Now, with the leadership of the Boilermakers, we have taken that small bank to a much larger platform.  It is primed for major growth, and as it expands, so will the fortunes of working people.Brothers and sisters, thanks to the leadership of the Boilermakers, we can earn solid returns, create union jobs, strengthen pensions and expand the middle class.That is our vision.  It grows from our values, and what we need to live a good life.And our agenda drives our politics, not the other way around.  America’s labor movement doesn’t work for any party or candidate.  We work for working people, period.  Yes, we will stand with candidates who stand with us, but we will never stop holding them accountable, we will never put the interests of any candidate, or any party, above our own.When we mobilize around our issues, we build power.  Just look at how raising wages has grown as an issue this election season.  Together, working people have changed the debate.  We’re no longer just talking about jobs.  We’re talking about good, union jobs that allow you to support yourself and your family.That’s not all.  Look at trade.  For years, the Wall Street and Washington elite have tried to paint us as against trade.  We’re not.  This isn’t a yes or no question.  It’s about the kind of trade we want.  Show us a trade deal that raises wages and standards, and we’ll be the first to support it. But what we won’t do, what we refuse to do, is allow another corporate trade deal to be shoved down our throats.  That’s why with your help, the labor movement kicked the Trans-Pacific Partnership to the curb.  That’s not all.  Because of our leadership, the Democratic Party recently adopted the most pro-worker trade language in its history.  And if elected, Hillary Clinton has promised no TPP and an entirely new direction on trade.We have seized the momentum.  Good wages and quality jobs are mainstream ideas in America today, and that’s why our labor movement is popular.  That’s also why our popularity is growing among young workers, women and people of color.  We’ve expanded the scope of what our labor movement fights for, and we’re expanding our democracy by registering and empowering hundreds of thousands of new voters.All of this and more is why we are poised to turn our vision into action.Our vision starts with the absolute truth that each and every one of us should be decently paid for the work we do.  And we define what decent means! That means having the right to join together and negotiate for better wages and benefits, a reasonable work schedule and a voice on the job.  We know that being part of a union is the surest way to get better wages, equal pay, health care, sick days and vacation time.  When we stand together, we’re stronger.  But this is about more than dollars and cents: it’s about a better life, for all working people, no matter who you love or how you worship, no matter the color of your skin or where you were born.  Our vision will unite this country and build a better future.  America is hungry for it.  We can do it, because we’re the ones who light the fires and run the trains.  We build the bridges and light the fires.  We teach the classes, clean the schools, clear the roads and load the trucks.  We do America’s work.  We make America go.  And we want our share of the American Dream, brothers and sisters.  So let’s stand for it, let’s march for it and let’s win it!Listen, in the midst of a major electoral season, we can never lose sight of the needs and priorities of our members, and of America’s working families.  That means maintaining a strong focus on winning good contracts, organizing new members and pursuing policies that improve our lives.Let me give you an example, like the fact that America will need baseload power from coal-fired plants for the foreseeable future.  Even the Department of Energy predicts that we will have coal generation for decades to come. We know carbon capture, use and storage is necessary to reduce global emissions.  The truth is, developing countries around the world are building coal-fired power plants as fast as possible. We can address climate change and be an international energy leader by investing in and developing clean emissions technology.  It exists.  Let’s make it work for us.The same goes for nuclear power.  We need to save what we have and build more.  We can’t meet our climate goals without nuclear power, and that’s not an opinion, it’s simple math.  There is a right way to clean up the environment and a wrong way, and the right way is by picking technologies that create high-paying jobs for crafts like the Boilermakers, and workers everywhere.You see, this isn’t a Democratic or Republican concept.  It’s simply an idea that makes sense, regardless of your politics.Now I respect the fact that you have not endorsed a candidate for president, but I also know Boilermakers across the country are engaging in the electoral process.Today, in the beautiful city of Cleveland, Ohio, an ugly spectacle is taking place.  I’m talking about the Republican National Convention.  But it’s not ugly because it’s a function of the Republican Party.  It’s ugly because many of today’s Republican leaders—foremost among them Donald Trump—are selfish, divisive, often racist and always mean-spirited.  Republicans have a strong tradition of working with unions.  It was two Republicans, James Davis and Robert Bacon, who came together to pass the national prevailing wage law that bears their name.  We will happily work with any politician who will work with us.  The doors of the labor movement are always open.But make no mistake, Donald Trump is a liar, a hypocrite and a fraud.Through his actions, his words and his ideas, Donald Trump is profoundly unfit to be president. And it’s not just me saying that.  It’s Republican leaders, too.  It’s Mitt Romney.  It’s George W. Bush.  Look how many Republicans aren’t at the convention this week.Seventy percent of Americans view Trump unfavorably.  Is it any wonder?  Name any core American value, and Donald Trump is against it.  Freedom of religion.  Freedom of the press. Responsibility.  Equality.  Unity.  Integrity.  He stands against everything we stand for!Listen to this: Trump thinks our wages are too high.  Really, he said that. He spent over half a million dollars trying to prevent employees at his hotel here in Las Vegas from organizing.  Workers won the election anyway, and now he is refusing to bargain a fair contract.  Workers at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City are on strike as we speak.  How exactly does denying workers good wages and benefits make America great?Trump talks a good game on trade but he ships jobs overseas every chance he gets, and he manufactures his products in countries with low wages and nonexistent labor protections.  He personally profited from NAFTA and said that outsourcing creates jobs. If there was any doubt Trump detests working people, just look who he chose as a running mate.  Mike Pence repealed Indiana’s prevailing wage law.  Carrier decided to move 1,400 good union jobs to Mexico on his watch.  And Pence is an unabashed supporter of right to work.Sisters and brothers, Donald Trump made himself rich by making the rest of us poor, and we are going to kick his ass in November.In the end, the 2016 presidential election isn’t about left versus right or even Democrat versus Republican.  It’s bigger than that.  We’re going to find out what we are made of as a country. Are we small-minded, mean and weak?  Or are we ambitious, responsible, courageous and strong?In the last few years, something has started to change in America.  Working people have come alive.  We have said “enough.”  Enough to an economy designed to keep us down, lower our pay and damage our families and communities.We made it clear that any candidate who wanted our support must offer a bold and comprehen-sive raising wages agenda.  Hillary Clinton did exactly that.  She earned the AFL-CIO’s endorsement and more than that, she won our respect.Hillary Clinton is a pro-worker progressive who has always fought to make life better for working people, families and children.  Time and again, Hillary has gotten the job done.  She is tough.  She is smart.  And she understands that to truly make America great, unions must lead the way.Hillary knows that our economy is not like the weather.  It doesn’t just happen to us.  No drought dried up our pensions.  No summer storm blew away our good pay.  Greedy corporations drove down our wages.  Ruthless CEOs and anti-worker politicians stole our pensions.  Billionaires like Donald Trump sold our jobs overseas, because our trade deals and tax policies encouraged him to. What we do in this election cycle has the potential to transform our entire economy.  It’s about workers having an equal shot and a fair shake.  We’ll keep fighting.  Keep marching.  Keep building.  To win a new era of good jobs, strong unions and raising wages.Let me tell you something: This year, America’s labor movement is unleashing the most comprehensive electoral program in our history.Our strength grows from our unity.  It comes from our activism.  It’s up to us to motivate each other.  As the leaders of the Boilermakers, it’s on you to move your members to volunteer and turn out at unprecedented levels.Keep leading the way.  Keep blazing a trail forward.  As a national movement, we’ve been under attack so long, it can be hard to get out of a defensive crouch.   So it’s time for us to stand up strong, brothers and sisters.  It’s time to mobilize and organize.  This electoral season is all about raising wages.  We’ll hit the worksites.  We’ll talk to members.  We’ll walk the streets and knock the doors.  This is what a unified labor movement does.  This is what it looks like when working people stand together, union strong!And after the ballots are counted and the election has been won, we’ll be in a better position to organize in the workplace, and win strong contracts and better pay.We’ll fix what’s broken in our country.  We’ll heal through solidarity.  Together, we will create a better tomorrow.  It won’t be easy.  It won’t happen in an instance or through one election.  We’ll have to work for it, sisters and brothers.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.  Shoulder to shoulder. Arm in arm.  All day.  Every day.  Voting.  Fighting.  Winning.  Together.  To bring out the best in each other and ourselves.  To bring out the best in America.

320,"Trumka: California ""A View of the Future"" ",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-california-view-future,7-13-2016,"Thank you, Brother Art [Pulaski].  Thank you, brothers and sisters.  I’m so proud to speak at your convention today.
As I start, I want to say a word about the difficult events of last week. Our hearts are heavy. Heavy for the loss of life. Heavy for the way these tragedies divide us. Heavy for all those who fear for their own safety—whether they are a police officer or someone who comes into contact with the police.But I am also hopeful. Hopeful because the Dallas police were protecting the right of protestors to make their voices heard. Hopeful because in the midst of division and chaos, there exists the seeds of a real dialogue. Hopeful because we have a genuine belief that all of us are brothers and sisters.The labor movement is committed to doing our part. We are determined to get this right. For working people of all races and backgrounds and the country we love.Let’s honor the memories of those killed by coming together to build an America where we are all free and safe and valued.I know you are committed to doing that here in California. You offer the rest of America a view of the future.  But to move forward the right way, I think it’s important to first look back.How many of you remember Proposition 187?  It was a hateful referendum designed to prevent immigrant workers from building a better life.  It was as wrong then as it is today.  At the time, California was basically a purple state, split equally between Democrats and Republicans.But Prop 187 was a turning point.  And Governor Pete Wilson’s disgraceful ad depicting an immigrant invasion was the last straw.Working people took California back, and today it is one of the most progressive, pro-worker states in the country.Californians chose hope over fear, love over hate and unity over division.  We continue to do that today.  And we are all better for it.Except now we have Donald Trump.  He might be new to the American political scene, but his playbook of using immigration to distract and divide us is old and tired.  We rejected the politics of xenophobia long ago and that’s why the Republican Party in California is on life support, hardly able to produce decent candidates for the general election.When Trump says “Make America Great Again,” what he really means is take America back to a time when immigrants were in the shadows, women were in the kitchen, LGBTQ people were in the closet, and only white men were in the White House.Sisters and brothers, America goes forward, not back!Our unions are following a vision that grows from our values, and the reality of what we need to live a good life, in California and across America.  Our vision is why we support an expansive progressive political and legislative agenda that will improve the lives of California’s working families.  That’s our mission.And we can never forget that our agenda drives our politics, not the other way around.  So when Democrats like Congressman Ami Bera forget who put them into office, they can forget about having our help.  We stand with those who stand with us, no matter what political party you belong to.That’s what makes us strong.  We work for working people, not Democrats or Republicans.  And we’ll make sure they never forget it!Your strength, the strength of California’s labor movement, is no accident.You set the benchmark for success.  It starts with strategic planning.  You lead the way when it comes to the crucial issue of federation accountability.  You know how to get buy-in.  That’s the secret to your success, but it’s really no secret at all.  Our strength rises up from below.  Our power comes from our relationships.  And when we build like you’re building, we win real progress: Paid family leave, a $15 minimum wage, protections for immigrant workers and so many other victories.It all comes back to one absolute truth: That each and every one of us should be decently paid for the work we do.  That means having the right to join together and negotiate for better wages and benefits, a reasonable work schedule and a voice on the job.  We know that being part of a union is the surest way to get better wages, equal pay, health care, sick days and vacation time.  When we stand together, we’re stronger.  But this is about more than dollars and cents: it’s about a better life, for all working people, no matter who you love or how you worship, no matter where you came from or what you do.  It covers everything we care about.  Fair trade.  Health care.  Equal pay for equal work.  Decent pensions and a quality public education for every single child.  Justice for immigrants and yes, #BlackLivesMatter.Our vision will unite this country and build a better future.  California is hungry for it.  America is hungry for it.  We can do it, because we’re the ones who drive the buses and run the trains.  We build the bridges and lift the loads.  We teach the classes and care for the sick.  We clean the schools.  We clear the roads and load the trucks.  We build America and defend it.  We do America’s work.  We make America go.  We want our share of the American Dream, brothers and sisters, and we’ll stand for it.  We’ll march for it.  And we’ll win it!We are in the midst of an incredibly important election year.  But this is much more than the typical political horse race.  In 2016, we’re going to find out what we are made of as a country. Are we small-minded and weak?  Or are we ambitious and strong?The answer is right here in California.  We see the challenges, and we rise above them.  We stand together.  We find common ground.  And when we get to work, we create abundance. That’s America.And then there is Donald Trump.  But before I talk about his lies, his hypocrisy and his fraudulence, I want to remind you how we got here.Republican extremism created Donald Trump.  He is the manifestation of years of low-road politics, racism and division.Ever since Barack Obama was elected President, the Republican vocabulary has been reduced to one word: “No!”  It’s like being the parent of a four-year-old.No to creating jobs.  No to raising wages.  No to investing in roads and bridges.  No to deferred action for immigrants.  No to justice.  No to unions.  No to a new direction on trade.  No to a vote on the President’s Supreme Court nominee.In their obsession with defeating and defying President Obama, Republican leaders refused to work with him, so we haven’t been able to make the big changes working people need, that America needs.People are fed up.  And we should be!  Washington is broken!  By refusing to govern, Republican leaders have left working people behind.  By refusing to govern, Republican leaders paved the way for a monster.  That monster is Donald Trump.Through his actions, his words and his ideas, Donald Trump is profoundly unfit to be president. And it’s not just me saying that.  It’s Republican leaders, too.  It’s Mitt Romney.  It’s George W. Bush.  Look how many Republican leaders aren’t going to next week’s convention.  And how about the VP search?  It feels like a search and rescue operation.Seventy percent of Americans view Trump unfavorably.  Is it any wonder?  Name any core American value, and Donald Trump is against it.  Freedom of religion.  Freedom of the press. Responsibility.  Equality.  Unity.  Integrity.  He stands against everything we stand for!Listen to this: Trump spent over half a million dollars trying to prevent employees at his hotel in Las Vegas from organizing.  Workers won the election anyway, and now he is refusing to bargain a fair contract.  How exactly does that make America great?Trump talks a good game on trade but he ships jobs overseas every chance he gets, and manufactures his products in countries with low wages and nonexistent labor protections.  He personally profited from NAFTA and said that outsourcing creates jobs.  When it comes to fair trade, Donald Trump is nothing more than con-man, a cheapskate and a fraud.Trump actually rooted for the collapse of the housing and real estate market.  He bet on himself and against America. People lost their homes, their jobs and their life savings.  And Donald Trump was cheering all the way to the bank.We recently learned that since 2005, Trump’s companies have been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act for stealing wages from his workers.Trump says he sets the gold standard.  It’s more like the lead standard, and it would sink every working family in this country.Sisters and brothers, Donald Trump made himself rich by making the rest of us poor and we are going to kick his ass in November.You see, in the last few years, something has started to change in America.  Working people have come alive.  We have said “enough.”  Enough to an economy that is designed to keep us down, lower our wages and hurt our families and communities.We’re ready to write new rules for a new economy where working people set the terms and the Wall Street and wealthy elite abide by them.A year ago we made it clear that candidates must offer a bold and comprehensive raising wages agenda if they wanted to appeal to working people.  Hillary Clinton did exactly that.  She and Bernie Sanders had a substantive, passionate campaign that forever changed where the economic debate starts in America.  It was one of the best primary contests I’ve ever seen.  In the end, Hillary Clinton won the most votes, the most delegates and the support of most unions.  The AFL-CIO is proud to endorse her.Hillary Clinton is a pro-worker progressive who has always fought to make life better for working people, families and children.  Time and again, Hillary has listened to us and stood with us to win positive change. She is tough.  She is smart.  And she understands that to truly make America great, unions must lead the way.When you think about it, the labor movement shares a lot in common with Hillary.  Both of us have endured right-wing attacks for the better part of three decades.  Both of us have been knocked down and counted out.  And despite these obstacles, both of us have gotten back up time and time again.The choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, well, it’s not a choice at all.Hillary supports a fundamental new direction on trade. Just yesterday, she said and I quote: “We’re going to say no to bad trade deals and unfair trade practices, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership.” And not only that, because of our leadership, the Democratic Party recently adopted the most pro-worker trade language in its history.Trump, on the other hand, embodies everything that is wrong with the current trade model.Hillary supports equal pay for equal work.  Trump said letting women have jobs is a very dangerous thing.Hillary has a plan to build our schools, roads and bridges.  Trump wants to build a wall.On the issues we care about most, Hillary is standing with us.  That’s why we are going to stand with her from now until Election Day, and beyond.  Sisters and brothers, Hillary Clinton is our champion and we are going to elect her the next president of the United States!  California will show us the way!  And we’ll elect a Congress that will work with her.  We’ll lay the groundwork for the greatest growth of shared prosperity in American history.  We’re doing it now!We understand that the election is a beginning, not an end.  We are going to hold every one of our elected leaders accountable, from the White House on down.You see, our economy isn’t like the weather.  It doesn’t just happen to us.  No drought dried up our pensions.  The Santa Ana winds didn’t blow away America’s middle class.  Greedy corporations drove down our wages.  Ruthless CEOs and anti-worker politicians stole our pensions.  Billionaires like Trump sold our jobs overseas, because our trade deals and tax policies encourage and reward greed.What we do in California this year will transform our economy.  It’s about having an equal shot and a fair shake.  We’ll keep fighting.  Keep marching.  Keep building.  To win a new era of good jobs, strong unions and raising wages.This year, America’s labor movement will unleash the most comprehensive electoral program in our history.California can and will change the direction of this country, if we meet the challenge head on.Our strength grows from our unity.  It’s up to us to motivate each other.  As the leaders of California’s labor movement, it’s on you to move your members.  It’s on you to lead your members to volunteer, to turn out at unprecedented levels.Keep leading the way.  Keep blazing a trail forward.  As a national movement, we’ve been under attack so long, it can be hard to get out of a defensive crouch.  But no one plays offense like California!So it’s time to stand up strong, brothers and sisters.  It’s time to mobilize and organize.  This electoral season is all about raising wages.  We’re going to lay the groundwork.  We’ll hit the worksites.  We’ll talk to members.  We’ll walk the streets and knock the doors.  This is what a unified labor movement does.  This is what it looks like when working people stand together, union strong!We’ll fix what’s broken in our country.  We’ll heal through solidarity.  Together, we will create a better tomorrow.  It won’t be easy.  It won’t happen in an instance or through one election.   We’ll have to work for it, sisters and brothers.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.  Shoulder to shoulder. Arm in arm.  All day.  Every day.  Voting.  Fighting.  Winning.  Together.  To bring out the best in each other and ourselves.  To bring out the best in America.  To build the nation we can have and must have and will have!Thank you!  And God bless you!

321,Trumka Outlines a New Direction on Trade,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-outlines-new-direction-trade,6-28-2016,"Good morning, everyone.  Thank you Celeste [Drake] for that introduction and for your outstanding work on this issue.  And thanks to all of you for taking part in today’s critical conversation about the future of trade.I want to start with a word about last week’s referendum in Great Britain.  The Brexit vote sent a message loud and clear—we have to make democratic societies work for working people.  You can’t let Wall Street and the City of London run everything and then expect voters to say it’s okay.  We face this issue over and over again—with austerity, tax policy and yes, trade deals.  From Brussels to Washington, policymakers must understand that if we want to defend democracy from both the radical right and the out of touch elites, working people must help write the economic rules.  That is why our ongoing efforts to redefine the trade narrative have been so important.For too long, if you opposed a trade agreement for any reason, you were belittled as a protectionist, a dinosaur, as not understanding the complex reality of a global economy.  Even some of our friends told us we were fighting the last war.But our movement is trying to shape globalization, not stop it.  We have changed the debate by focusing on trade rules, the structures that for too long have killed jobs and lowered wages.This isn’t a matter of whether or not to trade.  Of course we should open up new markets for our products and do business with people all over the world.  The real challenge is to advance trade policy that creates shared prosperity and makes the world stronger and safer.  Bring us a deal like that and we’ll be ready to support it.At the beginning, we were hopeful the Trans-Pacific Partnership would be that deal.  A pro-worker, progressive administration talked about a new direction on trade.  The dedicated and hard-working team at the AFL-CIO provided detailed and substantive suggestions for the TPP, and mountains of evidence to support our positions.  But eventually it became clear that, behind closed doors, our ideas were being ignored.  Instead, corporations drove the agenda.  Once again, they were writing the rules.The final language of the TPP was based on the same outdated trade model that has devastated families and communities for decades.  It mirrors agreements like NAFTA, CAFTA and the WTO which have transferred wealth from working people to multinational corporations.  NAFTA in particular is still wreaking havoc on our economy—just ask the men and women who will soon lose their jobs at Carrier in Indianapolis or Mondelez in Chicago.Trade, by definition, should be a fair exchange.  We give up something, and you give us something in return.  Let me tell you, if the General Manager of the Pittsburgh Steelers made some of the trades our nation has over the last 25 years, he would be fired.  And rightly so.  For decades, our trade policy has made the ruling class richer and the working class poorer, not just here but around the world.  That isn’t trade. It’s corporate welfare.Two years ago, almost nobody thought these corporate trade deals could be stopped.  With the support of President Obama and the Republican leadership, the TPP looked like a slam dunk. Congress moved quickly to grease the skids with fast track authority.Well something happened along the way.  A groundswell of activism led by the people in this room slammed the brakes on the whole process.  Our strength stunned Washington.  Fast track limped through.  But nobody can ever say it won, because Goliath had been tamed, and everybody was looking at us with newfound and well-earned respect.  Think about what we’ve accomplished.  Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton came around to our position and now opposes the TPP.  With our help, she’s never going back.  Donald Trump talks a good game on trade, but his first and only loyalty is to himself.  Trump is giving a speech in Western Pennsylvania later today, not far from where I grew up.  Expect to hear crocodile tears about lost jobs and shuttered factories.  But Trump embodies everything that is wrong with our current trade policies.  He personally profited from NAFTA.  He told students at Trump University that outsourcing creates jobs.  And he has consistently sent American jobs overseas to line his own pockets.The people of Pittsburgh and towns like it deserve more than empty promises and bluster.  They need a public servant who shares our commitment to negotiating trade deals that work for working people, not a billionaire looking for his next buck.  When it comes to corporate trade, Donald Trump is the problem.  And Hillary Clinton is ready to help us find a solution.While we are heartened that the House does not currently have the votes to pass the TPP, this is not the time to rest on our laurels.  The threat of this unfair agreement remains, so we continue to point out its fundamental flaws.We must remind voters and elected officials alike that the TPP fails to address currency manipulation, giving foreign nations an ongoing free pass for cheating U.S. companies and workers.  We must expose the TPP for giving multinational corporations broad new powers and a special justice system to sue governments, including ours, for any laws that threaten their bottom lines—including labor and environmental protections.  We must reiterate that the TPP is a giveaway to Big Pharma, and would jeopardize people's access to affordable medicines.  We must reemphasize that the TPP will exacerbate economic displacement in Peru and Central America.  Finally, in light of the tragedy in Orlando, it is important to once again make clear that the TPP would give trade benefits to nations where you can be jailed or executed for being gay. The deal’s proponents are now saying that the TPP is essential to keeping China at bay.  When the corporate elite lose the economic argument, they tend to shift to geopolitics.  But far from bringing China into a system of global rules, the TPP is likely to give Beijing a pass.  It contains woefully weak rules for determining how much of a product needs to be made in the TPP countries to qualify for lower tariffs.  This means China and other non-TPP nations can reap many of the deal’s benefits without offering access to their markets or following rules on labor, environment, investment or intellectual property.This is a critical issue.  That’s why, during our conference today, we will explore it in depth, including hearing from a TPP supporter.  As I’ve always said, we encourage a free and open exchange of ideas, not the secrecy that dominated TPP negotiations.Let me close by talking about the road ahead.  As you know, the AFL-CIO recently endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, and we are going to do everything we can to elect her.  Much of the next five months will be spent empowering and mobilizing our members to make their voices heard at the polls.  Those of you who have been involved in a presidential race know how exhausting it can be.And yet, in the days following the election, we’ll be ready to fight back against any attempt to pass the TPP in a lame duck session of Congress.  We are sending that signal right now, because I expect we’ll hear offers of improved assistance for workers who lose their jobs and other Band-Aid fixes.  But those who argue we can fix structural problems with more Trade Adjustment Assistance are like Lucy asking Charlie Brown to kick the football again.  We need a different trade model, not crumbs from the table of the big corporations who are the only winners in the failed NAFTA model.  The TPP must be renegotiated or scrapped entirely.In the meantime, we will continue to be agile, smart, strategic and resilient.  Working together, I am confident that we will beat back the TPP.  And we will also be ready for future agreements like TTIP and TISA.The bottom line is, if they don’t work for working people, we will mobilize to defeat them, too.

322,Trumka: Unions Front and Center in Big Sky Country,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-unions-front-and-center-big-sky-country,6-24-2016,"Thank you, Sister Tammy [Pilcher].  I appreciate you and the Montana labor movement tremendously.  Unions are front and center in Big Sky Country.  Your movement is strong and growing, and that’s because your values are in exactly the right place.I want to welcome and thank each and every one of you here at the Montana AFL-CIO Convention.  It’s good to have so many allies and community members, as well as elected leaders.  I want you to know we will stand with and fight for the leaders who stand with and fight for us.America’s labor movement doesn’t work for any political party or any candidate.  We are led by a vision that grows from our values, and what we need to live a good life in Montana and across America.Our vision is why we support an expansive progressive political and legislative agenda.  And we intend to win real results.  Those wins will improve the lives of Montana’s working families. That’s our priority.The strength of labor in Montana is no accident.The breadth of unionism in Montana is evident in the number of your affiliates.  You’re deep. And that makes you powerful.  Your partnerships are growing, too, and that’s good news.  All across this country, the labor movement’s coalition is growing.Just look at how raising wages has grown as an issue this election season.  You see, together, we’ve changed the debate.  We’re no longer just talking about jobs.  We’re talking about good, union jobs that allow you to support yourself and your family.That’s not all.  Look at trade.  For years, the Wall Street and Washington elite have tried to paint us as against trade.  We’re not.  This isn’t a yes or no question.  It’s about the kind of trade we want.  Show us a trade deal that raises wages and standards and we’ll be the first to support it. But what we won’t do, what we refuse to do, is allow another corporate trade deal to be shoved down our throats.  That’s why with the help of leaders like Jon Tester we kicked the Trans-Pacific Partnership to the curb.  And let me tell you, we’ll beat that sucker like a drum if it ever comes up for a vote, because our families and communities deserve better.  We’ll kill the TPP. And then we’ll hold every elected leader who supported it accountable for their actions.Good wages and quality jobs are mainstream ideas in America today, and that’s why our labor movement is popular.  That’s also why it’s growing among young people and why we have a solid core of women leaders.  We’ve expanded the scope of what our labor movement fights for, and we’re expanding our democracy by registering and empowering hundreds of thousands of new voters.All of this and more is why Montana is poised to turn our vision into action.It starts with the absolute truth that each and every one of us should be decently paid for the work we do.  And we define what decent means!  No one should make less than the minimum wage, everyone should make a living wage, and collective bargaining should be available for all workers.  That’s not all.  Raising wages is about more than dollars and cents.  It’s about dignity, no matter who we love or how we worship.  It covers everything we care about.  Fair trade. Healthcare.  Just immigration.  Equal pay for equal work. Our vision will unite this country and build a better future.  Montana is hungry for it.  America is hungry for it.  We can do it, because we’re the ones who drive the buses and run the trains.  We build the bridges and lift the loads.  We teach the classes, clean the schools, clear the roads and load the trucks.  We do America’s work.  We make America go.  And we want our share of the American Dream, brothers and sisters.  So let’s stand for it, let’s march for it, and let’s win it!We’re in the midst of an incredibly important election year.Listen, I know Montanans are proud of their independence.You don’t care about political party or ideology.  You want men and women who get the job done. So it offends your sensibilities when you see gridlock in Washington.  It makes you upset when our leaders choose conflict over compromise and grandstand instead of govern.Sisters and brothers, it makes me upset, too.Ever since Barack Obama was elected, the Republican vocabulary has been reduced to one word: “no.”  It’s like being the parent of a four-year-old.No to creating jobs.  No to raising wages.  No to investing in infrastructure.  No to expanding unions.  No to a new direction on trade.  No to a vote on the President’s Supreme Court nominee.In their obsession with defeating President Obama, Republican leaders refused to work with him. So we haven’t been able to make the big changes working people need.  Everyday Americans are fed up.  And who can blame them?  They think Washington is broken.  By refusing to govern, Republican leaders have left working families behind.  And their inaction has created a monster. That monster is Donald Trump.Through his actions, his words and his ideas, Donald Trump is profoundly unfit to be president. And it’s not just me saying that.  It’s Republican leaders and conservative columnists.  It’s Mitt Romney and George W. Bush.  It’s 70 percent of Americans who view Trump unfavorably.Trump talks a good game, but he won’t solve America’s problems.  He is the problem.Name any core American value, and Donald Trump is against it.  Freedom of religion.  Freedom of the press.  Responsibility.  Equality.  Unity.  Integrity.  He stands against everything we stand for.His speech after the tragic massacre in Orlando showed that Trump is always eager to stoke the flames of fear and division. Can you imagine him in the White House during a major national crisis? As president, he would tear this country apart.Donald Trump talks a big game about making America great. He says he’s a friend of workers. But Trump doesn’t have our backs.  He wants to break our backs. Here are the facts.  Trump says our wages are too high.  Let me repeat that.  He says our wages are too high.  Trump wants to destroy labor unions.  His position on right to work is “100 percent.”  He refuses to bargain with workers at his hotel in Las Vegas.  Trump is pro-outsourcing.  He has consistently shipped American jobs overseas to line his own pockets. Here is all the proof you need: Donald Trump actually rooted for the collapse of the housing and real estate market two years before it happened.  Trump bet on himself and against America.  People lost their homes, their jobs, their life savings, their livelihoods.  And Donald Trump was profiting every step of the way.Sisters and brothers, Donald Trump is nothing more than a billionaire who made himself rich by making the rest of us poor.  And come November, we’re gonna say, loud and clear, Mr. Trump, You’re fired!Fortunately, we have a pro-worker candidate who understands that politics and paychecks are tied together.  Last week, the AFL-CIO proudly endorsed Hillary Clinton. Sisters and brothers, Hillary is a proven leader who is going to make a great president.  Time and again, she has listened to working people and stood with us to win positive change.  She is tough. She is smart.  She is committed.  And she understands that to truly make America great, unions must lead the way.  She’s with us.  And we’re with her.Clinton is traveling the country this week talking about raising wages.  She believes in a basic bargain where everyone who works for a living is able to get ahead.She’s with us on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  She said and I quote: “We need an entirely new trade policy that creates jobs in this country, not more low-wage jobs abroad.”She’s with us on infrastructure and has put forth a bold plan to rebuild our nation, create jobs and revitalize the middle class.She’s with us on equal pay for equal work and fair overtime rules and labor laws that level the playing field. Hillary Clinton will be a champion of workers in the White House.  And we will be her champion on the campaign trail. I must also say a word about Bernie Sanders, who won the Montana caucus.  The Democratic primary was one of the most productive and positive in recent memory, and Bernie played a big role in that.  He elevated critical issues like income inequality and strengthened the foundation of America’s labor movement.  I have no doubt he will stand with us to keep Donald Trump out of the White House, and put Hillary Clinton in it.And by the way, we’re going to make history here in Montana too, because you’ve got one of the best candidates for the U.S. House I’ve ever seen, heard of or talked to.  Working people are going to elect Denise Juneau a century after Jeanette Rankin became the first woman in America to win federal office.And I promise you, our labor movement will end this election year far stronger than we started. We have the power to change America!You see, our economy isn’t like the weather.  It doesn’t just happen to us.  Those chinook winds didn’t melt pensions away.  Corporate CEOs are taking them.  America’s middle class jobs aren’t just vanishing into thin air.  Bosses have been working overtime to drive down wages and ship American jobs overseas, because our trade and tax policies encourage them to.Our pain is because 40 of America’s richest people own 40% of this country.  Think about that for a moment.  Forty people, own more wealth than 40% of this nation.We’re going to change America.And what we do in Montana this year will transform the economy for those of us who count on a paycheck.  We’ll keep fighting.  Keep marching.  Keep building.  To win a new era of good jobs, strong unions and raising wages.This year, America’s labor movement will unleash the most comprehensive electoral program in our history, with a massive effort here in Montana.  We’ll fight for Governor Steve Bullock and pro-worker candidates up and down the ticket.  I’m asking you to step up.  Every local union in Montana should designate an election point person.  We have to be united: big unions and small, public sector and private. Raising wages is what we’re all about.  And we know the single best way to raise wages is with a collective bargaining agreement.  Good old-fashioned unionism will always be our top priority. That’s why it’s so important to engage in collective action.  That’s why organizing must be our daily mission.We’re building a movement.  It’s a movement where unions grow and inequality shrinks.  It’s a movement where you can grab onto the American Dream no matter what you look like, where you come from, how much money your parents have, or who you love.When it comes to doing right for working people, we define that vision.  We embody those values.  We will fix what’s broken in our country.  We have unity.  We have solidarity.  And we are ready to win justice and jobs today, and a better tomorrow.We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  We’ll stand for it.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity. Real solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line.  And my picket line is your picket line. Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm-in-arm.  All day.  Every day.  As long as it takes.  To win together. To grow together.  To bring out the best in ourselves and each other.  To bring out the best in America.  To build the America we can have, and must have, and will have.  Thank you, and God bless you!

324,Trumka: Collective Bargaining Boosts Worker Productivity,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-collective-bargaining-boosts-worker-productivity,6-15-2016,"Good morning everyone. Thank you, Karen (Nussbaum) for that introduction. And thank you to Working America for organizing today’s forum. It is great to be here for this important conversation.I want to recognize all of the outstanding congressional leaders who are participating in this event. Leader Pelosi. Senator Brown. Ranking Member Scott. Thank you for continuing to stand up for unions, our members and all working people.I also want to thank each of the panelists for sharing their expertise and experience.Finally, I want to thank Tim Collins for bucking the trend in the business world and speaking out on the importance of collective bargaining.Tim and I share similar backgrounds. We both come from Big Ten country—Tim grew up in Ohio, while my roots are in Pennsylvania. We both know what it’s like to rely on a paycheck.Tim worked in the auto industry. I followed my father and grandfather into the coal mines. We both enjoy the outdoors. And we both share a fundamental agreement about the need for a strong middle class.Tim is business. I am labor. But we are here today with one message: collective bargaining is essential to a strong economy and a civil society.Let me start by reading you a quote: “Today in America, unions have a secure place in our industrial life. I have no use for those—regardless of their political party—who hold some vain and foolish dream of spinning the clock back to days when organized labor was huddled, almost as a hapless mass. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.”Anyone know who said that? It was President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican and one of our nation’s greatest leaders. Eisenhower understood that when workers have a say, lives improve, communities thrive and businesses grow.When Ike said that in 1952, more than a quarter of all workers belonged to a union. But in the decades since, union membership has plummeted. Many businesses have adopted the Walmart model of a race to the bottom. Corporate-­backed politicians have tried to defund, dismantle and destroy unions. Right to work is now the law of the land in a majority of all states.This didn’t happen accidentally. Our economy is a set of rules. Those rules are written by the men and women we elect. They set the terms and conditions of the free market. They pick winners and losers. And despite the best efforts of our champions, working people have too often been on the wrong end of that equation.We see it in stagnant wages and mind­-numbing inequality. We see it in our shrinking manufacturing base. We see it in trade deals that export jobs instead of goods. And quite frankly, we see it in growing social tensions that have given rise to demagogues like Donald Trump.It doesn’t have to be this way. We can change the rules, help workers build better lives and create a climate that leads to economic growth and shared prosperity.Make no mistake, there is a moral argument for collective bargaining. It creates opportunity, lifts families out of poverty, keeps workers safe and provides an important counterweight to employers. But that’s not why we are here today. We are here because in a competitive global economy, the best way to boost productivity is by giving workers a strong, independent voice on the job.Everyone knows that to gain a competitive advantage, Henry Ford paid his workers enough to afford the Model T. But he made that decision in flush times when it was easy. And he did it on his terms. Without a union, it wasn’t sustainable. When the Great Depression came, he fired hundreds of thousands of workers, cut wages and turned machine guns on the people he employed. As we will hear today, it was only when Ford built a partnership with its workers through their union that the company was able to sustain itself as a high performance workplace.

Those lessons apply today. The key to productivity in the highly competitive, digitalized global economy is the wise use of human capital. Why does Germany have higher manufacturing wages and a trade surplus? It’s the combination of lifelong worker training, with employers, unions and government working together, and the protection of workers’ voices so that unions can partner with management to improve production.Here at home, the United Auto Workers, the Big Three manufacturers and a Republican and Democratic president joined in partnership to save the auto industry. Due to innovation and cooperation, carmakers are thriving again. It is a comeback story for the ages.Today we are going to hear from leading academics about the way worker voice and collective bargaining are good for business in construction and health care, two of the most important sectors of our economy.But this is not just a matter of making individual firms more competitive. It’s about the relationship between wages and demand. Some will tell you that raising wages hurts jobs. But 72 percent of our economy is driven by consumer spending. When you give people the money to take their family on vacation or send their kids to college, that leads to economic growth.So our challenge is to use public policy to create more workplaces where wages, workers and productivity thrive.Before we hear from our experts, I want to stress the fact that business leaders like Tim Collins are essential to this dialogue. In today’s political climate, it would be easy to assume that Tim is against unions. But he sees the big picture. He has experience managing high productivity union workplaces. He believes in structures that make compromise possible and profitable. He knows firsthand that diverse viewpoints make organizations stronger. And he sees unions as President Eisenhower did—as a force for stability and prosperity.I don’t want to mince words today. For a generation, much of our politics has tried to sweep issues like inequality and wage stagnation under the rug. For too long, we have avoided talking about the polices—whether unfair trade deals, financial deregulation or attacks on collective bargaining—that have left workers weaker and poorer.The result? Donald Trump has forced his way on stage. He has a perverse, hateful, dangerous way of talking about the real economic pain so many in our country feel. And we are now at risk of electing a profoundly unfit man to be president.There is a better way forward. We can build a prosperous, competitive America, where businesses and workers succeed. An America where we all have a voice, not just at the ballot box but in the workplace. Where everyone who works hard has the opportunity to succeed and each generation does better than the last.That is the future we must unite around. Business, labor and government working together. Only then can we build a nation that truly lives up to its greatest ideals. Thank you very much.

325,Trumka: Monetary Policy Must Promote Shared Prosperity,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-monetary-policy-must-promote-shared-prosperity,6-14-2016,"Good afternoon.  I’m Richard Trumka, President of the AFL-CIO.In a moment, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, Ranking Member of the House Committee on Financial Services, will give her keynote address, which is a perfect capstone to today’s conference.  First, though, I want to offer a few remarks on the significance of today’s discussion.First, I want to acknowledge the work of our Policy Department, and in particular our macroeconomist Tom Palley, for organizing this conference, not once, but twice, as the first attempt was snowed out.  I also hope you will join me in thanking our staff in the Policy and Facility Management departments who have made this event run so well.I also want to thank this morning’s speakers, who gave excellent presentations on the issues we face.  We heard about the economic importance of the exchange rate and what it means for monetary policy.  We listened to a thoughtful analysis of challenges posed by our Jekyll-and-Hyde economy, in which job growth has been strong while wage growth has been terrible.  And we are all concerned that financial instability remains a threat to all working families.The theme of this conference could not be more timely.  Today, the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee began a two-day meeting to consider raising the short-term interest rate.  Later this month, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will provide her semi-annual report to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs and the House Committee on Financial Services.The actions taken by the Federal Reserve and these important Congressional committees will have a tremendous impact on jobs and wages.That’s not all.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is still looming.  Later this month we will do a full day event addressing the challenges posed by our corporate dominated trade policy.  But we can’t wait—the challenges facing monetary policy and the impact of currency manipulation are so significant I want to address them right now.  And as we all know, the TPP simply fails to address this unfair trade practice, potentially locking the U.S. into a massive trading system that has devastated our manufacturing base.For these reasons and more, I hope the ideas presented and discussed here will shape the outcomes of those vital policy deliberations.I would like now to address these two points, wages and currency manipulation, in more detail.As we all know, eight years ago, as a result of decades of bad public policy and Wall Street greed, America suffered a financial crisis that shook the foundations of the entire global economy.  At the peak of the crash in late 2008, there were fears the world was on the verge of a second Great Depression.Fortunately, President Obama and a Democratic Congress took immediate and necessary action to stop the collapse in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Yet as soon as the crisis had receded from a catastrophic level, too many people downplayed its seriousness, arguing it had merely been caused by a financial shock that triggered an unusually deep recession, and that a bit of financial reform and a small dose of stimulus was all that was needed. So as unemployment rose, and wages fell, Policymakers abandoned the sensible fiscal policies of public investment and embraced the mistaken idea that austerity—cutting government spending and public employment—was the right medicine for economies suffering from slow growth, mass unemployment and recession-driven budget deficits. To its credit, the Federal Reserve was critical of this shift to austerity.  Then Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen spoke in detail here at the AFL-CIO in February 2013 warning that the fiscal tailwind of stimulus had given way to a stiff headwind of austerity.  And she noted the premature nature of this policy reversal compared to previous recessions.The Federal Reserve also deserves credit for rejecting the counsel of those who argued against lowering interest rates during the crisis; and who later wanted to prematurely raise interest rates to prevent what some said would be inevitable inflation.  Thanks to the Fed, interest rates stayed low, and inflation hasn’t been a problem.The policy battles over austerity illustrate the significance of economic policy for shared prosperity and full employment.  This is why the AFL-CIO organized today’s conference.America remains tangled in a basic debate, although we seldom tackle it head on.  I’m talking about how to create shared prosperity, which is the ultimate focus of today’s conference.  It’s a debate the Federal Reserve Bank must weigh in on, and do so on the right side.  That means fundamentally rethinking how the Fed looks at wages.The American economy was broken long before 2008, and it remains fundamentally out of balance today.  We know the problem all too well; how workers bargaining power has eroded, causing pay to languish even as productivity rises.  The result is our society has become more and more unequal, and America’s working families have suffered and continue to suffer.The Federal Reserve is implicated in this tragic history.  While the Fed has pursued admirable policies during times of “crisis” for which it should be commended, in “non-crisis” moments prior to 2008, the Fed failed to do its part to create an economy with rising wages.  By accepting the fictional notion of a natural rate of unemployment, and the idea that monetary policy cannot permanently lower unemployment, the Fed devalued the concept of full employ-ment.  In doing so, it lowered the importance of jobs and wages in the national economic conversation.Side-by-side, the Fed facilitated and gave credibility to the economic model that placed credit and asset price inflation above wage growth as the engine of demand.  This model set the stage for accelerated inequality in America and helped to ultimately destabilize our economy.Because of the leadership of President Obama and leaders like Congresswoman Waters, we escaped a second Great Depression.  But we have a lot more work to do.  We must change the economic model so that it again delivers for working families.The Fed cannot just put out financial fires.  It needs to take more seriously its mandate to pursue full employment—the critical ingredient of shared prosperity.  Otherwise, the American economy will remain dangerously out-of-balance, at risk of stagnation and vulnerable to another financial collapse.  How do we know when we reach full employment?  At a minimum, when wages rise with productivity in a sustained way.   Monetary policy can and must promote shared prosperity, and it will, if the tools and policy frameworks discussed today are adopted.  Now I want to talk specifically about trade, exchange rates and Federal Reserve monetary policy.The Treasury Department decides exchange rates, and Congress and the White House are responsible for trade agreements.  This much is true.  But all of these issues have a profound effect on the Federal Reserve and our entire economy.In fact, right now, manufacturing is again suffering from a strong dollar.  This is a predictable problem.  We’ve been here before.  It’s time for a fix.For too long, the Treasury’s formal responsibility for the exchange rate has been used as an excuse to avoid a full and open dialogue about these vital issues.  Exchange rates should get significant attention and public discussion from the Federal Reserve.  Because it is literally impossible to make monetary policy in the public interest without being able to have an open discussion of the impact of currency manipulation.That discussion has to include trade agreements.  The truth is, the TPP’s complete failure to address exchange rates or provide a remedy for currency manipulation are major problems that remain unaddressed.Let me close by connecting the dots between policy and policymakers.  Policy does not happen in a vacuum.  It is made by people.We should all be concerned about the inappropriate influence of commercial banks on the Federal Reserve, especially the district Federal Reserve banks.  The influence comes from the ownership stakes commercial banks have in the Fed.In addition, we should also all be concerned about the lack of diversity in representation within the Federal Reserve governance hierarchy.The undue influence of banks and lack of diversity help tilt Federal Reserve policy away from the pursuit of shared prosperity, and toward the economic model that has promoted wage stagnation, income inequality, trade deficits and manufacturing job loss.Policy is made by people, and there are few better than Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who has been a champion for shared prosperity and has long spoken out on the importance of building a fairer economy.Congresswoman Waters has represented California's 43rd Congressional District for 23 years, and she serves as the Ranking Member of the House Financial Services Committee, which is responsible for oversight of the Federal Reserve.  Her fearless hand has been felt on every piece of positive legislation I can remember, and America is better off for it.The AFL-CIO is deeply honored by her willingness to address today’s conference.  Please join me in a warm welcome for my sister and friend, Congresswoman Maxine Waters!

326,Trumka to Florida AFL-CIO: Working People Must Write the Economic Rules,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-florida-afl-cio-working-people-must-write-economic-rules,6-13-2016,"Thank you, Brother Mike [Williams].  I appreciate your leadership and your commitment to working families across Florida.  You’re a powerful leader of a strong and growing movement. I’m proud to call you my brother.Good afternoon, sisters and brothers.  I want to take this moment to recognize the good work all of you have done here in Florida over the past few years.  Your political activism has been impressive.  You’ve had to endure a Republican governor, a Republican legislature and the embarrassments that were Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio’s presidential campaigns.Well not only are Bush and Rubio long gone, you defeated every anti-union, anti-worker bill that came your way.  Every, single, one!  You did that!  Give yourselves a hand!One of your most powerful tools in the Florida labor movement has been your member-spokespeople.  Union officers like Mike and I have an important role to play in getting our message out there.  But there is no better messenger than a teacher or nurse or firefighter or janitor or ironworker.  These are the faces and the voices of the real people who together form our movement.Your commitment to lifting up these activists and building political strength for working families is evident all around us, and I’m here to applaud your efforts on behalf of the entire AFL-CIO, and encourage you to do more.Listen, on the national stage, it’s been all politics all the time, but the truth is we’ve still got our lives to lead.  Your members still have jobs to do and families to raise.  We’ve all got contracts to bargain, communities to mobilize and workers to organize.This year, we’re going to bring it all together, so we can empower our members and all working people across America.With her wins in California and New Jersey on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton took a major step toward the Democratic nomination.  She is on a collision course with Donald Trump this November, and next Thursday, the AFL-CIO General Board will meet to make our endorsement decision.As the primary season comes to an end, let’s remember one important fact: We set the tone for this presidential election year with our Raising Wages campaign.  Nearly two years ago, working people put forth an agenda that has defined the presidential debate.It starts with the absolute truth that we should be decently paid for the work we do.  And that we should define what decent means!  No one should make less than the minimum wage, everyone should make a living wage, and collective bargaining should be available for all workers.  Raising wages is about more than dollars and cents, though.  It covers everything working people care about.  Fair trade.  Just immigration.  Equal pay for equal work.  And so much more.We’re going to keep these issues front and center today, tomorrow, through the election and beyond.  You see, we can unite this country and build a better future.  Florida is hungry for it.  America is hungry for it.  We can do it, because we’re the ones who drive the buses and run the trains.  We build the bridges and lift the loads.  We clear the roads and load the ships.  We mine the coal and generate the power.  We do America’s work.  We make America go.  And we want our share of the American Dream, brothers and sisters.  So let’s stand for it, let’s march for it, and this fall, let’s vote to make it a reality!To get what working people want and need, working people have to be in charge.  We have to write the economic rules.That’s what we intend to do, but it won’t be easy.As leaders in the labor movement, you know your members.  You know your communities.  You know how hard it is in today’s economy for working families.  Flat wages.  Growing inequality. Diminishing opportunity.  And a political class that has fallen badly out of touch with everyday Americans.The truth is, the power of the working family message can be seen in the number of people who are trying to ride our coattails.  The number one imposter is Donald Trump.  He talks a big game about making America great.  He says what’s easy and popular.  But Donald Trump doesn’t have our backs.  He wants to break our backs.  Donald Trump is a fraud.  He is one of the most anti-worker presidential candidates in American history.Here are the facts.  Trump says our wages are too high.  Let me repeat that.  He says our wages are too high.  You can’t support workers if you want to lower our pay.Trump wants to destroy labor unions.  His position on right to work is “100 percent.”  He is refusing to bargain with workers at his hotel in Las Vegas.  And he said he wouldn’t mind doing away with unions all together.  You can’t support workers and be against unions!Trump is pro-outsourcing.  Don’t let his rhetoric fool you.  He has consistently shipped American jobs overseas to line his own pockets.  You can’t support workers and be pro-outsourcing.Here is all the proof you need: we recently learned that Donald Trump actually rooted for the collapse of the housing and real estate market two years before it happened.  In 2006, he said and I quote: “I’m excited.  I’ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.""Trump bet on himself and against America.  I don’t have to tell you about the foreclosure crisis here in Florida.  People lost their homes, their jobs, their life savings, their livelihoods.  And Donald Trump was cheering all the way to the bank.Sisters and brothers, Donald Trump is nothing more than a billionaire who made himself rich by making the rest of us poor.  And come November, we are going to kick his ass.Working people are going to come out of this election year far stronger than we were before.We’re going to keep building our political independence.  We’ll keep our issues front and center. We’ll stand for the candidates who stand with us.We have the power to change America!Our economy isn’t like the weather.  It doesn’t just happen to us.  The wind doesn’t blow pensions into the Gulf of Mexico.  Corporate CEOs are taking them.  America’s middle class jobs aren’t vanishing into thin air.  Bosses have been working overtime to drive down wages and ship American jobs overseas, because our trade and tax policies encourage them to.And what we do in Florida this year can transform the economy for those of us who count on a paycheck.  We’ll keep fighting.  Keep marching.  Keep building.  To win a new era of good jobs, strong unions and raising wages.To make that happen, America’s labor movement must unleash the most comprehensive electoral program in our history, with a focus right here in Florida.  It starts with each local designating an election point person.  We have to be united: big unions and small, public sector and private.  We know how to run these campaigns.  We know how to win.  We know how to connect with regular working people, both in unions and outside of them.  Quite frankly, the most powerful tool in the union tool box is our members’ conversations with each other and their neighbors.Elections matter.  And so does every single vote.  You know that better than anyone.  George W. Bush beat Al Gore here—if he even actually won—by less than 600 votes.  And working people are still suffering from that disastrous presidency.  By the way, even George Bush thinks Donald Trump is nuts.How we lead matters.  How we mobilize matters.  So listen to your members.  Empower new activists.  When working people stand up and speak out, we win.  We have a great opportunity in front of us, to stake out new ground instead of getting stuck on defense year after year.The corporate right-wing is going to throw everything at us.  They’ll fight hard, but we’ll fight harder.  We have the power!  When we stand together, the numbers are on our side!We’ll stand together today, tomorrow, and as long as it takes to win for Florida’s working families, and for America!Sisters and brothers, we are on a mission to raise wages.  That’s our agenda, and our agenda drives our politics, not the other way around.Raising wages is what we’re all about.  And we know the single best way to raise wages is with a collective bargaining agreement.  Good old-fashioned unionism will always be our top priority. That’s why it’s so important to engage in collective action.  That’s why organizing must be our daily mission.And that’s also why we will continue to grow our political power.  With it, we’ll win new investments in infrastructure, education, technology, medical research, job training, you name it. And we’ll build a level playing field for every worker who wants a voice on the job.We’re building a movement.  It’s a movement where unions grow and inequality shrinks.  It’s a movement where you can grab onto the American Dream no matter what you look like, where you come from, how much money your parents have, or who you love.When it comes to doing right for working people, we define that vision.  We embody those values.  We will fix what’s broken in America.  We have unity.  We have solidarity.  And we are ready to win justice and jobs today, and a better tomorrow.We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  We’ll stand for it.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity. Real solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line.  And my picket line is your picket line. Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm-in-arm.  All day.  Every day.  As long as it takes.  To win together. To grow together.  To bring out the best in ourselves and each other.  To bring out the best in America.  To build the America we can have, and must have, and will have.Thank you, and God bless you!

327,Trumka at DNC LGBTQ Pride Reception: We are Never Going Back,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-dnc-lgbtq-pride-reception-we-are-never-going-back,6-10-2016,"Thank you, Stuart [Appelbaum] for that introduction and for your leadership at the RWDSU and UFCW.  I am proud to call you my brother.I want to thank the DNC, the RWDSU and Pride at Work for hosting this reception.I want to recognize DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, DNC LGBT Caucus Chair Earl Fowlkes, Congressman Mark Takano, Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, Congressman Jared Polis, Pride at Work Executive Director Jerame Davis, and all of the labor, elected and LGBTQ leaders here tonight.And I want to welcome each of you to the House of Labor.  Let’s be honest: no one knows how to throw a party like the LGBTQ community.A year ago this month, we celebrated a Supreme Court decision that guaranteed every American could marry the person they love.It was a profound and historic moment.  But it wasn’t enough.  Not nearly enough.Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans can still be fired in over half of all states. Unless, of course, they have a union contract!Religion is being used as a license to discriminate.Transgender people of color are being murdered at rates that shock the conscience.Our immigration system still victimizes LGBTQ people.There has been a wave of Jim Crow-style bathroom bills.And Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president.Take a second to breathe.When I hear people ask what’s next after marriage, my answer is: EVERYTHING!Many LGBTQ people will get married.  That’s wonderful.  But we all need a job.  We all need to be protected from violence.  And barring a medical miracle, we all need to pee.I want to make something very clear: the AFL-CIO and the entire labor movement will not rest until every single LGBTQ person has equal rights under the law.Our two movements share common values: dignity, respect, equality, solidarity.  It is no coincidence that labor rights and LGBTQ rights are being attacked by the very same people in the very same places.So we have to organize.  A collective bargaining agreement remains the single greatest tool for fighting discrimination in America.But our lives don’t stop when we punch the clock at the end of a day.That’s why we are fighting for legislation like the Equality Act to ban discrimination in employment, housing, accommodations and much more.And that’s why this year we are going to elect candidates who support worker and LGBTQ rights.I mentioned Donald Trump earlier.  What can I even say at this point?He’s what you call a hot mess.Trump would be a disaster for workers.  He is anti-union, anti-woman, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and of course, anti-LGBTQ.Make no mistake, Trump loves himself and hates all of us.When he says “Make America Great Again,” what he really means is take America back to a time when LGBTQ people were in the closet, women were in the kitchen, immigrants were in the shadows and only straight white men were in the White House.Friends, we are never going back to those days!We are moving forward.Under President Obama’s leadership, we have secured victories on hate crimes, military service, marriage and discrimination in federal contracting.The next president needs to build on this foundation, not tear it down.With her wins in California and New Jersey on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton took a major step toward the Democratic nomination.She is on a collision course with Donald Trump this November.As the primary season comes to an end, let’s remember one important fact: Working people set the tone for this election.  The Democratic primary was about union ideas, union policies and the union advantage.  The candidates campaigned on our terms and for that we should be extremely proud.As we transition to the general election, this much is clear: working people have a clear choice.Let’s declare tonight loudly and proudly that 2016 will be a year of progress.And let’s put Donald Trump and his ideas right where they belong: in the trash bin of history. So with that, I want to thank all of you again.  I hope you have a wonderful Pride month.  Let’s celebrate and then, let’s get to work!

328,Trumka to OPEIU Delegates: You Show Us How It's Done,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-opeiu-delegates-you-show-us-how-its-done,6-8-2016,"Thank you, Brother Richard [Lanigan].  I appreciate your leadership and your commitment to working families across America.  You’re a powerful leader of a strong union, and I’m proud to call you my brother.Good afternoon, sisters and brothers.  I want to take this moment to recognize the importance of the Office and Professional Employees International Union.  You’re so diverse, in so many industries, from podiatrists to insurance agents, credit union workers to higher ed employees, you’re everywhere, and you organize.  It’s wonderful to see.  Keep up the good work. Activism in America has been increasing, thanks in no small part to your union.  I’m thinking specifically of when I stood with OPEIU cab drivers in Las Vegas.  You showed us how it’s done!  That was a powerful picket line, and together we won!That was a special victory.  It’s a big deal when we use our collective strength, when a central labor council and a state federation of labor coordinate dozens of unions to stand together, honor a picket line and achieve a hard-won victory.And this just happened.  Working people stood together and won together in the bargaining fight between 40,000 CWA and IBEW members and Verizon.  OPEIU members were there.  I saw you.  Those were some powerful picket lines, too.  We stood strong.  We marched.  We demanded better.  Day after day.  And then, after we held the picket line for well over a month, America’s Labor Secretary Tom Perez called both sides to the table.I’ll be perfectly clear.  Secretary Perez didn’t take our side.  He was fair.  That’s all we need: Fairness.  Verizon executives got a seat at the table.  We did, too.  Our union workers stood toe-to-toe and came away winners, with better-than 10% raises, protection from layoffs and outsourcing, and thousands of new wireless members.All we want, brothers and sisters, all we need, is a fair chance.With a fair chance, we can walk away winners.  I don’t know what OPEIU’s next contract fight will be, but I know you will set a high bar.  If you need help, I’m only a phone call away, and I know 40,000 fired up and thankful CWA and IBEW members who are ready to join us.  Let’s use our CLCs, our state federations of labor and the entire AFL-CIO!  That’s how we build the middle class!But we can’t stop there.  We have to connect the dots between our organizing, our bargaining, and right now, our electoral activism.  Each of these things affects the others.This year, we will lay the groundwork for raising wages as we elect our union-endorsed candidates!We have to start with a simple truth: our economy isn’t like the weather.  It doesn’t just happen to us.  We can transform our jobs with activism.  And we can shape our economy with the leaders we elect.At the ballot box and the bargaining table, let’s go toe-to-toe.  Let’s mobilize.  Let’s win.We can do it, because we do America’s work.  We make America go.  And we want our share of the American Dream, brothers and sisters.  So let’s stand for it, let’s march for it, let’s fight for it, and this fall, let’s vote for it!The final shape of the presidential campaign is becoming more and more clear.  Democrats are winding down a powerful primary that has captured our ideas and our agenda.  The party and the country are better for it.With her wins last night in California and New Jersey, Hillary Clinton took a major step toward the Democratic nomination.  Everything indicates that she is on a collision course with Donald Trump this November.As the AFL-CIO goes forward, I promise you one thing: We will unite America’s working people to elect a working family candidate to the White House.  We will connect the dots for workers from coast to coast.  We will empower union members and our friends and neighbors with an electoral program unprecedented in scope and sophistication.  We intend to turn out the vote in key states for working family candidates.  It’s a critical part of our larger strategy to rebuild the American middle class with a robust Raising Wages agenda.Our agenda has set the terms and conditions of this election.  The campaign has been framed by union ideas, union policies and the union difference.On trade, for example, for the first time in more than a generation, we changed the rules of the debate.  Instead of “yes” or “no” on trade, we made it about trade that works for working families, and trade that doesn’t.  And instead of just talking about jobs, we made the conversation about the quality of jobs. In addition, we began to shine a light on the real villains behind flat wages and disappearing jobs.  Greedy CEOs.  Bought and paid for politicians.  Wall Street profiteers.We have a tough fight ahead.  As leaders in the labor movement, you know your members.  You know your communities.  You know how hard it is in today’s economy for working families. You know how anxious and frustrated people are.  And you know how badly out of touch many politicians are with the lives and concerns of everyday Americans.  Even worse, there are those who are trying to play on our anxiety for their own personal gain.It’s our responsibility to expose these frauds, and there is none bigger than Donald Trump. Trump is as bad for workers as Trump University was to the poor folks who took his classes.Here’s the truth: Donald Trump got rich by making us poor.  He is one of the most anti-worker presidential candidates in American history.Trump says our wages are too high.  Let me repeat that.  He says your wages are too high.  And yours.  And yours.  You can’t be for workers and want to cut our pay.  That’s insane.Trump wants to destroy labor unions.  His position on right to work is “100 percent.”  He is refusing to bargain with workers at his hotel in Las Vegas.  And he said he wouldn’t mind doing away with unions all together.  You can’t be for workers and against our right to organize.And you know how he claims to be against outsourcing?  He’s not.  He has sent American jobs all over the globe, all in pursuit of his own profit.  You can’t be for workers and against job security.But Donald Trump is not only bad for working people.  A Trump presidency would tear America apart.Trump hurls threats, lies and racist comments like a schoolyard bully.  He seems to hate women. Any one of those things would disqualify him from holding America’s highest office.  Donald Trump offends the very idea of the White House.  He is unfit to serve as dog catcher, let alone president of the United States.Sisters and brothers, Donald Trump will say and do anything to get elected, but we know better. On November 8, the labor movement is going to send Trump this simple message: you’re fired.We’re going to treat this election like the biggest organizing battle or contract fight you’ve ever seen.  Every one of you is a leader.  Lead by example.  Empower new activists.  We’re encouraging each of your locals to designate an election point person to coordinate with the state and local AFL-CIO, and our national campaign team.  We are going to win by working together.Donald Trump and the corporate right-wing will throw everything at us.  They’ll fight hard, but we’ll fight harder.  We have the power!  The truth is on our side.  We’ll stand together today, tomorrow, and as long as it takes to win for America’s working families!Sisters and brothers, we will beat Donald Trump and the right-wing agenda, but that’s not all. We are on a mission to raise wages.  That’s our agenda, and our agenda drives our politics, not the other way around.Raising wages is what we’re all about.  And we know the single best way to raise wages is with a collective bargaining agreement.  You showed that in Las Vegas.  Verizon workers proved it up and down the east coast.  And millions of Americans are ready to join us.We’re building a movement.  It’s a movement where unions grow and inequality shrinks.  It’s a movement where you can grab onto the American Dream no matter what you look like, where you come from, how much money your parents have, or who you love.We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  We’ll stand for it.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity. Real solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line.  And my picket line is your picket line. Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm-in-arm.  All day.  Every day.  As long as it takes.  To win together. To grow together.  To bring out the best in ourselves and each other.  To bring out the best in America.  To build the America we can have, and must have, and will have.Thank you, and God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
329,Trumka Pledges to Take on Wall Street,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-pledges-take-wall-street,5-24-2016,"Good afternoon.  On behalf of the 12.5 million working men and women of the AFL-CIO, I am proud to be here to kick off this campaign.I want to thank Senator Warren for her incredible leadership on financial reform and all of the issues important to working people.  We have no greater champion.  And I want to thank our outstanding partners.  This really is a team effort.Today is about rewriting the economic rules.  It’s about making our financial system the servant, rather than the master, of the real economy.For too long, Washington has reacted to crises instead of preventing them.A bridge falls and we rebuild it.Our economy crashes and we try to dig our way out of it.Being reactive is valid and often necessary.  The Dodd-Frank legislation enacted in the wake of the Great Recession was a good first step.It reined in some of Wall Street’s most reckless practices and brought newfound stability to our financial markets.But it was designed only to deal with acute, urgent problems.Now, at this time of relative economic calm, some are tempted to say “good enough for government work.”But it’s not.  We can’t sit back when it comes to the economic security of working families.  It is time to go on offense.  The rules should be written by and for the people who live in the economy, not the billionaires who live off the economy.Here’s why:The status quo is not working.  By design.  Many of our economic and financial rules were written by and for wealthy special interests.  And even in the case of Dodd-Frank, too many critical decisions were left in the hands of regulators.  We need a bigger and bolder approach.The proposals at the heart of our campaign—taxing Wall Street transactions, ending too big to fail and restoring Glass-Steagall, making CEOs and hedge fund managers pay their fair share and providing safe and reliable banking options to all Americans—will drastically improve the way financial services function.  That means more money in the pockets of working families and hundreds of billions of dollars to boost our economy.We are going to fight for these reforms here in Congress and on the campaign trail.It is time for Wall Street to serve Main Street, not the other way around.It is time to invest in America again—infrastructure, jobs, education, technology, you name it.And we simply cannot do that without a 21st century financial system that puts workers and consumers first.So let’s get to work.Thank you very much.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

330,Trumka Alongside Chamber of Commerce: Infrastructure Matters,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-alongside-chamber-commerce-infrastructure-matters,5-16-2016,"What a pleasure it is to be here with President Tom Donahue in support of good jobs for working people, competitive businesses and a rising middle class.Tom, I’m glad you could join us at this event for card check to grow America’s unions!I knew that would make you grin.Frankly, though, while we disagree about some things, we both agree that infrastructure matters.  Robust and sustainable investment in America’s infrastructure is one of the core functions of a successful civilization, and I use that word for a reason:We need healthy and safe water systems, not just in Flint, Michigan, but all across America that meet the standard of a civilized nation.We need a safe and effective energy and utility infrastructure, including natural gas and oil pipelines, that don’t leak or break down or otherwise put harmful chemicals in our air or water. And we must make sure investments in new technology create good jobs and shared prosperity.This isn’t a bonus.  This is the basics.We need functioning transportation systems, bridges, highways, railways, ports and metro services in our major cities, including right here in D.C.A new report from the American Society of Civil Engineers shows the danger of disinvestment. Failing to address our infrastructure needs costs families $3,400 a year in disposable income.  Our infrastructure investment gap if left unchecked will, by 2025, deprive workers of 2.5 million jobs, cost our businesses $7 trillion dollars and take nearly $4 trillion out of our economy. We know how we got here, and we know how to fix it. Inaction is a curse.  Investment is a blessing.  We represent well-trained, highly-skilled workers across America who are ready to get to work.As we invest the $4 trillion we need to fix America’s infrastructure, we will create millions of good-paying, family-sustaining jobs.  This will lower unemployment, raise wages and give our economy the kick start it needs.A stronger economy means more profits for American companies, investment to meet rising demand and a virtuous growth cycle, which can usher in a new era of broadly shared prosperity.And that is also something we can all agree on. © 2023 AFL-CIO.

331,Trumka to Penn State Law Graduates: Use Your Degree as a Force for Moral Good,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-penn-state-law-graduates-use-your-degree-force-moral-good,5-14-2016,"Dean Houck, thank you for that kind introduction.  I also want to thank the administration, faculty, staff and alumni that have built Penn State Law into a premier academic institution.  And to my fellow Nittany Lions, the Class of 2016, congratulations.  You did it!It is great to be back in State College.  This is a wonderful place.  The beauty, the excitement, the diversity, the football.  It has everything.I was raised about 170 miles from here in Nemacolin.  Listen, I love my hometown.  Coal country instilled in me a core set of values.  Toughness.  Work ethic.  Sacrifice.  But I’ll be honest, Greene County, Pennsylvania isn’t exactly a happening place.  When I was growing up, people looked the same and acted the same and did the same jobs.  Like many small communities in America, there was a need to fit in.     Penn State was different.  I was able to meet students from all over the country and the world. Many are still my friends today.  Issues were debated passionately.  Groupthink was frowned upon.  Happy Valley brought together a broad array of ideas and experiences.  It was truly liberating.I didn’t just make great connections at Penn State, I also found my love of learning.  I was taught by some of the greatest instructors in the world.  I’ve been hooked on the Civil War ever since I took a history class here.  And Professor Heitman became my advisor and friend.  That was over 40 years ago.So as you head off to your next adventure, I want you to remember how special this place is. Don’t ever take it for granted.  Penn State is a family.  And I am incredibly proud to call you brothers and sisters.Now, I have a confession to make: I got my law degree from Villanova.  And I am not currently a practicing attorney.  If you’ve read my biography, you know that I am president of the AFL-CIO.  Our federation represents 56 unions and 12.5 million workers—from teachers and electricians to engineers and professional athletes.So how did I get from Nemacolin to the head of the labor movement?  It all started when I was twelve years old.One night, I was sitting on my grandfather’s porch.  He was a coal miner.  So was my father. And eventually, so was I.  Around this time, the mine workers were in the midst of a brutal strike.  I was complaining to my granddad about how badly they were being treated.So he asked me what I planned to do about it.  “When I grow up, I could be a politician,” I said. He playfully smacked me across the back of the head.  Clearly, I needed to come up with a better answer.  “I could become a lawyer and stand up for workers’ rights.”  Jackpot.  My grandfather then said something that has stuck with me ever since.  “If you want to help workers, you first need to help people.”And that is the message I want to share with you today.  You have an extraordinary opportunity and responsibility to use your law degree as a force for moral good.In last year’s landmark Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the following: “The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our times.  The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all its dimensions.  So they entrusted to future generations a charge protecting all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.”That is now your charge.Make no mistake, it won’t be easy.  A law degree is not an automatic ticket to success.  You will soon enter an extremely competitive job market.  Many of you have student loans to pay off. There is the bar exam.  Early on, it may seem overwhelming.Don’t be discouraged.  You worked your tail off to get here.  The greatest reward for hard work is the opportunity to serve others.  The harder you work, the more opportunities you’ll have.  In the end, activism will erase your debts and fill your hearts.Wherever you end up, the skills you learned in law school will prove invaluable.  I came from a coal mine, but the legal education I received has made it possible for me to represent working people effectively in front of U.S. Senators and cabinet secretaries and at international forums.Your challenge is to use these skills to make the world a better place in your own way.  I got my start helping coal miners win fair pay, good benefits and a secure retirement.For you, it will likely be something different.  Perhaps you want to be an advocate for victims of domestic violence.  Maybe your mission is to make our immigration system fairer and more just. You could serve in government, become an educator, practice corporate law, open your own firm or do pro bono work for a cause you believe in.  The options are endless.Let me give you one dramatic example.Betty Anne Waters went to law school in order to exonerate her brother for a murder he did not commit.  Waters was a waitress and had only a high school equivalency when she began taking night classes at the Community College of Rhode Island and eventually the Roger Williams University School of Law, all while raising two kids.  The process took nearly 20 years.But Waters not only got her JD, she uncovered DNA evidence that authorities claimed had been destroyed, convinced the Innocence Project to take the case, persuaded witnesses to recant their testimony and successfully had her brother’s sentence overturned.Her incredible journey was featured in the film Conviction.  Waters’ courage and perseverance is a reminder that law school is what you make of it.  So I encourage you to start thinking about writing your own story.I also want to stress the importance of ethics.  Former Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart said ethics is knowing the difference between what you have a right to do, and what is right to do.There are some in the legal world who think it is somehow noble to represent the rich and powerful against the poor and voiceless.Don’t ever lose sight of the fact that you choose your clients.  And you get to decide whether to practice law in a way that upholds justice, or thwarts it.There are going to be times when a superior or a client tells you to cross the line.  If you listen, it may help advance your career in the short term.  What will you do in that moment?  You can either take the path that is easy.  Or you can make the hard decision to do the right thing, even if it costs you a promotion in the process.As I said before, the temptation to let your guard down will be great.  More money.  More power.  A corner office.  But at what cost?When I graduated law school, I immediately received job offers from the coal industry.  They rolled out the red carpet.  They wanted to use my talent and experience to increase their bottom line—and mine—at the expense of workers.  I couldn’t do it.  No amount of money can make up for not being able to look at yourself in the mirror.You will face your own hard choices.  There will be opportunities to get ahead by helping those who are greedy or morally bankrupt.  Don’t do it.  Have the courage to say no.  Apply the logic and tactics you learned in law school to choose a path that is just.  Speak truth to power, not just in defense of your clients, but to your colleagues who push you to cross the line “just a little bit.” Remember, every time you cross the line “just a little bit,” the line moves further and further away from what is right.I also want you to keep in mind that there is work and there is life.  You have to give both the proper attention.  There will be a demand for billable hours and long trips and late nights at the office.  Never forget to make time for the people you love—your parents, siblings, friends, significant others and most of all, your children.  To the family members here today: look after these graduates.  Continue to give them your support.  They will look to you for guidance and understanding in the stressful days ahead.Let me close by talking about a past commencement address here at Penn State.  In 1955, President Dwight Eisenhower said and I quote: “The divisions between us are artificial and transient.  Our common humanity is God-made and enduring.”The divisions Eisenhower described 61 years ago persist today.  We are bitterly divided politically.  You just have to turn on cable or check Facebook to see that.  America is growing ever more unequal economically.  The gap between the rich and the poor has never been wider.  More and more of us work harder and harder and yet remain mired in economic insecurity.Too many of our leaders seek to divide us on the basis of gender, race, religion and sexual orientation, in brazen plays for power, fame and fortune.But I believe Eisenhower’s broader message still rings true today.  Neither God nor nature divides us.  Human beings built the walls that separate us.  And we can tear them down.  We share a desire for economic advancement.  We all want the right to live well and raise our families in peace and security, no matter where we live or what we look like.  Each of us yearns for the opportunity to reach our potential.  These hopes and dreams are captured by the words engraved on the front of the Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under Law.As the next generation of lawyers, you can challenge the forces that seek to tear us apart.  You can help bring us together.  You can advance justice, expand freedom and promote fairness.  You can do the right thing, the right way, for the right reasons.  You can take the education you received here and apply it to real problems.  Poverty, violence, racism, inequality, you name it. The world is now your courtroom.As President Eisenhower said, our common humanity is God-made and enduring.  And so is our obligation to each other.  So get out there and make us proud.We are … crowd responds Penn State.We are … crowd responds Penn State.We are … crowd responds Penn State.Thank you very much.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

332,"Trumka: Rise of the Right a ""Disturbring Transatlantic Pattern""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-rise-right-disturbring-transatlantic-pattern,5-9-2016,"Welcome to the AFL-CIO!  Thank you Cathy [Feingold] for that introduction and for your leadership.  Thank you to our partners FES and Working America for helping put this event together.  And I want to welcome all of our distinguished guests who have traveled here from far away.  Special thanks to Sharan [Burrow] and Luca [Visentini] for your commitment to workers around the world.Let’s face it, we can no longer afford to dismiss the rise of the right and the impact it is having on working people in the United States and abroad.  Last week, Donald Trump became the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party.  This thing is real.  And it is not going away.But Trump’s rise didn’t just happen in a vacuum.  In America, this moment has been coming for some time.So how did we get here?  And what can we do about it?For decades, politicians from both of America’s major political parties have tilted the economic rules in favor of the corporate elite.  Wall Street referees were taken off the field.  There were trade deals like NAFTA and CAFTA that benefited corporations at our expense.  Jobs were lost and not adequately replaced.  We failed to make needed investments in infrastructure and energy and job training.  The right to join and form a union was attacked in board rooms, legislative halls and at the ballot box.  And when all of this led to an economic crisis, we implemented austerity measures that continue to erode social protections, wages and workers’ rights.Just like Donald Trump didn’t just appear out of thin air, our economy didn’t get upside down on its own. It is the result of deliberate polices aimed at consolidating wealth in the hands of the few. Wages have been flat for decades.  The gap between the rich and the poor has never been wider. And union density has fallen from a peak of 35 percent to just over 11 percent, with only 6 percent of private sector workers organized today.Americans are fed up.  We work hard, play by the rules and take care of ourselves and our families.  Yet we keep being asked to do more with less.  Less jobs.  Less health care.  Less time off.  Less retirement.So when someone like Donald Trump says we’re losing, he finds a sympathetic audience who wishes more politicians would express the frustration they feel every day.  When he rips bad trade deals or blames Mexico or China for our economic woes, his message is heard.  And to people who are sick and tired of the status quo, Trump might represent a fresh start.He also represents a delusion.  In reality, Trump would make life measurably worse for those of us who count on a paycheck.  He decries unfair trade, yet is on record saying outsourcing creates jobs in the long run.  He has routinely attacked the rights of workers at his own company.  And despite the fact that Americans haven’t gotten a real raise in 40 years, Trump says wages are too high.He also viciously attacks immigrants, including the 11 million undocumented workers in America who work hard and want nothing more than a secure future for themselves and their families.  His anti-immigrant positions reflect growing xenophobia here and around the world.Trump is a bigot and a fraud.  And we in the American labor movement are going to spend the next six months telling workers about his real agenda.  But let’s be clear, the rise of the right has not been confined to the United States.  You know that firsthand. Throughout Europe, you face the same challenges we do.  Failed austerity policies.  Rising inequality.  High unemployment.  And a migration crisis.With these come disillusionment, and now, a disturbing transatlantic pattern.In France, Marine Le Pen’s National Front Party currently leads the presidential race, jeopardizing the entire European Union from the top down.  Until recently, this was a smaller movement but today it has rebranded itself to become part of Europe’s radical right. 
Denmark is experiencing similar trends with the Danish People’s Party running on an anti-Islamist and anti-immigrant platform. In the UK, there has been the rise of UKIP, which is taking a leading role in Britain’s EU “Brexit” referendum, with the hopes of using that issue to build a broader based extremist coalition.And this right-wing resurgence is reverberating throughout Eastern Europe—from Hungary to Poland to Slovakia.It is clear our opposition is global and growing.  Today’s meeting is an opportunity to develop strategies to stop the rise of the right and reengage workers around a vision of shared prosperity. I greatly look forward to hearing your ideas.  Our Canadian brothers and sisters may have some thoughts on how to defeat right-wing, anti-worker politicians.  And all of you have invaluable experience building worker-led movements.Here in the United States, that is our mission.  We are mobilizing union members to build an economy that works for all working people.  But we aren’t stopping there.  We are reaching out to all workers, including those without a union contract.  That’s why we started Working America in the first place.  As a result, we now have 3 million additional members and supporters outside of our traditional structure who are helping lead our fights and elect our candidates.We are going to challenge Donald Trump head on and focus anger toward the real villains: multinational corporations, Wall Street and the politicians who carry their water.  We will reject the idea of building walls, whether physical or systemic.  We will stand up to the forces that are trying to stoke our fears about national security and zero sum economics.We have an opportunity to make real lasting change, to be the ones who write the economic rules.  But it will not be given to us.  It’s something we have to win.  It will rise from our activism and our collective voice.That’s what I want to leave you with today.  Identifying, confronting and exposing the right is a global challenge that requires a global solution.  In each of our countries, we have seen the beginnings of a worker uprising that has the potential to carry our agenda forward.  We need to foster and grow that movement so it can beat back threats and go on offense for good jobs, raising wages, broadly shared prosperity and bigger, stronger unions.Working together, I am confident we can do exactly that.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

333,Trumka Addresses Verizon Picket Line,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-addresses-verizon-picket-line,4-26-2016,"Brothers and sisters: We’ve got your back.  That’s my number one message to you.  We have your back!And when I say, “WE,” I’m not just talking about those of us standing here.  I don’t just mean the tens of thousands of CWA and IBEW members up and down the east coast.  I’m talking about the millions and millions of working people of the AFL-CIO.We are in this together, because what happens to you happens to us.  When it comes to standing up for working people in America, standing up for what’s fair, standing up for what’s right, you are the tip of the spear.  You don’t simply represent yourselves. You represent all of us.  This is what our movement is all about. You are the front line, and let me tell you, you’re doing a fantastic job. I couldn’t be prouder.I recognize how difficult this is. It’s never easy to go on strike.  It’s a sacrifice.  Not just for you, but your entire family.  It takes tremendous courage.I’ve been there, my friends and neighbors, and brothers and sisters have been there.  I know what it takes, and I have your back.It’s not easy, but together we’re going to win.Verizon managers are playing the same old game.  But guess what?  We know how to play it better, and we’ll win because we stand for what’s right.  That’s what prevails in the end.  They’ll fight strong, but we’ll fight stronger.They’ll fight long, but we’ll fight longer, one day longer!We’ll stand together today, tomorrow, and as long as it takes to get a fair contract!God bless you, and God bless this picket line! © 2023 AFL-CIO.

334,Trumka to Steelworkers: You Know How to Win,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-steelworkers-you-know-how-win,4-25-2016,"Thank you, Brother Stan [Johnson].  But, listen, before we go on, let’s take a moment of silence to honor those men and women we have lost to workplace accidents or chronic diseases.God bless their memories.Sisters and brothers, I’m glad to be here, and I’m doubly glad all of you are here, too. Washington needs to hear from the Steelworkers.In a few days I’ll be in Indianapolis for a rally at Carrier.  The streets will be blocked off.  We’re going to shut down the whole city, because America is at a tipping point.We live in the richest country on the face of the earth.  Corporate profits are at record levels. We have more billionaires than ever before, yet a report came out last week showing wages have been flat as a pancake for 16 years.That hurts.  So of course we’re angry.  But we’re not blind with anger.  We know the issues.We know the difference between talk and action.  We know the power of unity and the pitfalls of division.We have got to be clear-eyed, because our jobs and wages and the future of our country are on the line, right now.  It’s time for us to step up in our communities and in this election season.So I look forward to joining the Steelworkers and thousands of other trade unionists and community members in Indianapolis.  And I am excited about all of the important fights ahead, including this election.  If we mobilize and we do our jobs, we will be stronger in the end.  I promise you that.Everywhere I go, I’ll be talking about trade, and I’ll be talking about politics.  I’m going to connect the dots.That’s what your Rapid Response program is all about.  You remind our elected officials that the rules they write have real-life consequences.You also remind them of the real-life political consequences of stacking the deck against working families.You see, our economy isn’t like the weather.  It doesn’t just happen.  The wind didn’t move 1,400 jobs to Mexico; Carrier took them there.  Our good manufacturing jobs haven’t disappeared out of thin air.  CEOs are making these choices because America’s trade and tax policies encourage them to.This rigged economic game is hurting America.  That’s why working people need to write the rules.We’re starting to do that, in large part thanks to you and your incredible Rapid Response team. We put the brakes on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Let me be crystal clear about something: We support trade.  What we oppose is bad trade deals that hurt workers.  The TPP is a bad deal. That’s why we’re fighting against it, and it’s our job, your job, to make sure every politician in Washington understands that if this thing comes up for a vote, we are going to kill it once and for all.  Enough is enough.The Steelworkers are a powerful union.  You organize and mobilize.  You know how and when to strike.  And no union is better at filing smart, strategic trade cases with the Department of Commerce.  It’s a shame you have to, but you’ve won more decisions than I can count.  I think you’ve got four cases going right now: hot-rolled steel, cold-rolled steel, corrosion-resistant steel and cut-to-length plate, if I’m not mistaken.You have also been relentless in the fight to create fairer and safer workplaces.  We need to keep pushing for the WAGE Act.  If an employer violates our right to organize, they should get more than just a slap on the wrist.  The WAGE Act will help ensure every worker has the right to join a union freely and fairly.With Workers Memorial Day coming up later this week, it is also long past time for Congress to pass the Protecting America’s Workers Act.  I appreciate your leadership on this.  As a former coal miner, workplace safety is personal to me.  I know this hits close to home for you too—especially in the paper industry.  Keeping workers safe is fundamental to our mission.  No one should have to risk their life to make a living.When you put it all together, it’s clear that the Steelworkers know how to build power.  You know how to use it.  The Steelworkers know how to win.I’ve been proud to stand alongside you.  The Steelworkers have been part of my life for over 50 years, ever since my father took me to my first picket line in Pennsylvania.When it came time for me to lead the Mine Workers, you were there.  And I have always stood strong with Steel.Brothers and sisters, that’s solidarity.We need solidarity today.  Working people want change, and the vultures are circling.  There is no denying that Donald Trump sees our members as his path to the presidency.  His rhetoric is tailored to people who are sick of an economy that works for the wealthy few.  To hammer home his point, Trump is playing on the worst fears and anxieties of working-class voters, many of them white.  We know this tactic.  We’ve seen it before.  Trump wants to divide this country in order to conquer it.  That’s the opposite of solidarity.When Trump mocks women or immigrants or Muslims, remember what he really means: He doesn’t believe in equality, and that’s a core American value.  Let that sink in for a moment. Donald Trump doesn’t share our core American values.In fact, all Trump cares about is money and power.Let me give you Trump in a nutshell: He says America’s wages are too high.  Your wages are too high.He says he’ll bring back steel.  He says he’ll bring back coal.  Baloney.  Remember, Trump supports right to work 100 percent.  You think he has any interest in fighting for us?  Trump would never take our trade cases seriously.  He would never invest in clean coal and other job-creating technologies.Here’s more: Trump won’t negotiate with union workers at his casino and hotel in Las Vegas. He won’t hire union at his construction project here in Washington.  And he wants to win working-class votes?Donald Trump is a dangerous, delusional demagogue.  He is unfit for America’s highest office.We will hold Trump accountable, but listen close: We will hold every candidate accountable.  We are the American labor movement.  We don’t work for any political party or any candidate. Our agenda drives our politics, not the other way around.We are and will remain focused on working people.  We are the main event, and it doesn’t matter whether we are Democrats, Republicans or anything in between.  We are shaping the debate and setting the terms of this election.We are ready to unleash the most comprehensive electoral program in AFL-CIO history.  Join us.  I’m asking you to be part of our shared campaign.  We need the Steelworkers on the front-lines.  In 2016 and beyond, let’s stand together.  Let’s fight together.  And let’s win together.There’s only one best way to build a middle class, and that’s with unionism.There’s only one best way to win change in a democracy, and that’s by mobilization.To do that, we’ve got to connect the dots, and that’s what I’m asking you to do.We’re building a movement in America.  We call it Raising Wages.  It’s a movement where workers write the economic rules.  A movement where unions grow and inequality shrinks.  It’s a movement where you can grab onto the American Dream no matter what you look like, where you come from, how much money your parents have or who you love.Because, by God, we’re building a better America from coast to coast.When it comes to doing right for working people, we define that vision.  We embody those values.  We are and will be the tip of the spear when it comes to fixing what’s broken in America.  We are the change-makers.We have unity.  We have solidarity.  And we are ready to win justice and jobs today, and a better tomorrow.We know the road up toward shared prosperity and a prosperous middle class—it’s the union highway, and it’s big enough for everyone who works for a living!God bless you and God bless the work you do!

335,Trumka to IBEW: American Labor Movement is Resilient,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-ibew-american-labor-movement-resilient,4-15-2016,"Thank you, Brother Jim [Ross], for your kind words of introduction.  It’s great to be with you. And let’s hear it for Sister Tammy Duckworth!  She’s as good as they come!  Let’s send Tammy to the Senate!As I begin my remarks, I want to say a few words about your brothers and sisters on strike at Verizon.  They are showing great courage and conviction by standing up to corporate greed. Verizon made $39 billion in profits over the last three years.  Yet management is asking for concessions on everything from retiree health care to job security.  Brothers and sisters, we are proud to make the companies we work for profitable.  But we deserve and demand a fair share of those profits.  So today I am here with a message for every striking IBEW and CWA member: the AFL-CIO has your back.On this fight and so many others, the IBEW has a great champion in your new president, Lonnie Stephenson.  One thing about my friend, Lonnie, you won’t see him hanging much around D.C.  He’s been spending time at IBEW locals all over North America, and that’s the mark of a true trade unionist.His predecessor, my close friend Ed Hill, was a giant among labor leaders.  I have no doubt that Lonnie will produce a legacy that’s just as powerful, inspiring and influential.  I’m proud to support him, to seek his counsel and to stand alongside him as he leads one the greatest unions on the planet.Sisters and brothers, join me in a round of applause for Lonnie Stephenson, for the IBEW and the future of organized labor!This is a good time to be a trade unionist in America.The right-wing is out for our blood, because they know every worker in America will be better off with a collectively bargained contract.  They know if you are financially insecure, we are your best friend.  They want you to struggle, and they know we can lift you up.  And they recognize we are the last line of defense against a corporate takeover of America.Every family, every community, every city and every state will be stronger as more workers win a voice on the job.  As that message spreads, our movement will continue to grow.  That’s why our opponents are doing everything they can to tear us down.They can’t stop us, though, because the American labor movement is resilient.  You can see it in the numbers.  Here’s a headline that ran in newspapers all across this country—and I quote—“Despite Attacks on Labor, Public Support of Unions is Growing.”I’ll explain.  You’ve heard of the Gallup organization; they’ve been doing polls on labor for more than a century.  In the latest poll, nearly 60% support unions, compared to 37% against us. I can’t wait to see the next poll, because I can feel the momentum on our side.Together, our unions are showing America the way forward.  The IBEW has been doing it for years, with your focus on excellence.  You’re the best trained, best equipped and safest workforce there is, and the proof is in everything you do.We’re showing the way forward with good old fashioned organizing.  IBEW membership has gone up each of the last 2 years.  You’ve brought more workers into the ranks and increased market share in key industries.We’re showing the way by continuing to bargain contracts with family-sustaining wages and benefits.  I want to give a shout out to your Minnesota brothers and sisters in construction who recently won a powerful 3-year deal with paid breaks and a combined $5.75 hourly raise.  That’s a win!Let me tell you, we’re showing the way by winning on Capitol Hill, too.  We were happy to delay the excise tax, but we’re not stopping until it’s dead.  Nobody should be penalized for negotiating quality health care.  Nobody!We are also committed to ending the era of corporate trade deals that ship our jobs overseas.  I want to thank each and every one of you for your great work to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  The TPP has become so toxic that virtually every remaining presidential candidate opposes it and Congress doesn’t have the votes to pass it.  Let’s keep the pressure on.  Let’s keep demanding fair trade that lifts families up.  And if the TPP ever comes up for a vote, let’s kill it once and for all.And finally, we’re showing the way in this year’s elections.  Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have been fighting hard and hashing out real issues, and I like what I’ve seen: Good candidates getting better.  Unions have been front and center as a key to raising wages and expanding opportunity.  Issues of social and economic justice have been debated passionately.  It is clear to me that both Clinton and Sanders would make a great president and no matter which Democrat wins, labor would have a seat at the table.There’s a reason for this.  We are the ones setting the agenda!  We are the ones defining what the economic rules should be, and who should write them!We’re building a movement in America.  We call it Raising Wages.  It’s a movement where unions grow and inequality shrinks.  A movement where you can grab onto the American Dream no matter what you look like, where you come from, how much money your parents have or who you love.  We are and will continue to be the tip of the spear when it comes to fixing what’s broken in America.  We are the change-makers.We know the road toward shared prosperity and a prosperous middle class, it’s the union highway, and it’s big enough for everyone who works for a living!Sisters and brothers, after this conference when you go back to your local unions, I want you to do something for me.  I want you to explain to your members, and especially the younger ones, the importance of being engaged in politics, and talk to them about the difference between actual power and perceived power.You see, we’re building actual power in politics and in the workplace, real power, and we’re going to keep doing it.  That means every single one of your members, especially the young ones, need to be registered to vote.  We must also give them the space to be honest, to talk through any reservations they have about our political programs.  It’s OK to have questions.  It’s OK to be skeptical, but it’s not OK to be absent.Perceived power is just that, perception.  We can’t worry about not getting the respect we deserve.  It’s our job to keep doing what works.  And this year, that means we need your political programs to be as engaged and strong as they’ve ever been.  I know they will be, because the IBEW always steps up to the fight.And let me tell you, it will be a fight.  We’ve got political opponents who are as bad as any we’ve ever seen.Just look at Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.  Trump’s rhetoric has tapped into the very real and very justified anger of everyday people.  But here are the facts.  Trump loves right to work.  He routinely mistreats workers at his own companies.  He cheered Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker’s attacks on teachers and nurses, and thinks he’d be a good Vice President.  And Trump says our wages are too high.  Let me repeat that: he says our wages are too high.The real Donald Trump gets too little attention, and that’s why we’ve got to constantly expose him for what he is: dangerous, delusional and a demagogue, racist, misogynist and anti-union.  Any one of these flaws disqualifies him from being president.Trump and Cruz are the ugly face of today’s Republican Party, which is why its leaders are calling for someone, anyone, to get them out of their mess.  But there is no escape.Trump and Cruz are symptoms of a party in disarray.  Responsible Republicans have run for the hills, chased away by a growing radical element who believes governing is surrender.We will hold accountable whoever comes out of this Republican primary, and we’ll do the same straight down the ticket.  We’re going to hold Democrats’ feet to the fire, too, because our agenda drives our politics, not the other way around.As labor leaders, we know how to connect the dots.  We know our politics relates directly to organizing and bargaining wins.  We know the men and women we elect will impact the future of Davis-Bacon and PLAs.  And we know how a strong national economy built on shared prosperity means more and better work for the IBEW.The future of America is not with the Wall Street or Washington elite.  It’s in our towns, cities and communities.  It’s in the places where we live and work.When we win, America wins.  When we rise, America rises, and the middle class expands.  And a virtuous cycle of investment and growth and jobs takes hold.This is how we win a better life.  And it all comes back to solidarity, real solidarity, IBEW solidarity, where your picket line is my picket line.  Where I stand with you, and you stand with me.  When we stand together and march together and win together!Brothers and sisters, the IBEW is a power in the workplace and in electoral politics.  You know firsthand that working people aren’t asking for the world. We want to be paid well and treated with respect.  We want to have a say on things like our schedules and working conditions. We want a fair share of the profits we help create and every opportunity to live a better life.  We want equal pay and safe jobs.  We don’t want our boss to define what kind of life we have. That’s for us to do.  That’s what we’re standing together for.  That’s what we’re fighting for.  And that’s what we’re going to win.It comes down to dignity and what’s fair.  So get off your seat and on your feet.  We’ll hit the worksites and walk the streets.  Because we’re the ones who wake America up every single day, and we put her to bed at night.  We do what it takes.  We answer the call, and by God we’ll make America work again for the people who work.God bless you, and God bless the work you do!

336,Trumka: Labor Educators Make Enormous Impact,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-labor-educators-make-enormous-impact,4-14-2016,"What a great video.  John Legend is inspiring millions through his music and his activism.  We are extremely grateful that he is partnering with labor to end mass incarceration.Brothers and sisters, thank you all for being here, and for your leadership.  As labor educators, whether you work in a union or not, you have an enormous impact on the future of the American labor movement.I want to thank all of the UALE officers, including your president and AFT Education Director Cheryl Teare, for building a strong association of union, community and university-based labor educators. 
I also want to thank those who will speak on the panel after me, AFT Secretary-Treasurer Dr. Loretta Johnson, our own AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Tefere Gebre, Dr. Steven Pitts of the UC Berkeley Labor Center and CJ Jenkins, a young activist from Baltimore and a member of the Postal Workers Union.  I know we’re all looking forward to hearing your perspectives.At the AFL-CIO, we are delighted to be a part of UALE and pleased to have our Leadership Development Director Al Davidoff serve as a Vice President.The AFL-CIO continues to be committed to education and leadership development.  We are proud to be partnering with top notch educational institutions all across America -- Cornell, Penn State, Rutgers, Harvard, UMass, UCLA, Illinois, Oregon and many others, on our National Labor Leadership Initiative.  These are powerful and effective collaborations.  Also, we are excited to offer Common Sense Economics to hundreds of thousands of workers and community partners.  Your help delivering this program is essential, and I thank you for it. Let’s do more, everywhere we can.  Everyone should understand how our economy is a set of man-made rules, not some act of nature.  We have the power to change our economy and make it work for the working class.  That message will help us defeat the poisonous ideas from the corporate right-wing, whether it’s on talk radio, or from anti-worker politicians like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.No matter what candidate, or what election, America cannot afford to embrace racism and division.  We must reject it, and that’s a big part of what I want to talk about with you today.As a movement, we are evolving in a hundred ways.  We’re growing stronger.  I won’t get deeply into the nuts and bolts of that evolution, but I do want to acknowledge it.  We’re breaking new ground.  And we’re experimenting with new ways to build solidarity, including addressing issues of racial justice head on, both inside the labor movement and in society.We can’t face the easy stuff and ignore the hard things.  We won’t sit comfortably in the middle of the pack.  We are committed to being the tip of the spear.  Let’s be honest.  Race is a subject that makes a lot of people, black, white, all of us, uncomfort-able, or even resentful.All of this can put people on their heels, and honestly we sometimes hear ignorant or insensitive comments from essentially good people.  That’s OK, as long as we continue to evolve, to listen to each other and to come together.We are committed to finding ways to be more inclusive, from training stewards to choosing local ballot initiatives to enlisting apprentices.  All workers must play a role in pushing our labor movement forward.  Anything less fails the test of this moment.Brothers and sisters, I reject the idea that placing a value on one life diminishes the value of another.  In fact, the reverse is true.  Let me speak clearly about exactly what I mean: Anyone who says #blacklivesmatter is against anyone is wrong.  #Blacklivesmatter is for all of us.As a movement, our doors are open to everyone.  We’re open to new immigrants in search of a better life for themselves and their families.  We’re open to all working class folks who are being left behind in today’s economy.  We accept everybody, we need everybody, and when it comes to continuing our shift toward a more inclusive, respectful and broader labor movement, we won’t give up one damn inch.We will be a movement that fights systemic injustices that hurt all working people, like mass incarceration.  We will continue this shift, because it is toward a labor movement that grows, a labor movement that wins and a labor movement that raises wages for workers all across this country, whatever we look like, whoever we love, however we worship and wherever we live.America is stratified by race and income more than ever before.  Every day, we see economic inequality and uncertainty feeding the divisions among us.  These divisions are very real, and very dangerous.  And they are being stoked by those who wish to profit from them, without any concern for the damage it is doing to our beloved country.The truth is, Wall Street doesn’t give a damn what color we are.  The only color they see is green.  Their only motivator is greed.They want us to be divided, to knock us down and make us poor, and they’ve been doing a pretty good job of it.But it’s never been equal opportunity poverty.  There are always some who are worse off, who are knocked down harder and kept down longer.And that distinction makes all the difference.That’s why it’s so important for us to listen to each other, to hold onto the things that lift us up and throw away the ideas that tear us apart.  When Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri, that day when our brother killed our sister’s son, and when our sister’s son lay in the street in a pool of his own drying blood for hours and hours, America saw vividly how cheap some lives have become.In response, a national movement for equality and justice has risen up from the streets of Ferguson.  It is rising from New York City and Oakland, Cleveland, Chicago, Tallahassee, Birmingham, Dallas and hundreds of other cities and towns across this country.  It is lifting all of us up.I can speak about this with authority, because, for more than a year, we’ve been holding forums on race from coast to coast.  We’ve had real and candid conversations with working people. We’ve listened.  And we’ve learned from each other.  Our affiliate unions and community allies, along with our team from the AFL-CIO Civil and Human Rights Department, have all made this possible.We’ve held workshops on a wide range of subjects: implicit bias, dog-whistle politics, mass incarceration, and more.  Thousands of labor folks have begun the education and training process to move us forward.Our challenge and your challenge is to ramp this program up.  Help us engage our members and our communities on issues of racial justice and equality.This is tough and complicated, and we all have to be committed to this process.  We are working to provide a range of tools to advance and deepen these conversations about race, and to lay out the steps we need to create a more just society.If you have good ideas, exercises you’ve found successful, or really anything that would add to our growing curriculum, please share them with Carmen Berkley or Al Davidoff. Our collective knowledge and experience is a tremendous resource.  We certainly don’t pretend to have all the answers, but we do want to pull the best ideas together and then provide the most effective tools and options for tackling this vital work.Race and justice are not side projects of the AFL-CIO.  These are at the core of who we are as a labor movement now and in the future.Brothers and sisters, each of you has the capacity to change a union, a community.  You stand at the gate, and that’s a tremendous responsibility.  You know how hard this work can be, and you know how important it is.  This transformation will keep us unified and enhance the strength we need so badly.Strength to organize.  Strength to grow.  Strength to win in the workplace and on Election Day.As I like to say, if some is good, more is better.  We want more.  We want better.  We want raising wages.  We want justice.  We want equality.  We want a better tomorrow!Thank you so much.  God bless you and the work you do.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
337,Trumka to Utility Workers: The Only Way to Go is Up ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-utility-workers-only-way-go,4-13-2016,"Good morning, everyone.  Brother Mike [Langford], thank you for that introduction.  It is great to be here.  If you don’t mind, I’d like today to be more of a conversation than a speech.  For you, this is an executive board meeting.  For me, it is a focus group of some of the best labor leaders in the country.  I look forward to hearing your ideas and experiences.The Utility Workers are a union of great heart and passion.  You are a source of power for working people, both literally and figuratively.  You are the first responders in times of crisis. You take on each challenge with courage and conviction.  And you help families from coast to coast build better lives.I have always felt a special bond with this union.  As you know, I grew up in southwestern Pennsylvania and followed my father and grandfather into the mines.  We didn’t have a lot of money.  But we were rich in the things that matter most: faith, family and community.The work was tough.  It was dangerous.  But because my grandfather had the security of a union contract, he was able to give my father a better life.  And my father was able to do the same for me.  That’s what the American Dream is all about.Sustaining and expanding this dream is what drives me every day.  It’s why I got involved with the United Mine Workers of America.  And it’s what brought me to the AFL-CIO.  For those of us who have the honor of working in the labor movement, success is not judged by how much money we make.  It’s about the difference we make in people’s lives.Mine workers and utility workers have different jobs, but we share common values.  Toughness. Grit.  Sacrifice.  Solidarity.  Over time, each of our unions have endured setbacks in the pursuit of fairness on the job.  But we have always emerged stronger and more united.  Through blood and sweat, we helped create the greatest middle class the world has ever known.Along the way, the corporate right-wing has never stopped trying to push us down.  First, there were company unions.  That gave way to goon squads and beatings.  Taft-Hartley became the law of the land.  And Ronald Reagan used his presidency to mercilessly attack working people.Today our enemies are even more sophisticated.  Under the guise of free markets, they are spending billions of dollars to ram through right to work, deregulation and other trickle down policies.  Their goal is nothing less than the total destruction of the labor movement.That’s what’s at stake in 2016.  We are the last line of defense against billionaires and corporations taking over America.The road ahead will be long.  It will be hard.  But we have no intention of backing down.Working people are not asking for the world.  We want to be paid well and treated with respect.  We want to have some control over our schedules and working conditions.  We want a fair piece of the profits we help create and every opportunity to live a better life.  Not a life defined by our boss, but one we decide on. Unfortunately, CEOs have profited from four decades of our rising productivity, leaving us with flat wages and financial insecurity.  I’m sure you’ve seen the charts, but this is not an intellectual exercise.  We feel it.  We’ve seen it play out in the lives of our family and friends, union and non-union alike, white collar and blue collar.Many Americans are upset.  Who can blame them?  Sixty-three percent say they don’t have enough savings to cover a $500 car repair or a $1,000 medical bill.  A majority of workers are living paycheck to paycheck.  We live in the richest country in the world, yet a growing number of us are struggling to afford basic necessities.This anxiety has created an opening for Donald Trump, and it’s easy for him to tap into the very real and very justified anger people are feeling.But we can’t be fooled.  Trump isn’t interested in solving the problems he yells and swears about.  He delivers punch lines, but there’s nothing funny about them.Trump says he would make America great again, but in reality he would double down on a generation of broken economic rules.  He is on record claiming that outsourcing creates jobs.  He thinks corporate raider Carl Icahn, who made his fortune destroying pensions and union contracts, would make a good Treasury Secretary.  And given Trump’s background, there is little doubt he would speed up consolidation of the utility industry at the expense of workers and consumers alike. When it comes to unions, the picture gets even worse.  Trump loves right to work.  He cheered Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker’s attacks on teachers and nurses.  And he says our wages are too high.  Let me repeat that: he says our wages are too high.Brothers and sisters, we’ve got to expose Donald Trump for what he truly is: dangerous, delusional and a demagogue, racist, misogynist and anti-union.  Someone with one of these characteristics, let alone all, has no business being president.Holding Trump accountable is imperative, but we also must stay focused on our own agenda. Working people are the main event, and it doesn’t matter whether we are Democrats, Republicans or anything in between.  We are shaping the debate and setting the terms of this election.Our labor movement puts issues first.  Our agenda drives our politics, not the other way around. In Washington, there is an assumption that unions and Republicans can’t work together.  I reject that wholeheartedly.  For decades, the party of Teddy Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower played a serious and constructive role on issues of work and family.  And we’ve worked with moderate Republicans from Pennsylvania to Missouri to beat back anti-worker initiatives.That’s why it is so disappointing that not a single Republican running for president supports our issues. Let’s be honest, Democrats haven’t always been a picnic, either.  But this primary has been different.  With our encouragement, the candidates are putting forth real ideas for growing an economy that works for workers.  Unions have been front and center as a key to raising wages and expanding opportunity.  Issues of social and economic justice have been debated passionately.We’ve got to keep that momentum up, because our opposition never rests.For one thing, the right-wing Koch Brothers are copying our playbook.  They aren’t just running TV ads anymore.  They’re recruiting volunteers to knock doors and phone bank as if they were an actual grassroots organization.  It’s up to us to beat them to the punch!With utility workers on the frontlines, we are preparing to unleash the most comprehensive electoral program in our history.  We know how to run these campaigns.  We know how to win.  One of the most powerful tools in the union box is the conversations we have with our members.We’re going to talk to each and every one of them.  At home.  On the phone.  And in the worksite.  I want to encourage you to make these conversations a priority.  Talk to your members before work, after work and on breaks.  Use stewards conferences and other gatherings to drive the message home.  And let’s make sure we lead with issues.This is how we win a better life.  And it all comes back to solidarity, real solidarity, where your picket line is my picket line.  Where I stand with you, and you stand with me.  When we stand together, we win together!Brothers and sisters, we need that solidarity now more than ever.  We need it to make our workplaces as safe as possible.  As you may know, last week Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship was sentenced to a year in jail.  I know Blankenship.  He is a bad guy.  Fifty-two miners needlessly lost their lives on his watch.  One year for murder, that makes me sick.  It’s only one week for every life lost.  Let’s use this tragedy to strengthen our mine safety laws so no one dies in the name of corporate greed. We need solidarity to stop corporate trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Supporters of the TPP thought it would be a slam dunk.  But working people are winning the debate on trade.We need solidarity to make long overdue investments in our infrastructure.  Clean coal, broad-band, renewables, and yes, clean water.  You know better than anyone what happened in Flint is just the tip of the iceberg.  We need a massive federal commitment to rebuilding America.  I’m talking trillions with a T.And we need solidarity to help drive a sensible and fair national energy policy.  Your president Mike Langford and I recently participated in a meeting of the International Trade Union Confederation which focused on this important issue.  I wish you all could have been there.  Mike did an incredible job advocating on our behalf.When it comes to energy, Mike and I are in lockstep.  We believe clean air is a public good that must be preserved for future generations.  We believe public policy should benefit our economy and our environment.  And we believe it is irresponsible to reduce carbon emissions on the backs of hard-working families.The energy sector is undergoing a transformation.  Done right, we get good family-sustaining jobs.  We get growth in union membership, and the political power that comes with it.  We get affordable, reliable energy, cleaner air and a healthier climate.Done wrong, we get more bad jobs, more union busting, and more families wondering what happened to their standard of living.  Let me be clear, we cannot let changes in energy become another excuse to push workers down.We are going to fight for a concept called “just transition,” something I know you are familiar with.  To me, just transition is a good job that can sustain a family.  No more fancy funerals like Trade Adjustment Assistance.  Instead, we should train workers for the jobs on the future and build on the strengths of local and regional economies—whether it’s a medical system or a university.Above all, just transition must be defined by workers.  If we are going to survive and thrive in a rapidly changing economy, we have to know what we want and how to get it.  I am committed to working with you to make that happen.You see, the future of America is not with the Wall Street or Washington elite.  The future is in our towns, cities and communities.  It’s in coal mines and power plants.  It’s in the places where we live and work.Brothers and sisters, we’re standing at a crossroads.  Down one path is more corporate greed and the ruins of a once-great American middle class.  Up the other is the solidarity highway.  It’s built on integrity and unionism, and the deep truth that we are in fact created equal, born with certain inalienable rights, to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.We know the only way to go is up.  This is a year for the labor movement to define America for the ages.  So let’s do it!  Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless the work you do!

338,"Trumka to Pennsylvania AFL-CIO Delegates: When We Rise, America Rises",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-pennsylvania-afl-cio-delegates-when-we-rise-america-rises,4-5-2016,"Good morning, brothers and sisters.  It’s great to be home in Pennsylvania.Thank you, Brother Rick [Bloomingdale] for your generous words of introduction.  I appreciate your friendship and your service to working people.  I also want to thank Frank Snyder, a trade unionist to his core and a great champion for social and economic justice.  Working together, Rick and Frank are moving the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO forward, finding powerful new ways to build reliable partnerships on everything from political campaigns to contract fights.And I don’t know if any local labor movement in America is as strong and influential as the Philadelphia Council.  President Pat Eiding, you’re creative.  You’re compelling.  You’re effective.  Your record of success speaks for itself.  Whether it’s helping elect a mayor who puts workers first, leading the fight against employers that steal our wages, or forging the alliances that lead to organizing wins, thousands of families in Philadelphia are living the union advantage because of your leadership.Here in Philly and across Pennsylvania, we’re bringing new members into our ranks. When I moderated an organizing discussion at your last convention in 2014, I stressed that even without major labor law reform, it is possible to wage successful campaigns. You ran with that. You have fully embraced strategic organizing and it is starting to pay off.Just listen to this.  Last year, in some of the toughest conditions for organizing imaginable, Pennsylvania increased its union membership by approximately 50,000 workers.  Give yourselves a hand.It’s not just organizing.  We’re winning contract fights, too.  I want to specifically applaud the solidarity each of you showed for locked out workers at Allegheny Technologies.  The fight was long.  It was hard.  But because we stood together, our members are back on the job with a new four-year contract.The same solidarity that worked at ATI is also making waves on the international stage.  And believe me, we will need every ounce of that solidarity to stop the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.  This state bears the scars of unfair trade.  From Beaver Falls to Bethlehem.  From Monaca to McKeesport.  We’ve seen the shuttered factories and dying towns.  We’ve felt the lost jobs, stagnant wages and devastated communities.  When we fight against corporate trade deals, we are fighting for the future of Pennsylvania.I want to thank each and every one of you for your great work on this issue.  Working people have helped move the needle on trade in this country.  The TPP has become so toxic that virtually every remaining presidential candidate opposes it and House Speaker Paul Ryan admits he does not have the votes to pass it.  Let’s keep the pressure on.  Let’s keep demanding fair trade that lifts families up.  And if the TPP ever comes up for a vote, let’s kill it once and for all.On the TPP and so much more, we are using solidarity to stand strong in the face of outrageous attacks from the corporate right-wing.  Earlier this year, those attacks hit a new low when special interests took a case called Friedrichs to the Supreme Court.  Well brothers and sisters, last week the Court came back with its decision, and it was a win for working people!  While we celebrate that victory today, we stand ready for the fights of tomorrow.Right here in Pennsylvania, extremist legislators are pushing a dangerous agenda that attacks public education, strips retirement security, privatizes our jobs and destroys collective bargaining.  They are also trying to eliminate unemployment benefits and undercut workers comp.  This is not the Pennsylvania I know and love.  So we are going to stand strong with Governor Wolf and beat back these attacks on working families.You see, we are not asking for the world.  We want to be paid well and treated with respect.  We want to have a say on things like our schedules and working conditions.  We want a fair share of the profits we help create and every opportunity to live a better life.  Not a life defined by our boss, but one we decide on.  That’s what we’re standing together for.  That’s what we’re fighting for.  And that’s what we’re going to win.We have a big year ahead of us in the battle for a better life.  In a few short months, when the Democratic National Convention comes here, the eyes of America will be focused squarely on Philadelphia.This city is the cradle of American liberty, the birthplace of our nation.It’s our job to make sure the convention embodies our working family vision, and our working family values.  Labor can’t be in the middle of the pack.  We have to be the tip of the spear when it comes to fixing what’s broken in America.  We are the change-makers.Two hundred and forty years after American democracy took hold here in Philadelphia, another movement is rising.  We call it Raising Wages.  It’s a movement where workers write the economic rules.  A movement where unions grow and inequality shrinks.A movement where you can grab onto the American Dream no matter what you look like, where you come from or who you love.That is the movement we are building.No more business as usual.  Our issues and our power and our values will carry the day.  We want unity.  We want solidarity.  We want justice and jobs today, and a better tomorrow.We know the road to shared prosperity and a prosperous middle class.It’s the union highway, and it’s big enough for everyone who works for a living!Mark my words: 2016 will be remembered as the year we assert our power.Working people have been pushed aside, knocked down and rolled over for 40 years, and we have had enough. Look how easy it’s been for Donald Trump to tap into the very real and very justified anger of everyday people.  Sixty-three percent of Americans say they don’t have enough savings to cover a $500 car repair or a $1,000 medical bill.  A majority of workers in this country are living paycheck to paycheck.So when Trump says we’re losing, he finds a sympathetic audience who wishes more politicians would express the frustration they feel every day.But we can’t be fooled.  Trump isn’t interested in solving the problems he yells and swears about.  He delivers punch lines, but there’s nothing funny about them.Here are some facts.  Trump loves right to work.  He routinely mistreats workers at his own companies.  He cheered Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker’s attacks on teachers and nurses.  And he says our wages are too high.  Let me repeat that: he says our wages are too high.These facts get too little attention, and that’s why we’ve got to constantly expose Donald Trump for what he is: dangerous, delusional and a demagogue.Holding Trump accountable is imperative, but we also must stay focused on our own agenda. Working people are the main event, and it doesn’t matter whether we are Democrats, Republicans or anything in between.  We are shaping the debate and setting the terms of this election.Our labor movement puts issues first.  Our agenda drives our politics, not the other way around. In Washington, there is an assumption that unions and Republicans can’t work together.  I reject that wholeheartedly.  For decades, the party of Teddy Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower played a serious and constructive role on issues of work and family.  Even today in Pennsylvania, moderate Republicans are standing with us to block the anti-worker efforts of their more conservative colleagues.That’s why it is so disappointing that not a single Republican running for president supports our issues.  What happened to the Grand Old Party?Let’s be honest, Democrats haven’t always been a picnic, either, sometimes breaking promises and embracing half measures instead of bold, progressive solutions.  But this primary has been different.  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are running one of the most uplifting and substantive campaigns of my lifetime.  With our encouragement, I know both will be here this week.  The candidates are putting forth real ideas for growing an economy that works for workers.  Unions have been front and center as a key to raising wages and expanding opportunity.  Issues of social and economic justice have been debated passionately.  And the contest has largely been conducted with a degree of civility and dignity too often missing in politics today.We’ve got to keep that momentum up, keep it moving.  We have a chance to permanently change the conversation.The future of America is not with the Wall Street or Washington elite.  It’s not bad trade deals and corporate giveaways like the TPP.The future is in our towns, cities and communities.  It’s on the ground in Philadelphia.  It’s in Pennsylvania and all the places where we live and work.When we rise, America rises.  The middle class expands.  And a virtuous cycle of investment and growth and jobs takes hold.This is how we win a better life.  And it all comes back to solidarity, real solidarity, Pennsylvania solidarity, where your picket line is my picket line.  Where I stand with you, and you stand with me.  When we stand together and march together, we win together!Over the past several years, we’ve seen a change come across this country.  Working people are standing up, and our unions have been on the cutting edge every step of the way.  It’s time for us to take another big step forward.We are trying new tactics, and this year in Pennsylvania we will do more—much more—to guarantee success for working families.  We are growing our partnerships and strengthening our alliances to build a stronger ground game.  And you can see the results right here: a pro-worker mayor of Philadelphia, a pro-worker governor and three pro-worker state Supreme Court justices.  We’ve made significant progress, but we need more.  For one thing, the right-wing Koch Brothers are copying our playbook.  They aren’t just running TV ads anymore.  They’re recruiting volunteers to knock doors and phone bank as if they were an actual grassroots organization.  It’s up to us to beat them to the punch!I know Rick and Frank have been traveling the commonwealth for months, preparing to unleash a comprehensive 2016 electoral program.  We know how to run these campaigns.  We know how to win.  One of the most powerful tools in the union box is the conversations we have with our members, and our members have with each other and the public.We’re going to talk to our members.  At home.  On the phone.  And in the worksite.  I want to encourage you as officers, stewards and activists to make these conversations a priority.  Talk to your members before work, after work and on breaks.  Use stewards conferences and other gatherings to drive the message home.  And let’s make sure we lead with issues instead of politics.We are committed to building on our successes, learning from our failures and expanding our footprint.  That means more experimentation, more cooperation, more integrated efforts.  I love what I’ve seen from Working America in Pennsylvania.  I appreciate your efforts to send volunteers into our national program.  Keep it up.  We need to be talking to union members and our neighbors.  The fact is our neighbors—the folks next door—have the same issues as we do, and we need to have these conversations with them!  This is the road to winning majorities for working families.You send the volunteers.  We’ll set up the structure, so we can do it legally and do it right.  I want to set your minds at ease.  There won’t be a problem.  We did it in Philly and other places around the country, and we can do it across Pennsylvania!Let’s work together to elect a state legislature that stands up for raising wages.  Let’s replace Pat Toomey with someone who will actually do their job, like giving President Obama’s nominee to the Supreme Court fair consideration.  And let’s make sure this state delivers the White House to a president who will fight for us every single day.  We know what to do, and we know why we do it.
It comes down to dignity and what’s fair.  So get off your seat and on your feet.  We’ll be going out the door and to the street.  Because we’re the ones who wake America up every single day, and we put her to bed at night.  We lift the loads and make the steel.  We run the plant and teach the school.  We drive the bus and build the roads.  We do what it takes.  We answer the call, and by God we’ll make America work again for the people who work. God bless you, and God bless the work you do!

339,Trumka to Transport Workers: Unions Give Us a Voice,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-transport-workers-unions-give-us-voice,3-8-2016,"Thank you, Brother Harry [Lombardo], for your kind words of introduction.  I’m glad to be with each and every one of you.The TWU has such an incredibly diverse membership, from public transit to aviation, from railroads to universities, utilities, service and gaming, from Philly to Miami, Ann Arbor to Omaha, San Francisco to New York City.  You’re everywhere.Your jobs, held up and maintained by your union contracts, make you an integral part of your local and regional economies.  When you prosper, your communities share in that prosperity. American workers are American consumers, and consumer spending makes up 70 percent of our economy.  That’s why the saying is true, that a rising tide lifts all boats.When working people rise, America rises.  When we fall, America is left high and dry.We know the best way to win raises is a union contract.  It’s the best answer when you’re looking for good health care and a secure retirement.  But it’s more than that.  Our unions give us a voice.We use our voice to challenge the bosses, who threaten to fire us for speaking up.  We use it to hold politicians accountable when they fail to deliver on their promises.  And we use it to confront those like South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam, who unapologetically violate federal law in their quest to destroy unions.  We use our collective voice on the job, in our communities, at the ballot box and in the halls of power. Let me tell you something: America needs that collective voice now more than ever.  We need the TWU and all the unions of our labor movement, because we’re standing at a crossroads. Down one path is division and isolation, and the ruins of a once-great American middle class.  Up the other path is the solidarity highway.  It’s built on integrity and unionism, and the deep truth that we are in fact created equal, born with certain inalienable rights, to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.Brothers and sisters, we know where we have to go.  And we know who’s got to lead: America’s working people.Our country is in the midst of a historic presidential primary season.  We’ve seen inspiring ideas brought forward by some of the candidates, and we’ve also heard the ugliest and most divisive rhetoric imaginable.  On the Republican side, we’ve been exposed to hate-filled claims that are flat-out un-American, like the offensive notion that certain people are somehow better or worth more than others.  Under the guise of “speaking their mind,” candidates for the highest office in the land have tried to push racism and bigotry into the mainstream.  It’s truly frightening.Brothers and sisters, we won’t stand back while this kind of trash is being thrown around.  We’ll raise our voices now, and by God we’ll mobilize to make them count on Election Day.I want every single one of you to get your members registered.  Register your families, your neighbors, your friends and relatives.  We’ve got to spread the word.  When the time is right, I want your members pounding the pavement, knocking doors, leafletting worksites, meeting with workers and families, and turning out the vote, because we need progress in America for working people and we need it now!We need it now because CEOs have profited from four decades of our rising productivity, leaving us with flat wages and financial insecurity.  I’m sure you’ve seen the charts, but this is not an intellectual exercise.  We’ve felt it.  We’ve seen this national story play out in the lives of our family and friends, union and non-union alike, white collar and blue collar.During contract negotiations and election years, our members want us to analyze the facts, to explain what the bad guys are doing, and suggest a path forward.But our members also look to us to see what’s possible, for a positive vision of where we can be, where we will be, when we stand together.Working people everywhere are realizing that the only organized voice for our interests is us.  It’s the American labor movement.This is important because we are not the only ones speaking to working families.One of the loudest voices in America today is Donald Trump.  He’s compelling.  And he’s dangerous.Donald Trump is tapping into the very real and very understandable anger of working people.  In a national survey last month, 63 percent of Americans said they don’t have enough savings to cover a $500 car repair, or a $1,000 medical bill.  A majority of people in this country are living paycheck to paycheck.  It’s a precarious way to live.  A car accident or an illness spells disaster.So when Trump says we’re losing, his message resonates with some folks.  And when he yells or lashes out, he finds a sympathetic audience who wishes more politicians would express the frustration they feel in their hearts.Listen, I know realdown-home talk when I hear it, and I know a load of baloney and bluster, too, and I don’t think I have to tell you that Trump is full of baloney and bluster.He is also a bigot.  From his anti-American proposal to ban Muslims to his horrendous comments about women and immigrants, Trump is running on hate.  It seems the only group he won’t criticize is the KKK.Those statements and positions are bad enough.  But what’s getting less attention is how Donald Trump really feels about working people.  That is the untold story of this campaign, a story we must share with our members and all working people. First, Trump loves right to work.  He said it is “better for the people” and his position is “100 percent.”  Meanwhile, he is fighting tooth and nail against workers at his hotel in Las Vegas. Second, Trump was a major financial backer of Governor Scott Walker.  Enough said. Finally, and most disturbingly, Trump says our wages are already too high.  Can you believe that?  Trump has also said outsourcing creates jobs in the long run.  He is advocating the exact opposite of our raising wages agenda.Just look at who Trump would tap to lead the American economy: a billionaire named Carl Icahn, a corporate raider who made a fortune using bankruptcy to destroy pensions and end union contracts.  He did it at TWA.  He wrecked the pensions of your brothers and sisters.  He bled that airline dry, and walked away with $500 million.  That’s who Trump wants to make his Treasury Secretary!You see, Trump says he’s with the American working class, but when you look close, it’s just hot air.America needs a truth-telling moment.  Here it is: The answer to our nation’s challenges isn’t anger and division.  It’s raising wages.  And the best way to raise wages is through collective action and collective bargaining.When we look up and down the American landscape, we see a lot to love and plenty to fix.  It all starts with unity, by standing together with like-minded allies and friends.  We’re going to fight for a higher minimum wage, expanded overtime pay, paid sick leave and fair work schedules.We’re going to fight for our immigrant brothers and sisters, until we win comprehensive reform. We’re going to fight to turn back bad trade deals, and let me tell you, we’re going to win!  We’re going to fight to end the era of outsourcing so no more workers have to apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance.  EVER!We’ll fight to win labor law reform like the WAGE Act, so working people everywhere can join our proud movement and get a union contract!And while we’re at it, we’ll push each and every obstructionist senator to fulfill their constitutional duty to hold hearings and vote on the nomination of a new justice to the U.S. Supreme Court!There is nothing we can’t accomplish when we work together.In the labor movement, we know it’s the UNITED States of America.  United we stand. Or divided we beg.This is a year for the American labor movement to stand up as the leaders we are.  This is the year we define America for the ages.What kind of a country will we be?  Will we retreat from each challenge, and sneak back into hatred and fear?  Or will we stand strong on our values?I know the answer to that question.  I know what we’re made of.  We stand together in solidarity, and we’re going to show America how to stand up, too.I’m proud of our unionism.  How we come together in the good times, and how we stay together when it’s hard.Brothers and sisters, let’s stand together for raising wages, for a better America and a better tomorrow.  Let’s march together.  Let’s organize together.  Let’s register together.  Let’s vote together.  And let’s win together.Thank you, and God bless you.

340,Trumka to Plasterers and Cement Masons: What Kind of Country Will We Be?,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-plasterers-and-cement-masons-what-kind-country-will-we-be,3-3-2016,"Brother Pat [Finley], thank you for your words of introduction.  I’m honored to be here.The Plasterers and Cement Masons are a proud union.  You are a powerful voice for your members and families, for your trade, for working people in America, and for this great country of ours.The work you and your members do is hard.  It isn’t for everybody.  It’s challenging, both physically and mentally, which is why it’s so important you run some of the best training and apprenticeship programs anywhere.  You are true leaders in every sense of the word.I especially want to commend you for your commitment to our veterans.  Your involvement with Helmets to Hardhats is second to none, and you’ve all heard this before, but it bears repeating, you have one of the proudest military connections in our labor movement.  After the Civil War, your members returned fresh from America’s bloodiest battlefields to rebuild a new nation as members of the National Plasterers’ Union.The challenge then is the challenge now.  How do we win fair pay for America’s workers?  How do we win, and protect, quality healthcare?  How do we retire with security and dignity?That’s what 2016 is all about.One of the reasons I was so excited to come here today is you get it.  You’re not the biggest union.  You don’t have the most members or money.  But when it comes to politics, you are a powerhouse.  You continually punch above your weight class.  So I can’t think of a better focus group for where we need to take our movement and our nation.This much is clear: we must come together to elect a president who will raise wages, so working people can build better lives.Two years ago, when I met with you at your convention, I talked about how America was hungry for solidarity.  Well, we’ve seen solidarity and the collective voice rise in this country, but we’ve seen the call for division grow, too.That is the choice we face in this presidential election.On the one hand, Republican candidates have used some of the ugliest, most racist and destructive language I have heard in my lifetime.  It is equal parts frightening and appalling.And their attacks on working people are just as bad.  Each wants to destroy the labor movement, silence our voice and give away even more to the rich and powerful. On the other hand, the Democratic candidates have engaged in a substantive and vigorous debate about how best to raise wages.While Republicans insult each other and the American people, the Democratic race has focused on reducing inequality and expanding opportunity and access to the American Dream.Brothers and sisters, we did that.  We put raising wages front and center.  Our activism has shaped the presidential process in ways that will benefit working people for years to come.  Now, that doesn’t mean we agree on everything.  It’s primary season and there are two pro-worker candidates running for the Democratic nomination.  As you know, the AFL-CIO has not endorsed.  Each member union is going through its own process, as part of a powerful tradition that I have enormous respect for.  I know you have backed Hillary Clinton.  That’s great.  Other affiliates are supporting Bernie Sanders.  This is how the process works.But we must and will be united when the primary process ends.  The stakes are too high.  As we head into the general election, I want every single one of you to get your members registered. Register your families, your neighbors, your friends and relatives.  You fight above your weight class.  Our entire movement fights above our weight class.  When the time comes, I want your members pounding the pavement, knocking doors, leafletting worksites, meeting with workers and families, and turning out the vote, because it is our time, and we won’t stop until we win!Brothers and sisters, CEOs have profited from four decades of our rising productivity, leaving us with flat wages and financial insecurity.  I’m sure you’ve seen the charts, but this is not an intellectual exercise.  We’ve felt it.  We’ve seen families struggle.  We’ve seen this national story play out in the lives of our family and friends, union and non-union alike, white collar and blue collar.During contract negotiations and election years, our members look to us to analyze the facts, to explain what the bad guys are doing, and to provide a path forward.But our members also look to us to see what’s possible, for a positive vision of where we can be, where we will be, when we stand together.You know, working people everywhere are realizing that the only organized voice for our interests is us.

The answer to economic insecurity isn’t right to work and lower wages.  It’s collective action and collective bargaining.In the labor movement, we know it’s the UNITED States of America.  United we stand.  Or divided we beg.This is a year for the American labor movement to stand up as the leaders we are.  This is the year we define America for the ages.What kind of a country will we be?  Will we retreat from each challenge, and sneak back into hatred and fear?

341,Trumka at Race Commission Hearing: Racism is a Cancer,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-race-commission-hearing-racism-cancer,2-1-2016,"Good morning, brothers and sisters.  Thank you for coming out today.A little more than a year ago, I was here in St. Louis for the Missouri AFL-CIO Convention.  It was shortly after Michael Brown was shot and killed by Officer Darren Wilson.When I was here, I talked about the fact that our brother killed our sister’s son.  Officer Wilson was a part of the local police union.  And Michael Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, is a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers.I know that line upset some people.  But we are a union family.  And families must be honest with each other.  We cannot afford to look the other way.Make no mistake, talking about race is tough.  It’s controversial.For many Americans, the entire subject makes them uncomfortable.But Dr. King said, the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but times of challenge and controversy.So in this moment of challenge and controversy, we must come together and ask the tough questions.  The time is right to have an honest conversation, listen to each other, and identify solutions.That’s why we formed this commission.From Oakland to Cleveland to Boston, we have held hearings like this, because combating racism is a labor issue.It has to be.  It is all around us.Corporations and politicians use race to divide us, to pit worker against worker, to hold us down, and to keep more money and power for themselves.So eradicating racism, and other forms of bigotry, is not only the moral thing to do, it is the smart thing to do.Addressing racism will help us win better wages, and benefits for all working people.  And it will make us a stronger political force, so we can tackle Friedrichs and right to work.Racism is a cancer, and it will destroy us if left untreated.  Too many of our brothers and sisters are being forced to live in fear.Since Michael Brown’s death, we have seen other young black men, like Tamir Rice, and Freddie Gray, die at the hands of police.Mass incarceration policies have devastated communities of color, weakened our movement, and made the job of law enforcement and corrections officers more dangerous.Bigots like Donald Trump have ushered in a new era of hate speech that is becoming disturbingly mainstream.  And discrimination continues to rear its ugly head, in our union halls and worksites.As a labor movement, we cannot be in the middle of the pack, when it comes to these issues.  We must lead from the front.  That means confronting racism, every single time we see it, or hear it.It is always easier to walk away—but we need to make clear, that racism is never acceptable.  It also means fixing the institutional prejudice that is hurting people of color here in St. Louis and across the country.Yes, #blacklivesmatter.  Our values and our principles remind us that every single person has dignity and humanity.So let’s come together today, and take on this difficult challenge, with open minds and open hearts.Let’s do it in a respectful way that encourages a real dialogue.  Let’s stand united as brothers and sisters, to make our movement, and our nation stronger.  Thank you.

342,Trumka to NDLON: The Future of Immigrant Workers is Not in Detention Centers,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-ndlon-future-immigrant-workers-not-detention-centers,1-30-2016,"Brothers and sisters, how can I thank you enough?  Your courage is inspiring.  Your dedication measures up to our nation’s highest ideals.  You are America, and we are all blessed by your presence.And I must extend a special thank you to my proud sisters who prepared such a fantastic breakfast.  Wow.  You prove that every single job is important.  Every single job, and every single one of us, has dignity, in the deepest and most profound sense.Our world literally works only because we make it work.  We make the breakfast and serve it, too.  We plant and harvest.  We build these buildings.  We make the roads, bridges and airports. Everything around us comes from the work of our hands.I must also thank my friend and brother, Pablo [Alvarado].  You’re a visionary, and I am always proud to stand beside you.  Thank you, too, for your activism.  I know you were arrested just the other day in an act of civil disobedience.  God bless you, Pablo.We are a proud partner of NDLON, which is doing incredible work in Los Angeles and across the nation.  You are helping give immigrant workers a voice, in hotels and restaurants, at car washes and construction sites.  Your organizing successes have helped immigrant families and communities build better lives.  And you are just getting started!We have so many devoted leaders here.  Thank you, Rusty [Hicks], for your kind words of introduction, and thank you, too, for helping raise wages in Los Angeles, and for going after employers who steal wages from workers.  In Los Angeles, wage theft language paired with a $15 an hour minimum is a great example of what works.  I’m glad to see Pasadena on that same path.And yet I didn’t come here today simply to congratulate you on your impressive victories.For months now, I have been calling out the ugly, racist and un-American language of Donald Trump.  I want him to hear me loud and clear, and I want all of America to listen, too.There is nothing more cowardly, more pathetic or more destructive than Trump or anyone else saying one group of people is somehow less than another.  It doesn’t matter whether the difference is based on race, religion, skin color, language, birthplace, sexual orientation or anything at all.  It violates what America stands for, and it should be condemned as an attack on our most sacred and closely held values.America stands for freedom and equality.  We value justice and decency.  We have the courage of our convictions.  We stand up for our principles.Today, I stand before you to say it’s not a crime to cross a border.  No one is a criminal for wanting a better life.The American labor movement stands with you, shoulder-to-shoulder.  I want every immigrant in America, and every union member, to hear this message: Keep organizing!  Keep standing strong!  Your collective action works.  It’s powerful.  There’s nothing stronger, and we will stand with you.  You will always, always, find sanctuary and solidarity in the American labor movement.  Always!The ugliness of Donald Trump’s campaign, however disturbing, is not exactly a surprise.  We expect this from our political enemies who stand against almost everything working families need.But America’s deportation crisis is a bipartisan failure. And I could not come here today without saying how disappointed I am with the Obama Administration’s recent decision to send women and children back to dangerous Central American nations.I have an enormous amount of respect and admiration for President Obama, yet the plague of immigration raids in America is nothing less than a travesty.  A human travesty.All over our country, those who fled violence and poverty to come here for a better life are being forced to live in fear.  This is wrong and today we say once again: stop the era of deportations!It’s time for us to ramp up the pressure on our elected leaders.  Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with America’s labor movement and our allies, we are going to protect all working people.We demand an end to deportations and safe haven for workers who speak up on the job.We call on the Supreme Court to give DAPA and DACA the green light.  But no matter what the justices decide, we will keep mobilizing and keep organizing.We shouldn’t be building walls.  We should be building bridges—to security and prosperity and a better life.The future of immigrant workers is not in detention centers.  It’s in worker centers like this one.So brothers and sisters, continue to stand up when your communities are under attack.  Your bravery is inspiring.  Your courage lifts us all.And whatever the future holds, we will never stop fighting, we will never stop dreaming and we will never leave your side.  Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

343,Trumka Outlines Labor's Agenda at House Democratic Issues Retreat,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-outlines-labors-agenda-house-democratic-issues-retreat,1-29-2016,"Good morning everyone.  It is great to be here.Leader Pelosi, thank you for that kind introduction.I’ve worked with many Congressional leaders over the years, and I can say without a doubt that labor has never had a better friend or stronger ally than Nancy Pelosi.Your door is always open.  Our staffs work well together.  And most importantly, the voices of working people are being heard in the halls of power.I also want to commend your entire leadership team.From Steny Hoyer to Jim Clyburn to Xavier Becerra, you reflect what’s best about our nation.You are fighting every day for a fair economy, a just society, and an America where even a minimum wage worker can aspire to a better life.And you keep up the fight, despite one of the most entrenched and reckless Republican majorities in our nation’s history.Just look at the pro-worker regulations House Republican leaders tried to repeal through the year-end appropriations process.  A rule to make union elections fairer; a rule to protect workers from deadly silica; a joint employer standard that reflects the true nature of today’s economy; and a rule to strengthen retirement security. Inside the Beltway, these repeal attempts are called riders.  But for working people, they are the difference between life or death, between paying the bills or falling further behind, between having rights on the job or being fired or harassed for speaking up.Working together, we didn’t just beat back one of these attacks.  We didn’t just beat back two of these attacks.  We stopped every single anti-worker rider.So on behalf of the entire AFL-CIO, I want to say thank you, thank you, thank you.We need you to continue to stand firm.  We’re counting on you.The attacks on working people are coming from all directions—whether it’s Wall Street, Congress, the Supreme Court, or even the Administration.Let’s take the tax on union health plans, for example.  We were proud to support the Affordable Care Act as a way to expand access and reduce costs.  But taxing the health care plans of working men and women was a bad idea from the start.  Our members worked hard at the bargaining table to negotiate quality affordable health care, often foregoing raises in the process. We shouldn’t be penalized for success.  This is a solidarity tax, plain and simple.  I appreciate those of you who stood with us to delay it for two years.  But let me be perfectly clear: we will not rest until this unfair tax is fully repealed.And then there is trade.  Now I know this caucus has some differences when it comes to the TPP. We don’t.  The American labor movement is united against this corporate trade deal, and millions of regular Americans stand with us.  That’s why it took a small miracle to pass fast track.  That’s why both presidential front runners have come out against it.The TPP is a bad deal.  It would drive down wages and standards at home and ship even more good-paying jobs overseas.  It’s labor standards are weak, it does nothing to address currency cheating, it creates a court system with special rights for big corporations, and it would take a sledgehammer to the U.S. auto industry—just as Detroit is getting back on its feet.As I said earlier, we will not always agree.  What we can do, and what we must do, is respect and listen to each other.  And I want to add that we at the AFL-CIO had an open mind when it came to the TPP.  We are not opposed to trade.  Like you, we recognize the importance of an integrated global economy.  That’s fair.  But from everything we have experienced, seen, heard, and read, we believe it is time to start over.So on behalf of all working men and women, I implore you to use your Constitutional authority to scrap this bad agreement so we can negotiate a better one.  One that works for America’s working people.  One that builds our communities and creates jobs and lifts up workers here and abroad.Being in the minority, I’m sure it feels like you are constantly on defense.  Trust me, those of us in the labor movement can relate.  Like you, we have to stand strong and respond forcefully to those who threaten our very existence.  But we must also be aspirational.And I am confident that you share our highest aspirations.I am confident that you are ready to rewrite the economic rules so that working families are in charge, not the wealthy and well-connected.I am confident you are ready to pass the WAGE Act so workers—not bosses—get to decide whether a workplace is unionized.I am confident that you are ready to fix an immigration system that tears families apart and betrays our values.I am confident that you are ready to welcome refugees and marginalize bigots.I am confident that you are ready to guarantee equal pay for women and equal protections for LGBT Americans.I am confident that you are ready to fight for paid sick leave and fair scheduling policies.And I am confident that you are ready to win criminal justice reform so communities of color can experience mass education and mass employment instead of mass incarceration.This is the America we must build together.  Where my plight is your plight.  Where hope trumps fear, and workers trump Trump.This is the America we must build, and this year is our chance to do it.But first, we must learn from the mistakes of the past.  There were many reasons Democrats struggled in the 2014 elections.  A bad map.  A fragile economy.  You name it. But in too many races, the Democratic candidate lacked a coherent economic message that made sense to regular working people—union and non-union.Now this is not about casting blame.It’s about working together and finding solutions so we can better communicate with our shared constituents.The AFL-CIO has been looking for new ways to reach out to America, too, as I like to say to union, non-union, and never-heard-of-union.  And to that end, the AFL-CIO invested in extensive messaging research.What we learned is that most Americans are moved by values, not just policy positions.On all of the key economic issues—good wages, health care, retirement security—the American people agree with us.But as long as life isn’t getting better for regular people, the Democratic Party and America’s labor unions leave the door open for the right-wing to beat us in the messaging war.We have good ideas—but we don’t always know how to articulate them, and too often, we don’t put them into action.And sometimes we are so used to talking to each other that we forget how everyday people receive messages.The right-wing is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to repeat a deceitful narrative about work and the economy.You’ve heard it—small government, lower taxes, personal responsibility.We need to come together and fight back with plain language of our own, and then we need to show the truth behind what we’re talking about.Let’s provide an aspirational call to a better life that goes beyond purely financial issues, and let’s do it without relying on Beltway-speak.  It’s about children and families and hopes and dreams.  We need to describe real experiences instead of political abstractions.In Washington, it’s called wage theft.  On Main Street, the boss stole my money.We need to make clear that our economic problems aren’t accidents.  Human beings caused them—on purpose.  And we can fix them.The economy is not like weather.  It is a set of rules, rules set by the men and women we elect.   And those rules determine who wins and who loses.Finally, we need to focus on the outcomes, not the process.Paid leave means more money in the bank and more time to spend with your family.  Wall Street reform means protecting your house and life savings from corporate greed.  Now this new message research isn’t a silver bullet.  But it will help us build long-term power for working people.Our research comes at a time when America is in the midst of a fundamental transition.There is a grassroots movement emerging.I see it as I travel the country.  Working people have progressed from identifying the problem to proactively addressing it.And we are doing it with two simple words: raising wages.Raising wages starts with the absolute truth that we should be decently paid for the work we do.No one should make less than the minimum wage, everyone should make a living wage, and collective bargaining should be available for all workers. Raising wages is about more than dollars and cents, though.  It’s a vision and an agenda that covers everything working people care about.Just look at what is happening.Five million union workers across America bargained contracts in 2015, winning pay increases in the first six months alone—the old-fashioned way—by standing in solidarity for them. Millions more will head to the table this year.Paid leave and fair scheduling are on the move in cities across the nation.  Twelve states raised their minimum wage on New Year’s Day and more will do so throughout the year.And we’ve seen organizing victories all over America.  Autoworkers in Tennessee.  Journalists in New York and Washington, D.C.  Adjunct professors in Pennsylvania.  Airline workers in Texas.You see, the single best way to raise wages, and keep raising them, is with collective bargaining. It’s with a union on the job.And everywhere we can, we’re turning collective action into collective bargaining.  The more union workers win, the more we’ll be able to raise standards for all working people.  That’s how we raise wages across the board.That’s how solidarity works.  That’s how America can build a strong middle class, one that will lead the world toward a new era of broadly shared prosperity.Once you’ve seen it, you’ll never forget it.  That’s the edge we have over the empty talk from the corporate right-wing.  Our answers are real, and we want you to join us on this path toward a better tomorrow!My friends, we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us.While bigots on the Republican side fight over who to deport or deny entry to America, you can put forward an economic agenda that brings this country together.And we can all talk about it in a clear, persuasive way that wins hearts and minds, and elections.As you win elections, together we can start to build the economy America needs.So let’s work together!  We’ll stand with you everywhere we can.  I would love to see Nancy Pelosi pick up that Speaker’s gavel again.  She’s a champion for working people!  Always has been!And I would love to see the word “minority” back in Mitch McConnell’s title.But we won’t stop there.  We’re fighting for pro-worker majorities in state legislatures to control 2020 redistricting.And of course, we are working hard to elect a Raising Wages president who will build on Barack Obama’s legacy.  The time is right.  The momentum is ours if we seize it!The American people are counting on us.  Let’s get to work.Thank you very much, and God bless you, and the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO.

344,Trumka: UAW Sets the Standard,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-uaw-sets-standard,1-24-2016,"Thank you, Brother Dennis [Williams], for your kind words of introduction.  It’s great to be with you, and for those of you who traveled here, welcome to our nation’s capital.Because of my roots with the United Mine Workers, I have always felt a special bond with the UAW.Our two unions helped create the greatest middle class the world has ever known.  The UAW’s collective bargaining with the automobile and other industries made history—and set the standard for years to come.You are living proof that the greatest engine of job growth is us, the working people who build our cars, teach our kids and keep us safe.  America does better when we can bargain for a fair share of the wealth we create.  Together, we are the job creators, because demand drives production, and production drives investment and jobs.Now I know you fell on hard times a few years back.  But in crisis, you showed courage.  Your members pitched in to save your companies, your industries and your union.  You were prepared to do so because true trade unionists know that sometimes you have to live to fight another day.That was then.  And this is now.With teamwork in the leadership and solidarity in the ranks, you did what was unthinkable five years ago: bargaining the best contracts in decades—maybe ever.  You protected your health care.  You helped secure investments in American manufacturing.  You stood strong for the veteran and the newcomer alike.Throughout the United States and the world, workers are standing up once again and saluting the UAW.And what a year you have had supporting workers seeking to organize.  Pundits and politicians were writing your obituary at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga.But I’ll tell you who wasn’t counting you out: the workers at that plant.  Congratulations to everyone, but especially the skilled trades workers at VW for joining our movement.  We’ve been working closely with your leadership to re-up our organizing efforts in the South.  What a boost and a shot in the arm you gave us.  You proved that we can organize in the South.  VW was just the beginning!Workers at Nissan and Mercedes and parts plants all over the South continue to show us the way. We know those workers will win with the UAW, too.The AFL-CIO is proud to be your teammate and your partner in this fight.And, by the way, I know you are a diverse union—across companies, across sectors, across geographies.  So congratulations also for the great work you are doing organizing workers outside of manufacturing.  If I’m not mistaken, you won recent victories among adjunct faculty. Welcome brothers and sisters!These victories in organizing and in bargaining are even more impressive when you consider just how out of whack our economy is.We live in the richest country on the face of the earth.  Corporate profits are at record levels. There are more billionaires than ever before.  Yet too many working people are struggling to make ends meet.It doesn’t have to be that way.  We had no control over whether it would snow here this weekend.  But the economy is not like weather.  It is a set of rules.  Those rules are decided by the men and women we elect.  And those rules determine who wins and who loses.For too long, big corporations have been the winners, because the rules have been rigged against regular people who count on a paycheck.  I don’t like it.  I know you don’t, either.  I don’t like America’s growing inequality.  I don’t like it that workers get illegally fired for talking about a union.  I don’t like how wages are so low that 62% of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings.  What are those folks going to do if the car needs to be fixed or their kids need a trip to the emergency room?The problem is the playing field.  Our economy has been tilted little by little, year after year, by politicians who want us to believe the American economy is either uncontrollable like the weather, or too complicated for us to understand.  That’s a bunch of crap.They’ve been rigging the system for more than 40 years, and we’ve had enough.Brothers and sisters, it is time to change the rules.We’ll do it with solidarity, real solidarity, you know what I mean, the kind where your picket line is my picket line, and my picket line is your picket line.  We’ll stand together, shoulder-to-shoulder, in the cold, in the heat, as long as it takes, because we aim to win!We’ll do it every way we can.  At the workplace.  At the bargaining table.  At the ballot box.  On Capitol Hill.  We are going to tell politicians over and over and over again about the priorities of regular working people.What I’m talking about is a broad agenda we call Raising Wages.Raising wages is what we’re all about.  But it’s not something given to us.  It’s something we win.  It rises from our activism and our collective voice.It starts with the absolute truth that we should be decently paid for the work we do, and that we define what decent means.  No one should make less than the minimum wage, everyone should make a living wage, and collective bargaining should be available for all workers. Raising wages is about more than dollars and cents, though.  It’s a vision and an agenda that covers everything working people care about.Let’s take trade policy, for starters.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a terrible deal because it would guarantee all kinds of special rights for Wall Street but leave working people in the dust. It would also take a sledgehammer to the American auto industry just as it is bouncing back.I want to thank each and every one of you for your hard work against the TPP.  Fourteen hundred  UAW activists lobbied Congress and told real stories about how this agreement would lower wages and standards.We’re powerful when we speak with one voice, loud and clear.  And let me tell you something: if the TPP comes up for a vote, we are going to kill it once and for all.And how about the so-called “Cadillac tax?”  It’s a direct attack on this very union, and it’s coming from members of both political parties.  I, for one, am offended by its name.  It assumes that somehow we shouldn’t get as much as someone else.  That’s complete B.S.We’ve worked hard at the bargaining table to negotiate quality affordable health care, often foregoing raises in the process.  We shouldn’t be penalized for success.  This is a solidarity tax, plain and simple.  Late last year, we were able to win a 2-year delay.  But we will not rest until this unfair tax is fully repealed so working people can keep the health care we have earned.We’re saying no to TPP and no to the solidarity tax!But here is what we are saying YES to -- the Raising Wages agenda.  A big piece of that agenda is something we call the WAGE Act.The WAGE Act would strengthen penalties against employers for illegal anti-union activity. It will help more working people stand together and send a message to bad bosses who are infringing on our right to a better life.The WAGE Act isn’t the be-all, end-all, and it won’t happen overnight, but we’re going to push it forward, and when it’s law, you’re going to like how it feels.  And so will millions of other workers, those in unions and those trying to form unions.Let’s stand together for raising wages, brothers and sisters, for a better America, and a better tomorrow.  Let’s march together, organize together, mobilize together, vote together and win together!This is our country, and it’s time we took it back.Brothers and sisters, when it comes to the American economy, you’re going to hear all kinds of stuff that doesn’t make a lick of sense.  Like I said, there’s no mystery to it.Some people say raising wages hurts jobs.  That’s not true, 72% of our economy is driven by consumer spending.  When a regular person has enough to buy a refrigerator or a new car, guess what?  They buy it, and that leads to growth.The UAW knows the best road is the high road.  Your union has been lifting up working families for generations.  And we need your leadership now more than ever.UAW members have made great sacrifices for the good of our nation.  The auto industry is back on its feet.  It is time for the workers on the line to get a fair share, and for all UAW members, from the university to the casino, to get their fair share as well.Over the next few days, as you attend your workshops and lobby on Capitol Hill, I want you to keep in mind the future we’re going to win.Back in the 1930s, a lot of people would have scoffed at the idea that America would be on the eve of entering her most prosperous era, but that’s exactly what happened.Politics back then was full of the same kind of hatred and toxic language that we’re hearing today from the likes of Donald Trump.  He’s nothing new.  He’s just another hate-monger in a business suit.Well, working people stood up to gasbags like him then, and we’ll do it again.  I have every confidence that the UAW will stay at the front of the pack, just like you always are.The UAW consistently, time after time, does the right thing.  You used multi-tiered contracts to save jobs and the American auto industry, and I know that you are absolutely dedicated to making all of your automakers equal once again.  That’s not easy, but it’s right.  It’s leadership.Walter Reuther said and I quote: “There's a direct relationship between the ballot box and the bread box, and what the union fights for and wins at the bargaining table can be taken away in the legislative halls.”If Walter were alive today, he’d be leading the charge to change the rules.He understood that our only fidelity is to our membership.  That’s who we represent.  That’s who we fight for.  That’s who we win for.  Not Republicans.  Not Democrats.  Working men and women.We have one yardstick: what’s good for our members.  And we know the best thing for our members is raising wages.When America’s working people do better, we all do better.  It’s as simple as that.Raising wages is good for our economy, our communities and our country.And if some is good, more is better.Yes, we’ll campaign.  Yes, we’ll fight.  Yes, we’ll lobby for what working people need.These are the tools to change the rules, from the workplace to Washington D.C.  And we’re going to use these tools to build a new era of raising wages!It’s up to us to build a better tomorrow.  We’ll do what it takes.  We’ll keep fighting for it together, shoulder-to-shoulder, because we know that if we want it, we've got to work for it.Keep working for it.  Keep fighting.  Today.  Tomorrow.  As long as it takes.Thank you.  God bless you and God bless America!

345,Trumka in Las Vegas: Immigration Should Be a Pipeline to Prosperity,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-las-vegas-immigration-should-be-pipeline-prosperity,1-12-2016,"Good morning brothers and sisters.  It’s great to be with all of you.  Thank you Brother Danny [Thompson] for that kind introduction.Almost one year ago, the AFL-CIO hosted a national summit to launch an agenda for shared prosperity. We call it Raising Wages.Raising wages is our path forward.  It’s how we, together, change the rules, so every person who counts on a paycheck can do better this year, next year, and the year after that.Raising wages is what we’re all about.  But it’s not something given to us.  It’s something we win.  It rises from our activism and our collective voice.It starts with the absolute truth that we should be decently paid for the work we do, and that we define what decent means.  No one should make less than the minimum wage, everyone should make a living wage, and collective bargaining should be available for all workers. Raising wages is about more than dollars and cents, though.  It’s a vision and an agenda that covers everything working people care about.  Let’s take trade policy, for starters.  We’re fighting hard against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because it’s another corporate giveaway that would cut wages and kill jobs.  That’s why it’s a bad deal for working people, and together we’re going to stop it once and for all.And how about the tax on our health care?  You know, the one that would take money out of our pockets?  We’ve worked hard at the bargaining table to negotiate quality affordable health care. We shouldn’t be penalized for success.  This is a solidarity tax, plain and simple.  Late last year, we were able to win a 2-year delay.  But we will not rest until this unfair tax is fully repealed so working people can keep the health care we have earned.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court heard arguments yesterday in a case that could fundamentally undermine the rights of working people.  It’s called Friedrichs versus California Teachers Association and it’s the latest attack on our ability to stand together.  The Koch Brothers and their allies are spending billions of dollars to destroy us.  But we will not let the corporate right-wing silence our voice.  We will stand up, we will speak up, and we will fight back!We’re hungry for raising wages, and we’re starting to make progress.  We’re winning fair scheduling reforms at the local level, and paid sick leave and other bread-and-butter policies that lift up working families.  I’m telling you, raising wages isn’t pie-in-the-sky.  It’s happening.  Just look at the numbers: 5 million union workers across America bargained contracts in 2015, winning pay increases in the first six months alone the old-fashioned way—by standing in solidarity for them.  Millions more will head to the table this year—and we are committed to ensuring all workers have collective bargaining rights, including those in the emerging on-demand economy.Workers have also been winning minimum wage increases at the ballot box and in city halls. And two million retail workers stood together and won raises from Walmart and Target and Marshalls and TJ Maxx.Some of that collective action has turned into union growth.  Look at IKEA.  Workers there stood together and won two raises in 2015.  They experienced the power of the collective voice firsthand.  So now they have decided to form a union.We’ve seen organizing victories all over America.  Autoworkers in Tennessee.  Journalists in New York and Washington, DC. Adjunct professors in Pennsylvania.  Airline workers in Texas. With contracts we solidify our gains, and build on them.  We’re turning collective action into collective bargaining, and we’ll keep doing it, by using the momentum of 2015 to organize even more workers into unions.  This is our moment.Just down the street from us, 500 hard-working men and women at Trump International Hotel recently voted to join the Culinary Workers Union and the Bartenders Union.  How do you like that?The victory at Trump will raise the standard of living of every one of those working people, and it will also apply upward pressure on wages throughout the local and regional economy.  That’s why a collective bargaining agreement is the single most powerful tool to create a raising wages economy in America.Let’s hear it for raising wages!  We’ve started.  We’ll keep it up.  If some is good, more is better. We want more.  We want better.  We want raising wages!It feels good to celebrate the union victory at Trump, and I urge management to start bargaining a fair contract immediately.  Yet today I’m asking you to consider another very important piece of the Trump victory and the Raising Wages agenda, and that’s the rights of immigrant workers.Today, two out of every five hospitality workers in Nevada lack legal work status, which means speaking up on the job requires a double act of courage.  An immigrant worker risks everything, from economic security to separation from family, every single time he or she goes to work, and especially when they join an organizing drive.Even when they win a contract, too many of our brothers and sisters can’t fully enjoy its benefits, because they lack basic rights and protections and face the very real threat of deportation.
Eleven million men, women and children who work and dream in America live every day with legalized discrimination and criminalization.  It’s a betrayal of our values, of the shared belief that all of us are vital to the well-being of this country, which has for hundreds of years been built and sustained and renewed by immigrants and refugees who come here in search of a better life. Today I am redoubling the commitment of the AFL-CIO and the American labor movement to end the era of mass deportations and to achieve comprehensive immigration reform.Just over a year ago, President Obama took executive action to protect millions of immigrants from the looming threat of deportation.  We stood with brave immigrant workers to push for this long-overdue relief and remain ready to put it into action.  But from the moment the president signed the order, obstructionist politicians and partisan judges have used every possible tactic to stall progress.Republican presidential candidates have made matters worse, shouting dangerous and irresponsible charges that stereotype and scapegoat people from entire countries and faith traditions.  These politicians propose racial profiling, wholesale deportations and even ethnic and religious litmus tests.  Make no mistake, this is racism and bigotry in its most fundamental form. 
We expect this from our political enemies.  But America’s deportation crisis is a bipartisan failure.  The Obama Administration’s recent decision to send women and children back to dangerous Central American nations, often without proper due process, is shameful.  All over our country, those who fled violence and poverty to come here for a better life are being forced to live in fear.  This is wrong and today we say once again: enough is enough.  In the shadow of this ugliness, the real crimes that hurt too many working people are going unaddressed.  Wage theft.  Discrimination.  Deadly disregard for health and safety.  Sexual harassment and assault.Immigrant workers are by far the most likely to face this gross exploitation on the job, and we must all stand together to change that.  When one worksite is dangerous, the standards for working people everywhere get worse.  When one group of workers is targeted, wages are lowered across the board.  Our immigration system should be a pipeline to prosperity, not to prison.  It must be a tool for justice, not systematic oppression.We will take the lead in stamping out all forms of worker exploitation.  Part of that work involves reviving a proven practice to help build worker power.  It’s an initiative called “We Rise.”  For a century or more, America’s union halls have provided the setting for countless working people to become naturalized U.S. citizens.Today, our unions are stepping up again.  We are training literally thousands of shop stewards and community volunteers to help people gain rights and status, and to join in the fight for more and better protections.  We are helping immigrant workers and families naturalize, as well as navigate President Obama’s deferred action programs.  We aren’t waiting for the courts.  We are holding dozens of community workshops to help ensure that eligible workers are ready to apply on Day One.Our unions have a moral imperative to help end the routine abuse immigrant workers face.  We stand on the shoulders of people who spoke with thick accents, who were called names and discriminated against.  We are a movement of immigrant workers, and we will fall or rise together.This time next year, a new president will be preparing to take office.We need a president who will stop the criminalization of immigrant workers and communities by reigning in federal enforcement agencies and standing strong against radical state and local governments.We need a president who will prevent immigration raids that target workers for legal union activity.We need a president who will honor our proud tradition of providing refuge to families who seek protection in a dangerous world.And we need a president who will lead by example, stop mass deportations, and get just immigration reforms across the finish line.Our collective action and activism will dictate who the next president is, and more importantly what he or she does once elected.  The coming year, 2016, is our chance to set the agenda.For years I have said, and I mean it, that we do not work for any candidate or political party.  Our agenda comes first.  It drives our politics, not the other way around.Any candidate who wants the support of the AFL-CIO must explain how they will make our economy better for working families.  We refuse to accept a “less-bad” candidate.  We don’t want the lesser-of-two-evils.  That’s what we said at our Raising Wages Summit one year ago, and it’s what we’re saying here in Nevada today.Raising wages is our standard.  It’s how we write new rules and transform our economy so all working people can build better lives.  It means more money in our pockets, more time with our families, and more dignity and respect on the job.  Raising wages will help all working men and women—immigrant and non-immigrant alike—grab their well-earned share of the American Dream.Brothers and sisters, let’s stand together for raising wages, for a better America and a better tomorrow.  Let’s march together.  Let’s organize together.  Let’s mobilize together.  Let’s naturalize together.  Let’s vote together.  And let’s win together.

346,Trumka to Humphrey School of Public Affairs Students: America Does Better When We All Do Better,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-humphrey-school-public-affairs-students-america-does-better-when-we-all-do-better,11-18-2015,"Brothers and sisters of Minnesota’s powerful labor movement, students, faculty, visitors and particularly my sisters and brothers of AFSCME Local 3800 who made possible this event and so many others at this great institution, thank you for such a warm welcome.  It’s wonderful to be with you.Also, I want to thank you, Kyle [Makarios] for your kind words of introduction, and for your role in the academic community here.  In fact, you help make Minnesota a model for how education, working people and also businesses and economic thinkers can work together for the common good.And of course I must recognize Morrie Kleiner, who holds the prestigious AFL-CIO chair in labor policy here at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs.  Morrie, it’s great to be with you, my brother.  Thank you for all you do.  All working people are honored by the work you do here at the Humphrey School.It’s an understatement to say we at the AFL-CIO are proud of our connection to the Humphrey School.  We watch and study your work with keen interest—whether it’s advancing early childhood education, partnering with the Minneapolis Federal Reserve to promote collective bargaining, or lifting up working people in the Twin Cities and around the region.  You’ve got a good thing going on.We need there to be a lot going on.  And by “we” I mean all working people in America, union, non-union, never-heard-of-union.  By “we” I mean everyone whose life would change dramatically for the worse if we lost our paychecks.Some people don’t need to work a day in their life.  We don’t need to worry about them.  They’re doing great.  But the situation isn’t so hot for the rest of us, and that has got to change.  It will change.  We’re going to change it.Here at the Humphrey School, you concern yourself with solutions.  I’m eager to hear from you about what works and what we need to change.I should mention, also, the hard work and creative political advocacy of AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler.  Maybe some of you have met her, especially the young workers here.A few weeks ago, Liz gave a powerful speech on issues affecting working women, and the whole of American society.  And this week she’s working jointly with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on finding ways to advance those important policies.And that gets me to an important subject, because policies are important, but so are the political routes to enacting them.  We cannot simply talk about our ideas.  We also must address the political hurdles we face, because they are many and tough as hell.You see, some people don’t embrace our value of a full and democratic society based on broadly shared prosperity.  I’m talking about the 1% who have used every political and economic tool to drive down wages and divide working people.  They aren’t finished.  They’re still coming after each and every one of us who counts on a paycheck to live.And so I’m going to talk about our tools, about unity, activism and the collective voice, and how we will use those, to surpass the hurdles we face today as well, and those we will face in the future.Hubert Humphrey talked about the test we must set for ourselves: not to march alone but to march in such a way that others will wish to join us.That’s a founding principle of unity.  And we see it working today in the rise of the collective voice in America.  We see it in the rising collective voice right here at the University of Minnesota, where workers are sitting across from managers to win fair pay, fair benefits and a secure retirement.In fact, brothers and sisters, this year 5 million union workers all across America are bargaining contracts.  This is the biggest year for collective bargaining in our nation’s history.  All of us helped our employers pull through in the hard times.  The worst of the recession is behind us, and we want a fair share.In the first six months of this year alone, working people in all kinds of jobs have won a pay increase, on average, of 4.3%.  We won it the old-fashioned way—by standing in solidarity for it.That’s not all.  2015 has also been the biggest year for raising non-union wages in recent history, through both grassroots activism and electoral politics.  We have seen higher minimum wages all across the country.  Right here in the Twin Cities, you’ve got a powerful and growing campaign for a $15 minimum wage.  That’s fantastic.  Half a dozen cities are on track toward a $15 minimum wage, joining another half-dozen major cities that already have it.  And for the first time in history, federal legislation was proposed at the same level.This spring, 2 million retail workers stood together and won raises from Walmart and Target and Marshalls and TJ Maxx.  When Ikea raised wages earlier this year, the results were so good they raised wages again.  And just last week, workers at an IKEA in Massachusetts went on strike for union recognition—so they could bargain for even better wages. Our work raising wages has opened millions of eyes.  People now see hope.  We see solutions. We see a path toward a better future.Raising wages is how we lift up our families and our communities.And raising wages will kick-start the greatest engine of economic growth the world has ever seen, a well-paid American workforce!But we face a complex political landscape.  To shed a light on that dynamic, I want to tell you a story.  This comes from the United Packinghouse Workers of America, the men and women who turned cattle and pigs into beef and pork.Like most of America, just a few short generations ago, packinghouse workers were divided by race, the term was a “Jim Crow” local.  Does anybody here know what a Jim Crow local is?Well, for those who don’t know, I’ll explain.  It meant there were two local unions, side-by-side, in the same plant, a black local and a white local, separate and unequal.  In one instance, the white local earned a nickel more an hour, a nickel, and when business slowed, the black workers got laid off first.On first blush, it seems the white local had it good.  After all, they got a nickel more an hour and layoff preference, but the truth is they struggled, too, to earn enough to raise families and to have a good life.  Those were hard jobs that didn’t pay much.At the bargaining table, every time the white union got tough, the managers would tell them to go ahead and strike.  You see, those managers had confidence in the divisive power of that nickel.  Those managers were confident that enough black workers would cross the picket line to keep the plant open.  And that threat never failed to bring the white local to heel.And then, after the white local settled for a pittance, the black local got the same deal, only a little worse.Think about how powerful that nickel was, how it kept the white families in poverty and the black families broke.And yet instead of standing in unity, the whites jealously guarded that nickel, because it wasn’t much, but it was something.  They were scared to lose it.  They justified it.  And you can bet those black workers resented it terribly, every single day.But then, this is a true story, the black workers convinced a few whites that the nickel wasn’t a bonus, but a foot on the necks of all of the workers.  As long as the nickel divided them, the workers couldn’t stand together.And so finally, the white local voted down the nickel, and dissolved the two-tier system into one, and both groups bargained together, and won twice that nickel for everybody fair and square.Those Packinghouse Workers knew the meaning of unity.  They understood it, and lived it.  They looked at the big picture, and saw what was really dividing them.  They faced it, and they dissolved it.  And if you think it was easy for the white local to give up that nickel and join the black workers on faith alone, think again.  That took courage.  That took trust.America needs that same unity today, the same courage and trust, because we are divided left, right and center.  The latest attempt to divide us has made its way to the Supreme Court.  It’s a case called Friedrichs versus the California Teachers Association that threatens to weaken the rights of teachers and nurses and other public employees.  The corporate right-wing wants to pit public workers against private workers but we will not let them.Just like those workers in the Jim Crow locals, the differences between us are illusions, but illusions that create real pain and real suffering.  And it is these illusions that the right-wing is quick to take advantage of.Cynical and hateful politicians like Donald Trump play on our fears that we could lose what little we have.  That’s why they target immigrants, and women, and people of color, and public workers, and union workers, and you name it.They are sophisticated when it comes to using fear and division.  They’re sophisticated and ruthless, but they can be beat.  We can beat them with unity.Yes, it takes courage and trust and faith in solidarity.The truth is, America does better when we all do better, but we must stand together.We’ll stand with teachers, taxi drivers, meatpackers, and everyone else who works for a living.We’ll stand with #blacklivesmatter and police officers on the beat.  We’re all brothers and sisters.We’ll stand with unemployed veterans and immigrants who want a better life.We’ll stand, really stand, shoulder-to-shoulder, on picket lines, your picket line and my picket line.  We’ll stand together when it’s bright and sunny, and when it’s hard, when it’s raining and dark and cold.There’s one way to win, and it’s together.  Together for as long as it takes to win what we need in America, good pay, good benefits and a better life!Across America, working people are building political power.  As president of the AFL-CIO, it is my honor to stand with those workers, but don’t for a minute think we are or would claim to be the master of this movement.  It’s big.  It’s powerful.  It’s an honest-to-God groundswell with the same integrity as the movement that created industrial unionism in America nearly a century ago and that won so many civil rights victories a few generations later.And yet, our corporate opponents have political power, too.  It’s declining, true, but it’s still powerful, like a dinosaur that has lived past its time.  It’s big.  It’s vicious.  But it’s ready to be pushed into extinction.And so we go forward with our campaigns to raise wages and for other good policies, even as we fight against bad policies like destructive Wall Street trade bills full of corporate entitlements.President Obama and the Wall Street and Washington elite are trying to push through the Trans-Pacific Partnership.It’s a big test.  It’s a big test because the TPP is a symbol of everything I’ve been talking about. Who will write the economic rules in America?  Working people are sick and tired of these trade deals that rip apart the fabric of our nation.  We’ve seen the shuttered factories and dying towns.  We’ve talked to the workers who lost everything, only to be told they should retrain in another field for half the pay.Less than two weeks ago, after six long years, the Obama Administration finally released the text of the TPP.  It would hurt all of us who depend on a paycheck to survive.  It would drive down wages, kill jobs, give corporations special rights, hurt consumers, and jeopardize the public health.And none of us should forget: The damage doesn’t stop there.  By destroying jobs, the TPP would further ruin America’s tax base, and that would bring more trouble to great public institutions like the one we’re standing in right now.We intend to end the era of disastrous trade deals, and we intend to end it now.  And I want you to join our coalition.  Everybody.  Students and seniors and workers.  We are going to fight like hell against the TPP, and kill this bad trade deal once and for all. We are reaching out to build a winning coalition, a coalition strong enough to beat back bad policy like the TPP and respond to Friedrichs and other attacks on our freedom to lift up our jobs and communities.We know our opponents will try to find ways to divide us, metaphorical nickels, if you will, but we also know how to call out division for what it is, and then have to courage to stand together.Economic inequality in America is bad, even as our economy produces more wealth than any nation ever in history.We intend to build a coalition strong enough to put together the policy components of the right deal, one that can raise wages, one that can bring us a new day and a bright future for everyone who works for a living.Thank you, and God bless you.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

347,"Trumka in New Hampshire: ""Raising wages is what we're all about.""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-new-hampshire-raising-wages-what-were-all-about,11-7-2015,"Thank you Sam [Novotny] for that great introduction. With young leaders like you, the labor movement is in good hands.Good morning brothers and sisters.  It is great to be back in New Hampshire.  There is something extra special about coming here during the political season.  There is a buzz in the air.  Fall, football and the New Hampshire primary.  It doesn’t get any better than that.Voters in New Hampshire don’t rely on debates or television interviews to get to know the presidential candidates.  You interact with them one on one—in town halls and diners and often in your own living room.  New Hampshire plays a unique role in choosing our next president. What an awesome responsibility.So I thought I’d talk today about the state of the labor movement, the role we are playing in this election and why that role is so important.In January, the AFL-CIO hosted a national summit to launch an agenda for shared prosperity called Raising Wages.Raising wages is what we’re all about.  It’s good for working families and the nation.  And it comes from activism and the collective voice.This agenda is about much more than wages, though.  It’s about—the opportunity to work for a better life.  It’s a philosophy, a vision, and a plan all rolled into one.  It starts with the absolute truth that we should be decently paid for the work we do.  No one should make less than the minimum wage, everyone should make a living wage, and collective bargaining should be available for all workers.  But it goes far broader and deeper than that. Raising wages means trade policies that lift incomes in America and around the world.  It means modern labor laws that give everyone who works a real opportunity to bargain for higher wages without fear.  It means allowing workers to demand and win paid time off and fair schedules so we can sustain healthy families.Now those of you who have worked in Washington know that summits and conferences happen all the time.  More often than not, after the last speech is given and the lights are turned off, people go back to business as usual.  Not this time.  Our national summit was a beginning, not an end.  We created an agenda—a standard by which all things would be measured.  We also scheduled four regional summits in the early campaign states.  We previously had one in Iowa and will bring our message to Nevada and South Carolina in the coming months.We knew this time had to be different for two important reasons.First, labor is under attack like never before.  The corporate right-wing and their allies are waging the most sophisticated anti-worker campaign we have ever seen. They are holding down our pay. On purpose.  They are coming after us in all 50 states.  In city halls and state legislatures.  In Congress and even at the Supreme Court.So we need allies.  Allies like Governor Maggie Hassan.  The 2014 election was a tough one for working families.  But we were proud to come together and re-elect Governor Hassan.  Under her leadership, New Hampshire had more economic growth last year than any other state in New England.  Governor Hassan understands that we must invest in infrastructure, education, and most of all, working men and women.  She pushed through the Paycheck Fairness Act to guarantee women equal pay for equal work.  She successfully worked to freeze college tuition for New Hampshire students.  She has been a champion of a living wage.  And she has stood strong against efforts to pass right to work in New Hampshire.Governor Hassan also knows that our trade policies should export American products, not American jobs.That brings me to the second reason we couldn’t settle for the status quo after our national summit: fast track.The truth is unfair trade deals have ripped apart the fabric of our nation.  You know it and I know it.  We’ve seen the shuttered factories.  We’ve visited the towns that look like they are stuck in the 1970s.  We’ve talked to the workers who lost everything, only to be told they should retrain in another field.  That’s why we fought so hard against fast track.  We were fighting for the future of the American Dream.The work you did and the solidarity you showed was an inspiration.  Your letters, your phone calls, your e-mails, and most of all your energy, helped moved the dial.  It was a sight to see.In the end we came up just a few votes short, but we changed the trade debate forever.  The Wall Street and Washington elite thought the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a slam dunk, but we have slowed down the entire process.On Thursday, after six long years, the Obama Administration finally released the text of the TPP. To our disappointment but not our surprise, it is a bad deal for workers. It would drive down wages, kill jobs, give corporations special rights, hurt consumers and jeopardize the public health.The release of the TPP text confirmed our worst suspicions—this deal would be a disaster for America. So brothers and sisters, we are going to continue to make our voices heard.  We are going to fight like hell against the TPP. And when it comes up for a vote, we are going to kill this bad trade deal once and for all. Just as the Raising Wages agenda is about more than wages, the fast track fight was about more than trade.Fast track was a symbol of an economy out of balance—a set of rules written by and for big corporations.So the debate raised a fundamental question: do we want to be a nation that values work, community, investment and productivity?Or will we continue to reward wealth, profit, monopoly and inequality?Brothers and sisters, we may have lost the vote.  But we won the debate.  We changed the conversation in America. We can raise wages!We see it in new worker organizing in manufacturing, construction, retail, and fast food.We see it in five million union workers are speaking up together, the biggest year for collective bargaining in American history.We see it in a recent Gallup poll that shows support for unions at a seven-year high.And we see it in the 2016 presidential campaign.I don’t know about you but I thought the first Democratic debate was one of the best I have ever seen. Here are just a few of the highlights.Hillary Clinton came out against the TPP and emphasized the words “raising wages.”Bernie Sanders decried the “casino capitalist process.”Martin O’Malley talked about passing a living wage and investing in infrastructure in Maryland.Make no mistake, labor is influencing the debate. We are setting the terms and conditions of this election.We have said all along that the presidential candidates must explain what they will do to make our economy fairer for working families. That’s what we insisted on at our national summit in January, and that’s what you are demanding here in New Hampshire today.We have also been crystal clear that we do not work for any political party or candidate.  We work for working people, plain and simple, because we want the freedom to live better lives, to take care of our families and to improve our jobs and our communities.Brothers and sisters, for too long we’ve worked for the Democratic Party.  In this election, we’re making the Democratic Party work for us.Heck, even last week’s Republican debate included a discussion about inequality.It is clear we are part of a powerful movement at an historic time and you are on the front lines.  It starts with us and it starts here in New Hampshire.We’re building collective power in the workplace, in the economy and in politics.From now until the New Hampshire primary and beyond, we need to keep up the pressure.We need to keep shaping the debate and making our voices heard.We have a message for all the presidential candidates and anyone else who will listen.We are going to do everything in our power to raise wages.We are going to join together for good pay, great benefits and safe workplaces.We are going to fight to guarantee women are paid one hundred cents on the dollar.We are going to push for policies that make it easier to form a union and bargain collectively, and harder for employers to deny us those rights.We are going to stand united and defeat the TPP so we can start investing in working men and women again.And we are going to spend every single day building an America of shared prosperity that gives every one of us the opportunity for a better life.Thank you! God bless you, and the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
348,"Our Days, Our Lives: Working Women Need a Voice on the Job",https://aflcio.org/speeches/our-days-our-lives-working-women-need-voice-job,10-27-2015,"AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler delivered the following keynote address on women and work:Shirley Chisholm broke ground as the first African-American woman elected to Congress. But back in 1970, she knew her story was the exception, not the rule. Speaking during a debate on the Equal Rights Amendment, she said and I quote: “Discrimination against women, solely on the basis of their sex, is so widespread that it seems…normal, natural and right.”Normal, natural and right. With three simple words, Chisholm captured just how pervasive gender discrimination had become. But what about now? What exactly is the state of working women 45 years later? Or as someone might say in the midst of a long journey: are we there yet? The answer is complicated. While the ERA ultimately fell short, women in the workplace have gained a great deal—laws to protect our rights, new freedoms, and career opportunities that were once thought unimaginable.Today women serve as doctors, lawyers, soldiers, and astronauts. They run big corporations like Yahoo and Pepsi. They are police chiefs and baseball umpires and electricians—jobs once reserved exclusively for men. And there’s a pretty good chance a woman will be leading the free world in January 2017. No one can deny that progress has been made.But there is another side of the coin. While the discrimination that Chisholm referred to as pervasive and widespread is less overt today, it still exists. It is experienced by every woman who takes home a smaller paycheck than her male counterpart for doing the same job. It is felt by every mother who is denied a promotion because she wants to balance work and family. It hangs like a dark cloud over every victim of workplace harassment, discrimination and violence.Even as we celebrate the advancement of women in work, the harsh reality is too many of us struggle when we shouldn’t have to. Sheryl Sandberg asked us to “lean in.” But most working women are already leaning in so hard we are practically falling over. We are being forced to hang on, scrape by and make do.But, as usual, working women are rising to the occasion. We understand that our growing role in the workforce carries new responsibilities—financial responsibilities, for example, as heads of households, and decision-making responsibilities in our homes, communities and jobs. We embrace these responsibilities as part of making progress.What we don’t accept—what we have to stop accepting—is the price society demands from us in return: little to no say over the days of our lives.The feminist author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie put it this way, powerful words brought to light in Beyoncé’s hit song Flawless:We teach girls to shrink themselves.
To make themselves smaller.
We say to girls.
You can have ambition.
But not too much.
You should aim to be successful.
But not too successful.
Otherwise you will threaten the man.For too long, women have been told to reach high, but not too high. To dream big, but not too big. And at the same time, working women have been asked to shrink ourselves. To assume it is our job to tidy up after a meeting. To duck our heads when men stare at us. To smile when we don’t feel like it. To be happy we have a job at all. And when we dream, to do it quietly and be content that it probably won’t work out.Not anymore. We need to make our voices heard.The status quo is not working. A typical woman who works full time loses more than half a million dollars over her lifetime because we are paid less than men. Women are the majority in low-wage jobs. Women have a greater share of responsibility at home but, if we don’t have the benefit of a union, are unlikely to have earned sick leave or paid family leave.This is especially the case for women of color. I’m a proud feminist and I suspect many of you are as well, which has guided our progress on issues from health care to reproductive rights. But we feminists cannot ignore who has been left out and left behind—namely women of color. Women of color experience lower median weekly earnings, higher rates of poverty and greater unemployment. While women overall make 79 cents on the dollar, black women and Hispanic women only make 63 cents and 54 cents, respectively. Yet the women’s movement—and yes, the labor movement—have been slow to address these issues. We cannot outsource this work to others. As feminists, we must stand up for all working women.We need to stand up for workers like Tina Sandoval. I had the privilege of meeting her last week in Oakland. When I got the chance to speak with Tina, she had just finished an overnight shift at McDonald’s and only gotten an hour of sleep. With tears in her eyes, she talked about being paid barely enough to afford her 500 square foot apartment, let alone care for her children.“We’re all struggling,” she said to me.Managing life on a low income can be a full-time job in itself. Take three buses to work because you can’t afford to live closer. Take another bus to the grocery store because your corner market doesn’t have fruit or vegetables. Have two extra trips to the doctor because you don’t eat enough fruits and vegetables. Hunt for where you can buy a pair of used skates for your son’s birthday because you can’t afford new ones.Struggling is a verb. It is hard work.Unfortunately, corporate policies are making our schedules less predictable, less flexible, and less fair. Just look at the practice known as “clopening”— where workers are forced to come in for back to back closing and opening shifts—with only 7 or 8 hours between. Working women are being left with less control over how much time we can spend with our families, and when. Less say about simple things, like getting ourselves or our kids to the doctor, being active in our congregations, meeting with a teacher, getting more education or training, reading a book, or watching our favorite show. Advancing at work shouldn’t mean surrendering the rest of life.Unfair scheduling is not an equal opportunity problem. It primarily affects low-wage workers, two-thirds of whom are women. But many higher income women get trapped in the 24/7 workday too. Their version of “clopening” is falling asleep and waking up with their smartphone clutched in their hand. As one employee at Amazon told the New York Times: “The joke in the office was that when it came to work/life balance, work came first, life came second, and trying to find the balance came last.”Don’t get me wrong. We understand that the vast majority of CEOs are not sitting around thinking about ways to hurt their workers. What they are doing—what the corporate culture demands of them—is to cut costs and increase the bottom line. But the burden of this system, which is driven by money, is being endured exclusively by workers. CEOs aren’t being asked to “clopen.” Companies aren’t cutting executive pay to save money. Technology is being used to bolster shareholder profits instead of shared prosperity.And society is quietly accepting this as nothing more than business as usual. We as women know about quiet acceptance. Too often, we go along to get along. And this enables all sorts of seemingly benign decisions to chip away at our rights, our freedoms, and our opportunities. When quiet acceptance becomes business as usual, we risk relegating ourselves to second class status where it really counts: our daily lives.We have to make quiet acceptance the enemy. We have the power to change this pattern. We need to join together and speak out for good wages, great benefits, fair scheduling and equal pay for equal work. We need to demand paid sick leave, paid family leave, and quality child care. These things are accessible and available to us if we stand together for them.With one contract, union membership can achieve most of the goals I just identified. As the single largest working women’s organization in America, we can also drive up wages and standards in predominately female and low-wage industries.But I understand that unions are not available for everyone. The small business owner, the middle manager, and the independent contractor need a way forward too, as do the workers at companies that make it virtually impossible to unionize. So whether a worker can form a union or not, it is through collective action—by standing together instead of going it alone—that women can regain control of our lives.We saw the power of collective action at Walmart. Seven months into her pregnancy, Tiffany Beroid was told by her doctor she needed to take on lighter duties at work. But Tiffany’s managers would not budge. They forced her to take a leave of absence. Eventually she had to drop out of school because she couldn’t afford both supporting her family and paying for tuition.Tiffany knew what happened to her was wrong. She connected with other Walmart workers from across the country on Facebook and found out she was not alone. They formed a worker-led group called “Respect the Bump,” holding events, sending letters, and even introducing a shareholder resolution. And groups like the United Food and Commercial Workers Union and the National Women’s Law Center took up their fight. Shortly after these actions, Walmart changed its pregnancy policy to allow for accommodations. If women can change Walmart, we can change the world.Our movement has always been about being able to control our own destinies. About having the same rights, opportunities, and responsibilities as men. About being equal under the law and in our everyday lives. Now is the time to step back and truly assess what we are missing and what more we can be doing.First, as a labor movement, our approach always begins with worker voice. What’s good for working women is good for all trade unions. Millions of us will come together this year and bargain for a better life. But we must do more. So today we’re launching a comprehensive survey about the lives of working women. We developed it with broad cross-section of union women… retail workers, school administrators and teachers… home care workers and professional employees… clerical workers, actors and machinists.This survey will take the pulse of working women inside and outside the labor movement. It will be a baseline measure of working women’s lives… our stories. Stories that we will share over and over again until all working women are heard—women of color, immigrant women, women in jobs across America.Second, we need to take these stories and unite behind a policy agenda that gives working women more rights on the job and more freedom in their daily lives. Last week, Congressman Paul Ryan made work/life balance a condition of his speakership. That took some nerve, especially for someone who has voted against every single proposal to give workers more time and flexibility.We support paid leave for Paul Ryan. But you shouldn’t have to be Speaker of the House to spend time with your family. Tina Sandoval, Tiffany Beroid and workers all across America should have these same rights. That’s why it’s so important that we pass the Schedules that Work Act, the Healthy Families Act, and the WAGE Act, legislation which would help level the playing field and give working women the opportunity to live healthy, happy and productive lives.Finally, there is good old fashioned negotiating. Union women do it all the time—contracts, arbitrations, mediations, disputes, you name it. This is about knowing what we want, determining fair ground rules, and then hashing it out on a level playing field. We want to pass on our experiences and our skills. So we are going to train, cajole, encourage, support, and inspire women to win better wages, standards, and working conditions the best way we know how—through solidarity.As working women, we have to stretch what we know and expand our idea of progress. We refuse to rest on our laurels. We refuse to leave anyone behind. For every advance we have made, we must ask: what’s next and what’s after that? Simply keeping up isn’t good enough. We have to go the extra mile for all women to truly benefit.Forty-five years ago, Shirley Chisholm described gender discrimination as normal, natural, and right. We have come a long way since then, but our work is still unfinished.Working women are a formidable force. Together, we can make equal pay, paid leave, and fair scheduling the law of the land. Together, we can pledge to never shrink ourselves and always stand up for our rights. Together, we can reject quiet acceptance and build an America where all working women can sustain their families and realize their dreams. Today we are closer than ever. Tomorrow, if we do our job, it will be normal, natural and right.Thank you.  © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",AFL
349,"Trumka to Machinists:""We're in this together.""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-machinistswere-together,10-9-2015,"Thank you for having me.  It’s wonderful to be here.  And thank you, Brother Hasan [Solomon], for your truly generous words of introduction.Sisters and brothers, I want to thank you for being a part of this conference.  Your union is powerful.  Your history is inspiring.  Your future is yours for the making.  As volunteers and activists, you are the roots from which the strength of our movement rises.That’s an important truth for all of us to remember.Sometimes we can feel isolated in the work we do.  Maybe you serve on a young worker committee, or you are dedicated to women’s issues or LGBTQ equality, or maybe issues of justice have motivated you to become more involved.  You’re not alone.  You’re part of a movement, and your passion, your ideas, your convictions and your actions make us stronger.You are the raw material of our shared power.  Yes, we are all individuals, but our movement is a united and powerful force strong enough to change America, and to change the world.So thank you.We’re in this together.  We need each other.  And when we stand together, we win together.When I say “we” are in this together, you might wonder who exactly I’m talking about.Let me be absolutely clear.  I am at this conference to carry a simple message: Issues of young workers, human rights, and women’s equality are important to our entire movement.  This is no sideline interest or side project.  These are mainstream issues, central to every single person who works for a living.When it comes down to it, almost every challenge we face is a work issue.  The ugly practice of chattel slavery was a work issue.  Jim Crow was a work issue.  The high student debt and gross unemployment and underemployment rate among millennials is a work issue.  The gender gap is a work issue.  Mass incarceration and #blacklivesmatter are work issues, because part of the problem is a lack of good jobs.  The fact that LGBTQ workers can still be fired in half of all states is a work issue.  And fight for immigration reform is in many ways a fight to give immigrant workers dignity on the job.These aren’t your issues and my issues, these are our issues.Let this conference be more than just another get-together.  Let’s use it to renew our dedication. Let’s use it to spark that light in our hearts, to spur us to unite in public and in purpose.  This is our time to join hands, to raise our voices and to build a movement that can lift all of us, together.I want to tell you a story that captures this challenge in several different ways.  It’s about a mom I know, a young black woman named Natasha Maye who works as a nurse’s aide in Philadelphia.  When her paycheck was short the first time, she thought it was a mistake.  But it happened again and again.  She looked over her hours and realized it was systematic, intentional. So she tried to fix the problem without becoming a problem.  She was nervous.  I’m sure you can understand.  She needed the job.I admire Natasha’s courage.  I don’t know what’s harder than standing up for yourself when it seems like you’re all alone, but that’s exactly what she did.  In doing so, she found out she was not alone.  At her employer’s headquarters, she saw her coworkers, arguing about hours cut from paychecks.  She even saw supervisors call the police on those who were speaking out.  She was scared they’d call the cops on her, too, but she needed justice.  And she needed the money she had earned.She was embarrassed to even be in this predicament.  That’s what she told me.  She said all she wanted to do was break down and cry.  But she needed to feed her children and pay her rent.  And then Natasha’s employer fired her, without ever settling up the money they owed her.The good news is Natasha and her coworkers filed a class action suit against the company.  She got involved in her local labor movement, and now she’s a powerful activist against wage theft and for justice in a hundred different ways.I told you that story because Natasha hadn’t even heard of the term “wage theft” before it happened to her, and it happens to workers all over the place every single day.  It’s an epidemic. But it’s about a lot more than wage theft.I told you Natasha’s story because employers target anyone they think is vulnerable.  They’ll target women, millennials, immigrants or just someone who seems desperate for the work, who seems more likely to suffer than fight back.Natasha’s story is important, too, because when she fought back, her energy and enthusiasm helped fuel a grassroots movement for justice in Philadelphia.  A recent study there, the first of its kind, gave us a detailed look at the effects of wage theft, and it’s bad.  And today, the fight against wage theft in Philadelphia is powerful and growing.And finally I told you this story because it’s about justice and basic dignity for men and women, for families, for women of color, for young workers and for an entire community.We’re not fighting against some hard-to-grasp idea of injustice.  We stand against the specific actions of those in power who choose to cheat working people, who try to hold us down to enrich themselves.  From erratic schedules to unequal pay, from high unemployment in communities of color to workplace discrimination against those of us who are transgender, these are the result of policies and decisions, and activism can help erase them.We are here at this conference because we know work matters.  Whatever you do, no matter how humble, you do your part to make America run.And together, we’ll rise to create an economy guided by this idea, an economy that works for working people and helps all of us live better lives.Pretty much everywhere I go these days, I talk about the need to raise wages.  It’s an overarching idea that encompasses all of our priorities, but it’s about much more than dollars and cents.  It’s about basic human dignity.  It’s about our ability to live good lives, to raise families if we want to and to take part in our communities.We know the single best way to raise wages is with a union.  And our unions need to be about more than dollars and cents too.  Raising wages also means paying closer attention to everyone who is discriminated against, anyone who’s targeted, who’s hurting, who needs someone to stand with them.It’s critical, because the idea that some people are “others,” that some people are different than us, is a lie.  It keeps us divided.  It keeps us down.  The truth is simple: When you get hurt, it hurts me.  When I get hurt, it hurts you.Whoever you are, wherever you are, a Native woman in Edmonton, or a transgender man in Washington, DC, you are not some “other.”  You are my brother, my sister.  Our fates are intertwined.  When you rise, I rise.  We rise together.  Those are our values.If we want our world to reflect our values, we’ll have to work for it.We’ll work for it.  We’ll stand for it, for justice.  We’ll get up together.  We’ll yell together. We’ll mobilize and march together.  Today.  Tomorrow.  Every single day.  The Machinists will get it done.  I love this union.  I really do.  God bless you, and keep up the fight!  Thank you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
350,"Trumka to Global Labor University: Raising Wages ""Our Guiding Star""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-global-labor-university-raising-wages-our-guiding-star,9-30-2015,"Thank you, Brother Mark [Anner], Frank Hoffer and FES.As an alumni of Penn State University, I am proud of the work you have done to bring the Global Labor University program to the United States.  I know it hasn’t been easy, but it’s obvious that you are filling an important role in America.It’s wonderful to be part of this historic conference.  Thank you for bringing us together.And I especially want to thank our brothers and sisters who have joined us from so far away -- from Brazil, South Africa, India, Germany and so many other countries.  Thank you.As I look around this room, I see familiar faces.  I’m glad to see new faces, too.Together, old friends and new, as activists and academics, we will, in the words of Pope Francis, build a “globalization of hope.”Corporate agendas have been driving the world economy for too long.  The world is ready for new ideas, ideas to put the lives and fortunes of typical working people, regular families, at the center of global economic policy.It will be our job to put forward these ideas, to scrutinize and test them, and then showcase the ones that work.Brothers and sisters, here in the United States we have had an absolute whirlwind of a month. America hosted our Holy Father, who inspired an often-polarized nation to focus on a global agenda based on justice, not greed.  He spoke against “corporations, loan agencies, certain ‘free trade’ treaties, and the imposition of measures of ‘austerity’ which always tighten the belt of workers and the poor.”  He said the world needs a new economic model.  We listened to what Pope Francis said.The rules of the global economy and trade have been front-and-center this year.  Working people in the United States seized the narrative.  Instead of the old conversation of trade versus no-trade, we demanded a conversation about what kind of trade works, what trade should accomplish and who it should benefit, and a powerful coalition grew around the idea of holding corporations accountable, of denying them special rights and special deals at the expense of the rest of us.This coalition has stalled the outdated model of corporate globalization.  In Washington, we dashed the Wall Street dream of another quick and easy corporate trade deal—the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  The deal still won fast track approval, but only barely, and progress has all but stalled since, because as it stands, the deal would hurt regular working people, and pad the profits of multinationals.Corporate profits must not come before working people, and that means a loud no for features like the investor-state-dispute-settlement.  It also means an enthusiastic yes to trade provisions that protect our health, not the gross profits of pharmaceutical companies.The TPP remains on the table.  At the AFL-CIO, we have negotiated hard for three years to transform its harmful language into something better, a deal to benefit workers around the world. I’m not optimistic it will get better.If it doesn’t improve, we will pull out all the stops in a campaign against it, but only if our hand is forced.  If TPP dies, it will only be because it wasn’t done right.  We will use the same criteria to build a pro-worker trade agenda with our partners in Europe as our governments negotiate the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.This conference is important, because the time is ripe for new ideas and action.  Working people need solutions.  We need to be proactive on climate.  We need a just transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.  We must adapt to new technologies and find ways for workers to stand together in what’s become known as the “gig” or on-demand economy.Our goal must be to strengthen labor movements around the globe, so working people every-where can help fuel a world economy built on real demand -- demand from wages not debt.How we choose to engage with a changing global economy that is creating massive inequality is up to us.  How we change the way we approach organizing and corporate campaigns relies on the analysis we will lay out over the next few days.  What comes next is up to us, not simply on trade but for all aspects of the global economy and workers’ rights.  We have a great opportunity.No one should doubt the power of our coalition.  Make no mistake: The pendulum of power is swinging back in favor of workers.  We have tasted fresh wins, with organizing retail workers at Zara, with the Bangladesh Accord, with the Uber campaign, with the delay of the TPP.That’s the power of a united front.  People are looking at our labor movements a lot differently than they did before.  A few corporate interests thought they could run the world.  They won’t stop trying, but the ball is in our court.  What will we do?At the AFL-CIO, we are guided by one basic principle.  It’s our guiding star: We want to raise wages.Economic inequality hurts working people everywhere, and raising wages can fix that.  Inequality stifles opportunity not only here, but in places like Cambodia, Honduras and Swaziland.  It promotes the terrible scourge of human trafficking from Thailand to Malaysia and Qatar.  It drives the poorest among us to seek jobs, even in terrifyingly dangerous situations like in Bangladesh and too many other countries.We want to raise all wages, the wages of men and women, because gender-based discrimination remains part of the lives of women in too many workplaces.  We want to raise wages to help end discrimination based on skin color, sexual orientation, and gender identity.  I want to be clear: No one should be harassed, fired, deported or worse because of who they are or who they love.We are committed to justice and basic human rights, including the right of people to stand together on the job.  We will honor the dignity of refugees and migrants, wherever they come from.  In the United States, we demand comprehensive immigration reform to give equal rights to 11 million undocumented workers.  This call for justice goes far beyond the United States.  We support the global call to strengthen commitments to resettle refugees and those who seek asylum from violence.  All migrants and all refugees must have access to decent work.Our call for justice extends to the environment.  We aim to address global climate change and to provide clean air and safe water to world populations, and we will do so under the principle of a just transition.  Here’s what that means: Workers and communities in and near the fossil fuel industries cannot be made to shoulder the cost of our transition to clean energy, and new clean energy jobs must give workers a voice and must be good, family-supporting jobs.  In the developing world, affordable energy must improve the standard of living of poor people.We want all transitions to be just, not excuses to knock down working people.  Too often, that’s what technology has done.  Businesses, customers and workers can connect with each other in new ways.  We can embrace the best aspects of these changes while still making sure jobs of the future are good jobs.  I’ll offer some specific points on the technology issue in a moment.The outlines I’m giving you are broad, I know.  But each subject has substance.Let me give you an example about corporate accountability.  It involves Bangladesh, but I could just as easily talk about progress in Honduras, the Dominican Republic or a number of other countries.You know about the Bangladesh Safety Accord, how 1,200 workers died at the Rana Plaza garment factory when it collapsed in 2013.  We all know how more than 200 major global brands and retailers—including Zara and H&M whose clothes had been made at Rana Plaza—signed an agreement to make garment factories safer.  The accord requires independent inspections by safety professionals.  It says the client global brands and retailers must help contractors cover the cost of safety upgrades in factories, and then must commit not to cut and run from that upgraded factory.What we’re looking at now is a real-world example of the difficulty of holding governments and corporations accountable.  Inspections have taken place.  Dangerous conditions have been documented.  Improvements have been spelled out, but almost nothing has been done, and that’s where things stand.  In the coming weeks and months, specific cases will begin to go to arbitration.  Even now, as I speak to you, labor unions and our allies, largely in the United States and Europe, are raising money to cover the cost of the arbitrations.  We intend to use the Bangladesh Safety Accord to hold these global brands accountable, and then we want to take what we’ve learned and apply it everywhere we can.As I said, that’s just one example.  We’re developing dozen of tools to lift up working people, and then we want to use these tools everywhere in the world.In Europe and the United States, we have other challenges.  When it comes to companies like Uber, let me be clear: the innovative use of algorithms and apps to connect customers to services is absolutely genius, and it serves the public well, but classifying Uber drivers as independent contractors is ridiculous.  The same is true when it comes to home healthcare workers.Now, when it’s not true, when workers truly are independent, we must use smart regulation so our society can realize the improvements offered by the digital frontier while preserving worker security and co-determination.Today’s labor laws in the United States and in Europe are based on a model of continuous full-time employment—like a factory worker—that’s just not the way most people live anymore. Today, a lot of working people want control of their own time.  Our legal frameworks need to change, too, so people aren’t faced with the hard trade-off of a good living on the one hand and the flexibility to care for small children or ailing parents on the other.  Also, labor law must cover fast-growing sectors of the economy, especially those areas which are excluded today. Right now in the United States, I’m talking about day laborers, domestic workers and piece workers.Too many working people look at a future of endless insecurity, trapped by well-capitalized labor brokers who choose to see themselves as employers.  Our hands may create profits for multinational corporations, and yet we remain isolated, unable to bargain for enough to live, let alone for what’s fair.Let me give you an example of the hard outer edge of today’s digital economy.  This story comes from the Nation Magazine.  It involves a woman named Stephanie Costello, who wanted to earn more money online but found herself trapped doing piecework, and earning far below minimum wage.  It seemed promising at first when she signed up with a company called Mechanical Turk. She started doing tiny jobs, like typing a word from a web page or answering a quick question about a web site.  Many of these jobs last only a few minutes and pay as little as 7 cents, but some pay a few dollars.The work piled up but the pay didn’t.  And that’s the point.  Workers like Stephanie find themselves falling deeper and deeper into debt.  The competition among such workers is intense and anonymous, and it’s making companies like Amazon rich.In years past, people united to fight the poverty of piecework.  Those unions became the world’s middle classes.  It’s time for us to unite again, to find new ways to raise our collective voice. We’ll regulate digital work, not fight it.  We want people to do digital work, and to be able to work for a better life.From Dhaka to D.C., we want work to help us live better lives.  We want the freedom to work our way out of poverty.  That’s what work must do.  It cannot trap us or hold us down.We want to raise wages.  That’s our focus, and the single best way for working people to lift wages is with a voice on the job.  Unions are our main focus, but not our only one.Our world isn’t poor, but too many of the people who create the world’s wealth are.Here in America we have already begun to chart a new course.  We’re demanding our politicians address economic inequality and its fundamental cause—employers holding down wages—in meaningful ways.But we’re not waiting.  This year, 5 million working men and women—more than any other single year in American history—are sitting down across from managers and bosses to negotiate fair pay.  It’s a big deal, and the early evidence shows we win when we stand together.  On average, in the ratified contracts, working people raised wages by 4.3%.  Those numbers are a big deal to us, because we don’t do sector-wide bargaining.  Every union negotiates its own contract.Every worker in the world should be able to sit down across from his or her employer to negotiate fair pay.  And every worker must have the freedom to safely advocate for unionism. It’s time to end the common global practice of weak company unions, whose only purpose is to increase corporate profits.  Today, it is dangerous to start a union in too many countries, in every place where the government can jail you for political speech.I am proud that the brothers Vincent Ncongwane and Patrick Mamba are with us from the Trade Union Congress of Swaziland.  I am proud that our government selected TUCOSWA, as one of three civil society organizations to speak at a White House event this week at the United Nations. Thank you, my brothers.  You know what it means to risk life to organize unions.  Your courage inspires us all.Let’s use that inspiration.  Let’s put plans into motion.  The world is hungry for it, so work can work for regular people.  The Global Labor University will play an important role as specific aspects of these rules continue to take shape.I’m proud to stand with you.  I’m proud to lead beside you.  Our opponents stand against us, but when we unite, the numbers are on our side.  No matter how long they stand, we’ll stand longer. We won’t be out-organized, out-worked or out-lasted.Our hands make the value, and with our hands and our hard work we’ll make life better, for ourselves and each other, and for our children and children’s children.Thank you and God bless you, and the work you do.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

351,Trumka to Bricklayers Convention: Together We Rise,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-bricklayers-convention-together-we-rise,9-14-2015,"Thank you, Brother Jim [Boland], for your kind words of introduction. And thank you all for having me here at your convention. This is an important year… 150 years of continuously lifting up the lives of working people.I am extremely proud of this union.  You make good buildings. You bargain good contracts.  You organize. You stand up for what’s right. You live the theme of this convention… “Build… Adapt… Change.”150 years ago… bricklayers and stone masons and craft workers of all kinds stepped away from their jobs and joined the fight to end the evil of slavery. After a terribly long and bloody war, the forces of freedom prevailed. Some of those soldiers returned home and founded this union. That is a powerful legacy, and it guides the Bricklayers to this day.As a union, you remain committed to fairness and freedom for all… for our new immigrants and for our brothers and sisters of color. I see your commitment in your resolution against mass incarceration and your statements for justice and #blacklivesmatter. I see it in your work for immigration reform and for your direct advocacy for union and non-union bricklayers alike.Every day, and in every way, the Bricklayers are fighting to expand American freedom.Across our entire labor movement, we’re finding new ways to build bridges within our communities, and one issue is particularly urgent today… and that’s the epidemic of racism. When we are divided by race, it is easier for our political opponents to keep us down, to kill our jobs and lower our wages.We know racism is wrong. We believe with every fiber of our being that #blacklivesmatter. Our core values tell us every life matters. Every single life. That’s why we must eradicate bigotry in all of its forms.  To do this, we need a true dialogue… so all of us can be heard. This isn’t about casting blame against other working people. This is about all of us… together… moving forward toward justice… and shared prosperity… guided by our shared values.Brothers and sisters, we’re here in Baltimore for this convention because we know work matters and so do the people that do the work. Whether you’re laying bricks to build a school or cleaning its classroom floor, you do your part to make America run.Together, we’ll rise to create an economy that really works for every single one of us!To understand the challenges ahead of us, we don’t have to look any further than his great American city.And I want to personally thank you, Mayor Rawlings-Blake, for your leadership in our united effort to bring jobs and justice to Baltimore. We have a lot of work to do here, but we will persevere. We can and will make progress. And we will stand beside you as together we rebuild Baltimore from the ground up. You’ve got my word on that.Brothers and sisters, please join me in a show of appreciation for Mayor Rawlings-Blake!  Brothers and sisters, we are activists. We are trade unionists. We know what’s right and what’s wrong, and we’re not afraid to stand up and say it.We are guided by one central idea. It’s like our North Star. We’re working… for a better life. The way we’ll get there is by raising wages… any way we can and everywhere we can. We want raising wages and everything that comes with it.  Good pay, great benefits, fair schedules, paid sick leave and a voice on the job. We know the best way to raise wages is to organize.  The best ladder to the middle class is a collective bargaining agreement. It is the single best way to raise wages and build a ladder to the middle class. Collective bargaining is our priority, but we’ll raise wages any way we can. We’ll campaign to raise the minimum wage. We’ll fight for paid sick leave and family leave. We’ll win fair schedules and equal pay for equal work.We know what works… and we know what doesn’t work. Corporate trade deals don’t work. That’s why we’re against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The truth is these trade deals have ripped apart the fabric of our nation.  You know it and I know it.  We know the shuttered factories and the towns that look like they’re stuck in the 1970s.  We know workers who lost everything, only to be told they should retrain in another field for half the pay.Democrats, Republicans, Independents, whatever, ALL working people are tired of these damn bad trade deals full of corporate entitlements. And let’s be real, our trade policies are a bipartisan failure.  For three decades, Democrats and Republicans have sold us down the river.  From NAFTA to CAFTA to Korea and now the TPP, our elected officials have continually put profits over people.  That’s why we fought so hard against Fast Track.I want to thank you for everything you did to kill Fast Track. Let me tell you, we came this close to achieving our goal. The corporate lobbyists pulled out every trick in the book and still only managed to squeak by. But listen close. We have forever changed the debate about trade in America.Our opponents thought the TPP was a slam dunk.  It was supposed to be finished by now.  But there is still no agreement.Brothers and sisters, we did that.  We made everybody, including the elites, take a long hard look.  And if it comes up for a vote, we are going to kill the TPP once and for all. Not only that… the unity we forged during the Fast Track fight will help us in other important fights… from fair overtime pay to labor law reform.  We are demanding more. We are demanding better. We are demanding raising wages and a rising tide for every worker in America!Raising wages is our measuring stick for the 2016 election. As you know, the AFL-CIO has not yet made an endorsement, but we are not sitting back.  We have been grilling presidential candidates on what actions they will take to make our economy fairer for working families.We also make crystal clear that we do not work for any political party or candidate.  We work for working people, plain and simple, because we want the freedom to live better lives, to take care of our families and to improve our jobs and our communities.Brothers and sisters, for too long we’ve worked for the Democratic Party.  It is time to start making the Democratic Party start working for us.A big part of our raising wages agenda is collective bargaining.  And let me tell you, collective bargaining is on the rise.  This year 5 million union workers are negotiating contracts.  This is the biggest year for bargaining in American history.  So why is this important?In the first six months of this year alone, working people in all kinds of jobs have won an average pay increase of 4.3 percent the old-fashioned way—by demanding it.  By standing in solidarity for it.With our contracts, we can raise the bar for ALL workers. So your contract lifts up my contract, and my contract lifts up your contract. And I want you to know the AFL-CIO will have your back as you head to the bargaining table.  And my message to employers everywhere is this: we helped you pull through the hard times.  Profits are rising.  We expect our wages and benefits to rise with them.  We want our fair share.Raising wages also means investing in our infrastructure. We need to go big.  I’m talking trillions with a T. No more nickel-and-dime transportation bills.  America should have the best infrastructure in the world—and I want you to help build it.  Investing in infrastructure… whether its school construction or energy… is the smart thing we can do.  It will make our jobs better.  It will create new jobs.  And it will have economic benefits across the supply chain—what people in transportation like to call the multiplier effect.  So it is long past time for our elected officials to get off their butts and take care of business. And when they do, they’ll take care of our end, building the infrastructure, together.Let me close with a story.  I remember back when my son Rich was young—maybe three or four years old.  Now he’s a lawyer. He’s getting married in just a few weeks. Back then when he was a kid, his grandfather had gotten him one of those battery operated jeeps.  You parents know what I’m talking about.  He and his buddy Chad were driving around in the backyard.I was out there too—talking on the phone about what else—unions.  Rich must have overheard me because he drove up and said: “Dad what’s a union?”So I told him to try to push his jeep up the hill in our backyard.  He strained and struggled, but he couldn’t get it up the hill.  Then I told his friend Chad to give him a hand.  Working together, they got the job done.  I looked right at my son and said: “That’s a union.”Today working men and women can feel like we’re struggling and pushing without getting anywhere.  Wages are too low.  Benefits are too few.  Retirement security just isn’t.It’s hard. And the corporate right-wing is waging the most sophisticated anti-worker campaign we have ever seen.But even in the face of these enormous challenges, I know we can… and we will win a new day for working people… together.The Koch Brothers and Scott Walker can spend all the money in the world, but they do not have the men and women in this room.I will take our might over their money any day of the week.When we work together, there is no challenge too difficult, no obstacle too great, no hill too steep.So brothers and sisters, pledge with me today that we’ll fight together.  We’ll stand together. We’ll push together. We’ll organize together. We’ll mobilize together.  We’ll register together. We’ll vote together. And we’ll win together.Thank you!  God bless you, and the work you do.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
352,"Trumka at Executive Council on Diplomacy: ""The public wants justice, not more of the same.""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-executive-council-diplomacy-public-wants-justice-not-more-same,9-10-2015,"Thank you, Philip [Vaughn], for your generous words of introduction. I’m honored to be here.Two years ago, when I last spoke to this group, the world economic picture made some people hopeful. Just a few months ago, even, some people said we were leaving the crisis behind. Unemployment had come down, young people were finding their first jobs, the stock market rose… housing prices grew.Yet I would say we are still living in a time of crisis.  We have seen turmoil in recent weeks in capital markets all over the world.  At the heart of this turmoil is a set of global economic rules that keep wages down and workers powerless.  So, in China we see an economy built on low-wage exports that cannot make the transition toward wage-driven growth. In the United States our economy, so different from China’s in so many ways, like China’s cannot grow because flat wages hold it back. In Europe, austerity and attacks on workers’ bargaining power in southern Europe have pushed the continent as a whole back toward recession.Everything that follows—capital market bubbles, currency devaluations, massive trade deficits—are all about trying to paper over the failure of this low-wage model. This failure cannot be papered over. There is no way around it: Global economic rules that keep wages down and workers powerless has led to secular stagnation and economic and political instability.As president of the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD—the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development—I represent the labor movement in global economic policy discussions. In forum after forum, I hear the same solution—austerity—being offered over and over again. Even though, our wages have been flat, and inequality is thriving, somehow regular people are to blame! Somehow the answer is to lower wages even more, undercut the rights of more working people and make inequality worse.Look at Greece. The country has lurched from debt-crisis to debt-crisis, but instead of balancing spending cuts with debt-forgiveness, it’s been all-cuts, all the time. These cuts make life harder for regular people, while investors don’t feel any pinch. And that’s not all. Negotiators have gutted Greek labor law as part of the solution, too. In short, all these fixes have only made inequality worse, and workers are left with less leverage to bargain for raises when productivity rises.We can dress up those bad moves with terms like “structural reforms” or “labor market flexibility,” but the end result doesn’t change. Life gets harder for people who count on a paycheck to live, and the investor class gets richer. And the basic measures of economic health—GDP growth, unemployment, wage levels—keep falling.And yet a fresh and powerful vision for our global economy has been gaining ground. You can see it clearly in the teachings of Pope Francis. Later this month, His Holiness will bring his message to the United States—the message that each of us matters, that every one of us has value—and the public is ready to listen.Ready to listen, and ready to act. Here in America we have already begun to chart a new course for ourselves. We’re demanding our politicians address economic inequality and its fundamental cause—income stagnation—in meaningful ways.Our world today demands action. A top priority for the AFL-CIO and our global labor partners is to make a new set of rules for the global economy so work works for regular people. We see trade as key to setting those rules. Just look at how hard it was for President Obama to win Fast Track Trade Authority for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We objected to Fast Track, because it doesn’t allow our elected officials to amend problematic parts of the proposed trade deal—and there were and are a lot of problematic parts of what the United States seems to be proposing in trade agreements like the Trans Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.For example, ISDS—the Investor-State Dispute Settlement provision—would give corporations the ability to hold for ransom laws passed by democratic governments. We’re concerned about a trade model that gives more rights to foreign corporations than to a country’s own people. We are concerned about any trade dealt that puts corporate profits over the health of families. That’s why we also continue to raise concerns about access to affordable medication for the world’s poor.In the end, sure, Fast Track squeaked by, but our efforts have strengthened a strong new coalition extending from the labor movement to community and small business groups to Doctors Without Borders and Oxfam. And this summer, the TPP has all but stalled. Mark my words, we have forever changed the trade debate in America. It will never be the same. We built very real, very powerful momentum for a new America, and we’re not stopping.Listen, this isn’t about being pro-trade or anti-trade. This is about what kind of trade works for workers in the United States, in Mexico, Vietnam and around the world. Can trade lead to jobs that are safer and pay more? Can trade increase productivity? Can wages rise along with those productivity gains?  Will the people who do the work in the world’s economy share in the wealth we create?  The Fast Track debate also highlights the link between trade and migration. Around the world, millions of desperately poor workers are fleeing across borders in search of jobs and opportunity. Right now, we see migrants dying literally by the boatload in the Mediterranean Sea and by the truckload in Europe. It’s heartbreaking, and it’s only one example of the tragic effects of a worldwide race to the bottom. Listen to this: 27 million men, women and children—regular people just like you and me—have been trafficked and are today trapped in slavery.During the Fast Track debate, proponents tried to turn a blind eye to the problem of forced labor and human trafficking in Malaysia and other countries. Well, that cat is out of the bag. We all know how Administration officials whitewashed the problems in Malaysia, once again allowing corporate profits to trample real people.The public wants justice, not more of the same.One of the most compelling voices for justice for people who risk danger in the search for a better life has been Pope Francis. Back in 2013, when the Holy Father made his very first trip outside Rome as the leader of the Catholic Church he met not with world leaders but with humble migrants. It was on a tiny rocky Italian island in the Mediterranean Sea, just 70 miles from Africa. He celebrated Mass and laid a wreath in the sea for the thousands of people who drown while trying to reach Europe.Pope Francis has spoken beautifully about work. He said, “We do not get dignity from power or money or culture. We get dignity from work.”These are powerful messages, and they require me—and us—to look at migration and human suffering and work as central parts the global economy.When corporate entitlements are the goal of trade deals, working people suffer and die. The United States has a free trade agreement with Guatemala, which is one of the most dangerous places in the world for someone to try to form a union. The Bush White House made promises. International negotiators put forward the strongest labor commitments ever. And yet corporate thugs continue to murder working people, and no one even gets arrested.I can’t mention Guatemala without acknowledging the way popular protests there led last week to the resignation of the president and his cabinet. We don’t yet know what will happen there, but it is clear that people want justice.How can we embrace trade deals like the one with Guatemala? Who benefits? A handful of wealthy investors make more money, that’s all. It’s not worth it.Work shouldn’t hurt or kill, but it does. Work hurts when factories collapse or catch fire. The workers at Rana Plaza in 2013 were earning only $35 a month making clothes for our markets when 1,200 of them died. Many more were injured and disabled.All over the world, regular men and women lack basic justice and economic opportunity, in particular with the growth of on-demand employment. It’s time for a change. In the United States, we have seen men and women protest and win raises at Walmart and Target and Ikea. A movement has been growing to raise the federal minimum wage, and the Fight for $15 has brought fast food workers into the streets.All this comes back to one of the basic points I want to leave you with today: America and frankly our entire world is at an inflection point.What does it mean to be at an inflection point? It means we’re ready to go in a dramatically new direction. Trade is about the best place for us to start, as we rewrite the basic global economic rules.I’d like to tell you what that new direction could look like.Quite frankly, the trade talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership offer a place where we see the possibility of a high-road trade model.This model could be consistent with the AFL-CIO’s larger economic goals, which we define as this thing called the Raising Wages Agenda. It’s our yard stick and our guide. All of our policy goals fall under it, and it’s about much more than just money. It’s about the ability for regular people to work for a better life. And that means holding corporations accountable for their supply chains. We don’t want multinational companies to continue creating an environment where disasters like the one at Rana Plaza happen.You see, when you start looking at trade from the premise that the goal should be to make lives better for average people, a whole bunch of stuff that has become standard in corporate dominated trade agreements suddenly fall away, and other things get added.ISDS falls away, and we see new provisions to hold cross-border investors accountable. We see ways to improve regulations for environmental protection, toy safety and migrant protection. We see ways to find and lift up best practices, to protect food safety and encourage investment in education and healthcare.The rights of workers have to be at the center of trade agreements. For instance, it’s too dangerous to start a union when a government can jail you for political speech. That happens in too many places around the world—and in too many countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We need freedom of speech and freedom of association to allow working people to safely organize unions and raise wages.The TPP and the TTIP are incredibly important. They would create rules for 60% of the world economy.  We need to understand they are more than trade deals—they are documents creating the rules for the global economy.I’m somewhat optimistic with what I’ve seen on the trade deal with between the United States and the EU. It could build stronger standards. It could enhance workplace democracy and fair bargaining by giving workers more information about the financial condition and assets of employers. It could also require stronger rules on workplace safety and give temporary and contract workers more rights. At its best, TTIP could lead the way toward a new high-road trade model.  Or it could be another corporate dominated trade deal.Let me clearly say again: We are not anti-trade.We would gladly embrace a good trade agreement.  And we continue to hope that in light of the breakdown in the TPP talks that there will be some rethinking.  We have said again and again that there are a set of key problems with TPP:We are ready to dive in on these issues.  And we are ready to hold our elected representatives—and those who seek to hold public office—accountable on trade.A new model of global trade could and should lift wages and improve lives, and so usher in an era of stable, wage-driven growth and shared prosperity.I doubt TPP will meet that standard. What we’ve seen so far is that U.S. negotiators don’t yet understand the new model. They’re stuck in the past with an out-of-date blueprint for failure.We will continue to engage in negotiations to improve both of these agreements to make them acceptable. If that happens, great. If not, we’ll run campaigns to defeat them.We will be ready, either way. Thank you. And God bless you. I look forward to your questions.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka

",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-labor-day-we-wont-be-denied,9-7-2015,"Happy Labor Day everybody!I want to start by saying a few words about the Vice President.  Joe and I are both products of this great state.  He is a friend, a brother, and a great champion of working men and women.  It is an honor to be standing with him today.Vice President Biden knows that Pittsburgh and Allegheny County are leading America toward the future with one word: Organize!I want to thank every worker here who organized to form a union.  You stood up for yourself.  You stood up for your coworkers.  You stood up for your community.  You stood up for America. You’re helping America today, right here, by organizing at Allegheny General Hospital and Allegheny County Community College and Point Park.  You’re doing it in education and on the river boats and among security guards.  You’re doing it with AFT and SEIU and the Operating Engineers and the Steelworkers and Unite HERE and the Carpenters.When we organize, we’re working for a better life.  A better life that starts with raising wages.  We want raising wages and everything that comes with it.  Good pay, great benefits, fair schedules, paid sick leave and a voice on the job.  We know the best way to raise wages is to organize.  The best ladder to the middle class is a collective bargaining agreement.Pittsburgh has a powerful history of collective action and a powerful future.  You’re building that future.  How?  It’s simple: Organize! Organize! Organize!Once we organize, we bargain.  I know many of you are in the middle of tough negotiations.  Whether you are reaching your first contract or looking for a better one, now is the time to stick together.  Now is the time to stand together.  Now is the time to march together.We’ll stand up.  We’ll march.  We’ll raise our voices.  The CEOs, and none more than the CEOs of US Steel and ATI, want us to sit down and shut up.  They want us to sit back and shove off.But we’re not going to sit down or back up, and we sure as hell won’t shut up…. We’ll fight US Steel and ATI and anyone else who stands in our way, because we’re the American labor movement, and we won’t be denied!We’ll march together. We’ll stand together. We’ll register together. We’ll vote together. And then we’ll win together! We’ll win together!

354,Trumka Talks Transportation at Machinists' Conference,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-talks-transportation-machinists-conference,8-25-2015,"Thank you Sito [Pantoja] for that kind introduction.  Hello Machinists!  It is great to be with you today.I am extremely proud of this union.  You organize.  You bargain good contracts.  You stand up for what is right.It is the Machinists who are fighting for a 10 hour rest period for flight attendants.It is the Machinists who are demanding that the FAA stop aircraft maintenance from being done in foreign counties.It is the Machinists who are working to make it easier for workers in the airline and railroad sectors to organize.Working men and women have no better champion than the transportation professionals in this room.  You are the best in the world.  You help move our goods and our people. You take pride in your work at our airports and on our railroads.You are the definition of solidarity. You know that working people, sticking together, built the greatest economic engine in the history of the world.Unfortunately, not everyone sees it that way.  CEOs are doing everything in their power to lower wages and gut benefits.  They don’t want work to pay. They want work to hurt. They want to lower our wages, take our pensions and health care, squeeze every ounce of productivity out of us, and then toss us aside.And they want to take away our right to organize, bargain collectively, and go on strike.These CEOs want us to back down, back off, sit down, and shut up.Brothers and sisters, we will never back down.  We will never back off.  We will never sit down. We will never shut up.We have created an agenda for shared prosperity. It’s called Raising Wages. Raising wages is what we’re all about.  It’s how we lift up our families and our communities.  And it comes from activism and the collective voice.This agenda is about much more than wages, though.  It’s about what wages represent.  It’s a philosophy, a vision, and a plan all rolled into one.  It starts with the absolute truth that no one should make less than the minimum wage, everyone should make a living wage, and collective bargaining should be available for all workers.  But it goes far broader and deeper than that. Raising wages means trade policies that lift incomes in America and around the world.  It means strong, modern labor laws that give everyone who works a real opportunity to bargain for higher wages without fear.  It means allowing workers to demand and win fair work schedules, paid sick leave, and overtime paychecks.Raising wages is why all of us in this room are standing strong against Norwegian Air.We’ve seen it time and time again.  Global companies try to find the cheapest labor possible to increase their bottom lines.  But Norwegian Air has taken this low-road approach to whole new level.The airline is registered in Ireland to avoid Norway’s labor laws, even though it does not service Irish airports.And it is hiring flight crews from low-wage Thailand that are employed through a recruitment firm in Singapore.Look how complicated they are making it.  It’s like a 3 dimensional chess game, all to avoid treating workers fairly.Make no mistake, Norwegian Air does not have the right to undermine fair competition by scouring the globe for the cheapest labor and weakest regulations.And it certainly does not have the right to violate current trade agreements at the expense of our airline workers.So as long as I have a voice, I will be using it to tell the Department of Transportation to stop Norwegian Air’s anti-worker scheme.Raising wages is why we’re speaking out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  I want to thank you for everything you did to defeat Fast Track.  We could not have waged that fight—and nearly won it—without the leadership of the Machinists.You helped move the dial because you brought pressure.  You held elected leaders accountable.Democratic, Republican, Independent, whatever, working people are tired of these damn bad trade deals full of corporate entitlements.  They’ve been killing jobs and weakening our country for far too long.The Wall Street and Washington elite always tell us that this time will be different.  President Obama called the TPP “the most progressive trade deal in history.”  That’s like calling Jeb the most progressive Bush in history.  It sounds nice but could we possibly set the bar any lower?The truth is these trade deals have ripped apart the fabric of our nation.  You know it and I know it.  We’ve seen the shuttered factories.  We’ve visited the towns that look like they are stuck in the 1970s.  We’ve talked to the workers who lost everything, only to be told they should retrain in another field.And let’s be real, our trade policies are a bipartisan failure.  For three decades, Democrats and Republicans have sold us down the river.  From NAFTA to CAFTA to Korea and now the TPP, our elected officials have continually put profits over people.  That’s why we fought so hard against fast track.  We were fighting for the future of the American Dream.Now I know we fell a little short.  But we forever changed the trade debate in this country.  Our opponents thought the TPP was a slam dunk.  It was supposed to be finished by now.  But as of today there is still no agreement.Brothers and sisters, we did that.  We slowed down the entire process.  And if it comes up for a vote, we are going to kill the TPP once and for all. Raising wages is our measuring stick for the 2016 election.  I know your union recently endorsed Hillary Clinton.  I respect Hillary.  I especially admire the way she is standing strong in the face of all the crap being thrown at her by the right-wing and the media.As you know, the AFL-CIO has not yet made an endorsement.  But we are not sitting back.  We are asking all of the presidential candidates what actions they will take to make our economy fairer for working families.We are also crystal clear that we do not work for any political party or candidate.  We work for working people, plain and simple, because we want the freedom to live better lives, to take care of our families and to improve our jobs and our communities.Brothers and sisters, for too long we’ve worked for the Democratic Party.  It is time to start making the Democratic Party start working for us.A big part of our raising wages agenda is collective bargaining.  And let me tell you, collective bargaining is on the rise.  This year 5 million union workers are negotiating contracts.  This is the biggest year for bargaining in American history.  So why is this important?In the first six months of this year alone, working people in all kinds of jobs have won an average pay increase of 4.3 percent the old-fashioned way—by demanding it.  By standing in solidarity for it.You are demonstrating that solidarity as we speak.  I want to commend the Machinists and the Transport Workers Union for putting their differences aside and forming a joint association to bargain with the newly merged American Airlines.  Instead of fighting each other, you are working together.  This association brings together two great transportation unions and avoids costly and bitter representation fights.  You put the members first and for that I say thank you.You will soon begin joint contract bargaining for 30,000 ground workers at American.  It will be the single largest negotiation in the airline industry.  Next year, you will do the same for 28,000 ground workers at United.  These negotiations will set the tone for years to come.  I want you to know the AFL-CIO will have your back throughout this entire process.  And my message to American and United is this: we helped you pull through the hard times.  Profits are rising.  We expect our wages and benefits to rise with them.  We want our fair share.Raising wages also means investing in our infrastructure.  We built the interstate highways, the transcontinental railroads, and a vast network of transit and maritime systems.Yet at a time when our roads and bridges are falling apart and public transportation is underfunded, at a time when our airports remain in desperate need of upgrades and Amtrak is operating on virtual bankruptcy budgets, Congress continues to tinker around the edges.We need to go big.  I’m talking trillions with a T.  I want the best infrastructure in the world—and I want you to help build it.  Investing in infrastructure is the smart thing to do.  It will make your jobs better.  It will create new jobs.  And it will have economic benefits across the supply chain—what people in transportation like to call the multiplier effect.  So it is long past time for our elected officials to get off their butts and do something about it.Let me close with a story.  I remember back when my son Rich was young—maybe three or four years old.  His grandfather had gotten him one of those battery operated jeeps.  You parents know what I’m talking about.  He and his buddy Chad were driving around in the backyard.I was out there too—talking on the phone about what else—the union.  Rich must have overheard me because he drove up and said: “Dad what’s a union?”So I told him to try to push his jeep up the hill in our backyard.  He strained and struggled, but he couldn’t get it up the hill.  Then I told his friend Chad to give him a hand.  Working together, they got the job done.  I looked right at my son and said: “That’s a union.”Today working men and women are climbing up their own hill.  Wages are too low.  Benefits are too few.  Retirement security is less than secure.Working people are struggling to get by.  Some have given up hope all together.And the corporate right-wing is waging the most sophisticated anti-worker campaign we have ever seen.But even in the face of these enormous challenges, I remain optimistic for one reason: you.The Koch Brothers and Scott Walker can spend all the money in the world, but they do not have the men and women in this room.They do not have the millions of union members and their families who are ready to stand up and fight for what is right.I will take our might over their money any day of the week.When we work together, there is no challenge too difficult, no obstacle too great, no hill too steep.So brothers and sisters, pledge with me today that we’ll fight together.  We’ll organize together. We’ll mobilize together.  And we’ll win together.Thank you!  God bless you, and the work you do.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
355,"Trumka to Iowa AFL-CIO Delegates: ""America needs your activism.""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-iowa-afl-cio-delegates-america-needs-your-activism,8-6-2015,"Thank you, Ken [Sagar] for your kind words of introduction, and for inviting me to speak at your convention. It’s great to be back in Iowa.Let me start by acknowledging our brothers and sisters in the midst of tough negotiations. We have bakery workers in Cedar Rapids whose contract expired this past weekend. The way forward won’t be easy, but I want to thank the local Building Trades in particular and all the other unions that have stood in solidarity with BCTGM. And I want the workers who are fighting for a fair contract to know the entire AFL-CIO has their back.You’ve got a lot of good things going on here in Iowa. Your State Fed is growing stronger with new affiliations and new members. You are engaging with community partners and helping to keep our shared priorities in the public eye. We saw the power of this coalition at the Iowa Working Families Summit in May, which brought together progressive activists to rally support for our Raising Wages agenda, and to set the tone for the 2016 election.I also want to mention the Ames Organizing Project. With coalition partners and community support, you are organizing new members and building powerful momentum for a labor movement in a place that desperately needs it. I’m told you’ve got two new public employee units in the process of certification, and four active drives at private employers. That’s progress.You know better than I do that Iowa working families have a unique ability to shape the national debate as we head into the next presidential election. I can’t tell you how proud I am to see candidates talking about working family issues. Even Jeb Bush has tried to chime in. Now, he can’t pass the laugh test, but he should feel pressure to be accountable to working people, and you’ve done a lot to raise that pressure. Thank you.Last week, at the AFL-CIO Executive Council meeting, we hosted five presidential candidates. Each one spoke and took questions for an hour. We had Mike Huckabee, Hillary Clinton, Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb, and Bernie Sanders.Let me tell you, the EC’s enthusiasm for the Raising Wages agenda is through the roof. Those candidates felt it. They heard it. They responded.This is important. We are crystal clear with these candidates about one thing: We do not work for any political party or any candidate. We work for working people. Period. We want the freedom to live better lives, to take care of our families and to improve our jobs and our communities.But corporate CEOs see it differently. They want to tear down working people. These CEOs are doing everything possible to lower pay and ruin benefits in Iowa and all across our country, but we have a better vision. We’re focused on fixing America, with unionism and political action.  We can raise wages. This is a popular idea. This is a mainstream idea. This is an American idea.So get on your feet, brothers and sisters!  This is how we rise. With political independence. With action for working people. By standing together. Today, tomorrow and as long as it takes. Together. With all workers, all families and everyone who believes in the American Dream!Listen, you’ve done a lot of mobilizing over the past few years, but I especially appreciate all the hard work you’ve done fighting Fast Track, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership these past months. We’re not done, not by a long shot, and all across the country our activists have made a difference turning yes votes into no votes.You helped move the dial because you brought pressure. You held elected leaders accountable.Democratic, Republican, Independent, whatever, working people are tired of these damn bad trade deals full of corporate entitlements. They’ve been killing jobs and weakening our country for far too long.Iowa doesn’t like bad trade deals. The American people don’t like bad trade, and we are making our voices heard. Fast Track may have squeaked by, but listen close, we have forever changed the trade debate in America. It will never be the same. We will fight TPP. We intend to beat it. And mark my words, we are building very real, permanent power for a new America, and we’re not stopping.We’re working for a better life. We’re showing America that raising wages can work.America needs your activism, now more than ever.Iowa voters, just like working families all over this country, are independent people, yet we share common values. We have a common vision. We want work to pay. We want fairness. We want what’s best for our families and each other.That’s why the AFL-CIO has taken such a strong stand for political independence. That’s why we pledged to freeze our political spending this spring to campaign against Fast Track. I don’t care who wants that deal …. I’m against it.We know what doesn’t work for America—bad trade deals—and we know what does—collective bargaining.The single best way to raise wages is with collective bargaining agreements. The labor movement remains the backbone of the American middle class. We embrace that fact, and that’s how we always know who stands with us and who stands against us.This year 5 million union workers are bargaining contracts. This is the biggest year for collective bargaining in American history. We helped our employers pull through in the hard times. Profits are up. Stocks are climbing. So now, we want a fair share.In the first six months of this year alone, working people in all kinds of jobs have won an average 4.3% pay increase the old-fashioned way—by asking for it. Other contracts will follow.That’s not all. Over the past few months, higher minimum wages have been going into effect all across the country. Fast food workers won a $15 minimum wage in New York and for the first time in history federal legislation was proposed at the same level.And this spring, 2 million retail workers stood together and won raises from Walmart and Target and Marshalls and TJ Maxx. When Ikea raised wages, the results were so good they raised wages again.Our work raising wages has opened millions of eyes. People are getting bigger paychecks, and you know how good that feels!Last month, our unions helped convince the White House to propose updated overtime rules so millions of people can get paid for ALL the work they actually do! And if it is adopted, overtime pay will account for rising prices for the first time since the 1970s. It’s about time!Raising wages is how we lift up our families and our communities.Raising wages is what we do.And raising wages will kick-start the greatest engine of economic growth the world has ever seen… a well-paid American workforce!Raising wages comes from activism and the collective voice. That’s big.And if some is good, more is better! We want more! We want better! We want raising wages! We want a better life!Brothers and sisters, it’s incredibly important for us to do everything in our power to raise wages. It starts with us and it starts here in Iowa.We’re building collective power in the workplace, in the economy and in politics. It’s critical for all of us to continue member-to-member organizing, to keep building our central labor councils and state federations of labor, and to keep engaging with community allies.  In all of these areas, I want you to lead by example. Make sure your members see you and hear you.We’re part of a powerful movement at an historic time … and you are on the front lines. After this convention, when you go back home, you’ll be better prepared with what you gain here, to push our movement forward. The next election cycle is just around the corner. We’re building for it. We’re ready for it. When we unite with allies and partners, the numbers are on our side. When we stand together with those who share our vision and our values, the numbers are on our side.This is our day, our time, our rights, one voice, one power, one country. We will do better. Together.So declare with me today … we’ll march for it. We’ll fight for it.  We’ll organize for it. And mobilize for it.  We’ll keep building and winning, winning a better future for us and for our kids and their kids. Together today. Together tomorrow. Together for as long as it takes to reclaim an America that works for all workers!Thank you! God bless you, and the work you do!

356,Trumka to Union Sportsmen’s Alliance: We Bring Workers Together,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-union-sportsmens-alliance-we-bring-workers-together,7-28-2015,"Brothers and sisters, thank you for being here and for supporting two of my favorite things: unionism and the great outdoors.  I’m proud to be the chairman of the USA board and the very first member of the Union Sportsmen’s Alliance.  Here’s my proof: my card is 000001.Many of you in this room were here just one short year ago, and since that time we’ve done some pretty special things.  We’ve got some reasons to be proud.  Let me tell you. The USA has more than 200,000 active members, and that makes us the fastest-growing nonprofit conservation organization in the United States.  That’s news!We continue to produce an award winning television show called Brotherhood Outdoors, and every episode tells a positive story about hardworking union sportsmen and sports women.We have raised money and brought together thousands of union members at more than 45 fundraising shoots and conservation dinners.And here’s what we should be most proud of: in the last few years, the USA has completed more than 52 Work Boots on the Ground projects throughout North America.  Fifteen in just the first six months of this year.Last year, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell stood right here with Fred [Myers] and me to launch a joint effort by the AFL-CIO, the USA and the Interior Department, to improve and enhance wild lands in America and, since that time, volunteers from IBEW Local 80 helped build an elevated boardwalk through a cypress marsh at a wildlife refuge in Virginia, and you’ll be glad to know we’ve got other joint projects in the works in Wisconsin, Texas and Minnesota.You see, the USA brings workers of various trades together at every level, from the international to the local.  We bring today’s workers together with the next generation, and together we do good work through the Work Boots on the Ground program.  We contribute skilled union labor and financial support, and we literally build and repair bridges in state parks, and we improve and restore wildlife habitat.  We upgrade infrastructure like trails, ramps, docks and shelters.  We encourage youth to get outdoors and then we mentor them.  This is important for a lot of reasons.  It helps our unions connect with our members and it also helps foster relationships from trade to trade.  It gives our members a sense of pride.  Our conservation efforts are also good for our communities, and together we generate positive news about unions for local newspapers and TV stations.Let’s give a big round of applause to all of the union volunteers around this country who make this work possible!I’m proud to say we have another first.Just a couple months ago, the USA received our first corporate grant from American Water Charitable Foundation.  American Water is the largest publicly traded utility in the country, and more than half its workers are union.  That grant money will help us complete projects in Illinois, Tennessee and West Virginia.American Water’s CEO Susan Story and President Walter Lynch are here with us today.Susan and Walter, I want to thank you and everyone at American Water for stepping up as USA’s first corporate foundation to support this wonderful program.Your grant will improve local parks and communities, and it will also continue to build bridges between union members and the community, and will also raise the profile of union members in America.Please join me in a round of applause for American Water!As I said a minute ago, the USA is growing fast.  We’re adding members, and this year so far we’ve also added three new unions as Charter Unions.  I’m talking about the Utility Workers, who also make up more than 50% of the employees of American Water!  President Michael Langford is here with us this evening, and let’s hear it for the Utility Workers!I’m also talking about the United Auto Workers, who became a Charter Union earlier this year. President Dennis Williams is with us this evening, so let’s hear it for the UAW!  Thank you, Dennis.We’re also proud to welcome the Laborers’ back to the USA as a Charter Union.  Rod Bennett is here representing the Laborers’, and I would like to hear it for them as well.  Thank you, Rod!I also want to give a special shout out to the Ironworkers, the Fire Fighters, and my own union, the UMWA, for being the first unions outside the USA Board of Directors to host a fundraising shoot, or dinner, to support the organization.We are here tonight to celebrate the fact that Labor has a new and powerful tool to unite our union community.  I’m talking about the Union Sportsmen’s Alliance, and I couldn’t be happier about what we’ve achieved so far.But I have to tell you, all this is possible only because of the people who share this vision and are willing to work hard to make it a reality, and as I look around I see a room filled with individuals who are committed to the success of the Union Sportsmen’s Alliance.I want everyone here from one of our Charter Unions to raise your hand. Thank you!And now I want everyone who has ever sponsored a shoot to raise your hand. That’s great!If you have participated in Work Boots on the Ground, raise your hand and give a shout!If you sponsored the TV show, raise your hand and make some noise!If you’re a USA founding partner, raise your hand!If you are a USA staff member, please raise your hand!How about a huge round of applause for all of the partners in this room who have helped us create such a powerful organization.Now listen, if you haven’t raised your hand, don’t worry, because I promise we’ll be signing you up for something soon, and you’ll be raising your hand next year!  Thank you for coming!  God bless you and the work you do!

357,"Trumka to Utility Workers: ""We are at a turning point."" ",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-utility-workers-we-are-turning-point,7-22-2015,"Thank you, Brother Mike [Langford], for your kind words of introduction, and thank you for inviting me to your convention.Before I start, I want to commend you on becoming a charter member of the Union Sportsmen Alliance.  As you know, I am also a proud supporter of the USA, so this is an exciting development.It’s great to be with you today.  The Utility Workers always fight for what’s right.  And you always know how to win.This is a big year for the Utility Workers.  You have been lifting up lives and empowering America for 70 years.  You have built one hell of a strong record.  You are a cornerstone of the American economy.  You literally keep the gas flowing, the lights on and the water running.  We count on our utilities, and you deliver, always.  Your jobs are good jobs, with good pay and benefits and a secure retirement.  Those are the basic ingredients of the American middle class. Congratulations!  Keep up the good work.So listen, a couple years ago, I went out to a Utility Workers rally at a power plant in southeast Ohio.  It was good to be there, because I come from a coal-mining family in Southwest Pennsylvania.  It felt a little bit like home.  I saw your work ethic.  I listened to what your members had to say, and it reminded me how important our work is, whether it’s in the plant, in the union hall, or in our communities.  Your members are independent people, and that’s true across our labor movement.  We don’t want someone telling us what to feel or how to think, but we share common values.  We have a common vision.  We want work to pay.  We want fairness.  We want to provide for our families and our future.That’s why the AFL-CIO has taken such a strong stand up in Washington for political independence.  That’s why we pledged to freeze our political spending this spring, while we campaigned against bad trade deals full of corporate entitlements.  I don’t care who wants that deal.  I’m against it.  We stand against it.  Our labor movement belongs only to us, not to any political party.We support President Obama when he does the right thing, like making sure more workers get overtime pay, or appointing straight-forward and fair people to the National Labor Relations Board.  But when he wants to take America in the wrong direction, we will stand against him. His push for the Trans-Pacific Partnership is wrong.  It’ll hurt the American economy.  It’ll hurt working families.  And we’re going to beat it.It’s true that the corporate forces won the battle for fast track trade authority.  But just barely. They pulled strings and tricks and still only won by a hair.  That kind of maneuvering is a show of weakness, and stands in stark contrast to the movement we are building.  Our strength is growing, and we’re not stopping.  Smart members of Congress are reconsidering this issue, and changing to the right side.  And more are on the way.Earlier this month, the AFL-CIO sent letters to 28 Democrats in the House and 13 Democrats in the Senate, all who voted the wrong way on Fast Track, letting them know they still have a chance to do the right thing by voting against the TPP.  The TPP is full of stuff that is bad for working people, bad for the environment, bad for food safety, and the list goes on.Democratic, Republican, Independent, whatever, working people are tired of these damn bad trade deals.  They’ve been killing jobs and weakening our country for far too long.Fast Track squeaked by, but our labor movement has forever changed the trade debate in America—and that is going to help us win.  Mark my words.  We are building real, permanent power for a new America.We know what we stand for.  We believe in fairness and the freedom to live a good life.  And we know what we stand against, and we’re not afraid to hold accountable any politician who harms working families.This is how we rise.  With political independence.  With action for working people.  By standing together.  Today, tomorrow and as long as it takes.  This is how we win.  This is how we all rise. Together.  With all workers, all families and everyone who believes in the American Dream!Brothers and sisters, this is an important time in American politics.  We are at a turning point.For forty years, working people have been torn apart, and our middle class has been torn down. For the first time in a long time, working people have started standing together again.  I want to thank you for helping to make that happen, and I’m asking you to do more.  There are many ways to be involved, in your union, in your neighborhood, in politics.  We need it all!All across America, the story is the same.  Corporate power is consolidating.  CEOs have long since grown reckless and greedy.  Just look at the utility industry.  We have allowed relatively small companies to merge into giants that have become too big to regulate.  The last time the industry was this bad was in 1932, when only three utility holding companies controlled half of America’s investor-owned utilities.That kind of concentrated power isn’t sustainable.  It’s unstable.That’s why the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was passed to limit the damage unregulated utilities could do.  Ten years ago, it was repealed, and we’re starting to see the consequences.The biggest mergers yet are still coming down the pike.  If they go ahead, it won’t be good for the public, and it won’t be good for your members.  These CEOs want to tear you down, destroy your pay and wreck your healthcare and retirement.  These CEOs put profit ahead of service. They didn’t come up in the industry.  They don’t even know how to turn a wrench.Brothers and sisters, we’re not waiting for the utility giants to swallow our country.  That’s not how we do it in America.  We’re standing up.  We’re fighting back.America needs your activism.  Power plants are closing.  Clean coal technology isn’t coming forward fast enough.  We’re going to change that.  America will need a base load of coal-fired electrical generation now and for the foreseeable future.  We know we can capture and store carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels, and the AFL-CIO is committed to making sure this technology comes into the marketplace.That’s not all.  What you do for a living is important, and your work can and should provide good jobs for generations to come.  The key is programs like Power for America, which teaches skills that can’t be gained any other way.  This is how Utility Workers will have a future in America.  We’re going to fight to make sure it’s a good future, the kind you’d want for your children and your children’s children.It’s simple: You are working for a better life.Your training program and our efforts to win strong infrastructure investments all fit into the top priority we have at the AFL-CIO.We’re working for a better life in 100 ways, and they’re all tied together.  They build on each other, but it all comes back to raising wages.We know the single best way to raise wages is with collective bargaining agreements.  The labor movement remains the backbone of the American middle class.  We never shrink from that fact, and we always know who stands with us and who stands against us when we speak loud and proud about being union.This year 5 million union workers are bargaining contracts.  This is the biggest year for collective bargaining in American history.  We helped our employers pull through in the hard times.  Profits are up.  Stocks are climbing.  We want our fair share.That’s not all.Minimum wages are climbing in cities and states across the country.And across America this spring, 2 million retail workers stood together and won raises from Walmart and Target and Marshalls and TJ Maxx, and that’s just the big stores.When Ikea raised wages, the results were so good they raised wages again.  This just happened a few weeks ago.Our work for raising wages has helped galvanize the unprecedented fight against Fast Track trade authority.  It has opened the eyes of millions of workers who have seen the collective voice in action, and millions of workers have won raises as a result.  People are getting bigger paychecks, and you know how good that feels!Now the White House has put forth overtime rules that will allow millions of people to get paid for the overtime they are already working!  And for the first time since the 1970s, overtime pay will account for inflation.  It’s about time!Raising wages is how we lift up our families and our communities.  Raising wages is what we do.  And raising wages will kick-start the greatest engine of economic growth the world has ever seen, a well-paid American workforce!Raising wages comes from activism and the collective voice.  That’s big.And if some is good, more is better!                                                                             We want more!  We want better!  We want raising wages!  We want a better life!Brothers and sisters, it’s incredibly important for us to do everything in our power to raise wages. That’s how we will literally reclaim, retrain, repower and repair America.We’re building collective power in the workplace, in the economy and in politics.  We have opened our movement to new partners.  This is one reason why it’s so critical for more Utility Workers to get involved in member-to-member organizing and with your central labor councils and state federations of labor.  Lead by example.  Make sure your members see you and hear you.We are fighting for what America needs.  We want massive investments in America’s infrastructure.  I’m talking trillions with a T.  We’re going to need a broad and bold coalition to win this kind of legislation.  We’ll get it by teaming with partners and allies.  Mark my words.We’re part of a powerful movement at an historic time, and you are on the front lines.  After this convention, when you go back home, you’ll be better prepared with what you gain here, to push our movement forward.  The next election cycle is just around the corner.  It’s time to think hard about our priorities, and to start to build toward them.The corporate right-wing will challenge us at every turn. But we’ll fight to win anyway.  We’ll fight to build power.  That means more internal organizing.  More conversations and listening sessions with members, more face-to-face meetings with community leaders and allies.Because nobody and nothing can match the breadth and scope of the American labor movement. When we unite with allies and partners, the numbers are on our side.  When we stand together with those who share our vision and our values, the numbers are on our side.This is our day, our time, our rights, one voice, one power, one country.  We will do better. Together.So declare with me today that we’ll march for it.  We’ll fight for it.  We’ll organize for it and mobilize for it.  We’ll keep building and winning, winning a better future for us and for our kids and their kids.  Together today.  Together tomorrow.  Together for as long as it takes to reclaim an America that works for all workers!Thank you!  God bless you, and the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
358,"Trumka to Texas AFL-CIO Delegates: ""You've done the hard work.""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-texas-afl-cio-delegates-youve-done-hard-work,7-17-2015,"Thank you, Sister Becky [Moeller], for your kind words of introduction, and thank you for inviting me to your convention.  It’s great to be back in Texas.I want to tell you here in front of your delegates how much I appreciate all the work we’ve done together over the years.  You’re the best kind of fighter, because you find ways to win.This is a bittersweet moment for me, to be perfectly frank, because I’m happy for you that you’re retiring, but I’ll miss your voice, your advocacy and your passion.Congratulations to you, and I wish you the best down in Corpus Christi.Brothers and sisters, make no mistake.  The labor movement in Texas is growing, even though it’s one of the toughest states for workers to organize.  Your labor movement under Becky’s leadership has lifted up thousands more families.  You’ve made a difference in regular people’s lives, and you’ve done it despite ironclad opposition and one of the worst political climates for working people in the country.So once again, congratulations to you, Becky, on a long and successful career, and congratu-lations to all of you, and also to John Patrick for stepping up to head the state AFL-CIO here in Austin.  I look forward to working more with you.This is an important time in Texas politics.  Last year, Democrats in this state took one of the worst beatings on record, despite a real effort to register new voters and talk about working family issues.  Moving the needle for working families in Texas is a challenge, and it’s going to be hard.  Texas is one of the few states where you can actually still go to jail just for trying to register someone to vote.Changing the political climate in Texas is difficult, but we have to find a way to win anyway.Right here in this room, we’ve got a lot of union experience, and a lot of political experience. You know how important and difficult it is for working men and women to stand together, not just in election years and during contract fights, but day in and day out.  You know how tough it is to follow every organizing lead.  Some of them don’t pan out, but taking up each lead is the only way to find the ones that do.  You’ve done the hard work.  You’ve made your unions work, and you’ve made your communities and your state stronger.Make no mistake.  America is turning once again toward the core values of unionism.  It’s not happening on its own, and it may not happen as fast or in exactly the way as we’d like, but it is happening.  National polls show the portion of people who approve of unions is rising, and those who disapprove are falling.
The power of the collective voice in America is rising.  Texas AFT organized new members in Waco in September.  Two more locals will likely come online next spring, one north of San Antonio and another down in the Valley.  And there are two more organizing committees making plans.  Teachers across Texas are standing together for a better life. That’s powerful. This year, we’ve seen Texas Steelworkers stand up and stand strong for safety and fair treatment on the job.You’re showing Texas and America how solidarity can lift all of us up.  Not just some.  All.This year, all across America, 5 million working people in America are bargaining together for better wages and benefits.  It’s one of the biggest years for contract bargaining on record.And listen, it’s not just workers with unions who are standing together.  In Texas and across America, 2 million retail workers stood together and won raises from Walmart and Target and Marshalls and TJ Maxx, and that’s just the big stores.When Ikea raised wages, the results were so good they raised wages again.  This just happened a few weeks ago.Raising wages is how we lift up our families and our communities.  Raising wages is what we do.  And raising wages will kick-start the greatest engine of economic growth the world has ever seen -- a well-paid American workforce!Raising wages comes from activism and the collective voice.  That’s big.  Those are wins!And if some is good, more is better!We want more!  We want better!  We want raising wages!You know we’ve been battling over international trade in the past few months.  I appreciate the hard work you’ve done fighting Fast Track and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  I know you’ll keep fighting, and I know you’ve made a difference in your delegation.  You turned yes votes into no votes.I’d like to thank the Congressional Democrats from Texas who stood with us in this fight.  I’d like to particularly thank Lloyd Doggett for his leadership.  Lloyd is a true champion for working families and an important voice on trade.The sober truth is that the corporate traders barely won the battle for fast track trade authority. They pulled strings and jumped hoops and won by a hair, but we’ve only been picking up steam. We’re not stopping.  Members of Congress are reconsidering this issue, and coming to our side. More are on the way.That’s happening because you held elected leaders accountable.  You turned out in person, looked them in the eye and told them your priorities.  You were the very best of democracy.Democratic, Republican, Independent, whatever, working people are tired of these damn bad trade deals full of corporate entitlements.  They’ve been killing jobs and weakening our country for far too long.The American people don’t like bad trade, and we are making our voices heard.  Fast Track may have squeaked by, but we have forever changed the trade debate in America—and that is going to help us fight the TPP.  Mark my words.  We are building very real, permanent power for a new America, and we’re not stopping.We saw this power in your successful work here in Austin against the overreach of the corporate right-wing.  I’m talking about bad ideas that died but should never have been brought forward in the first place, like Senate Bill 1968.  In the last session, you also fought off attacks on prevailing wages and PLAs.Win, lose or draw, we can gain power in these fights.  When you stand up publicly for a higher minimum wage, the lawmakers in charge might throw it down, but low-wage workers across the state can see and hear you fighting to improve their lives.That’s important, because Texas is a national leader in low-wage work.  If the minimum wage rose to $10.10 an hour, almost 2 million Texas workers would see a pay increase.  That’s as many workers as 20 other states combined.  And if you look closer at those minimum-wage earners, you’ll see that here in Texas, 65% are women -- two out of three workers who earn the minimum wage in Texas are women.You know that the minimum wage is only one part of the fight to raise wages.  When you speak for immigration reform, when you speak for prison reform, when you speak for equal pay for equal work, you’re working to raise wages—and you’re building bridges to allies and partner organizations.That’s how, even in a loss today, we can build a bridge to win tomorrow.To win we need fair work schedules.  We need safe working conditions.  We need higher wages, better benefits, and more rights at work.  All of us, teachers and building and construction workers, and domestic workers.This is how we rise.  This is how we bring with us all the workers, all the families and all who believe in the American Dream!We’re part of a powerful movement at an historic moment, and you are on the front lines.  After this convention, when you go back home, you’ll be better prepared with what you gain here, to push our movement forward.The next election cycle is just around the corner.  It’s time to think hard about our priorities, and to start to build toward them.The corporate right-wing will challenge us at every turn. But we’ll fight to win anyway.  We’ll fight to build power.  That means more internal organizing.  More conversations and listening sessions with members, more face-to-face meetings with community leaders and allies.Because nobody and nothing can match the breadth and scope of the American labor movement. When we unite with allies and partners, the numbers are on our side.  When we stand together with those who share our vision and our values, the numbers are on our side.This is our day, our time, our rights, one voice, one power, one country.  We will do better. Together.So declare with me today that we’ll march for it.  We’ll fight for it.  We’ll organize for it and mobilize for it.  We’ll keep building and winning, winning a better future for us and for our kids and their kids.  Together today.  Together tomorrow.  Together for as long as it takes to win a country that works for all workers!Thank you! God bless you, and the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
359,"Trumka: Protect Medicare, Strengthen Social Security",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-protect-medicare-strengthen-social-security,7-7-2015,"Brothers and sisters, it’s good to have so many seasoned labor leaders and activists in our nation’s capital.  Seasoned, how do you like that word?  My seasoning is salt and pepper.  More salt than pepper.  But if you look hard, you’ll still find some pepper.Seriously, though, it is good to have all of you in Washington.  I know you’ve gathered from across the country, and I know you’ve been doing important work back in your home states, essential work.  You’ve been growing the Alliance for Retired Americans.  You’re on the move. You’re chartered in, what is it?  36 states?  That’s powerful.  And you’ve stood up strong for our vision of a world where work is rewarded fairly, for a nation built on broadly shared prosperity, for a Raising Wages economy that builds better lives for all of us, not just the chosen few.Together, in this room, we have a lot of union experience.  You know how important it is for working men and women to stand together, not just in the big election years and during contract fights, but day in and day out.  You’ve done the hard work.  You’ve made your unions work, and your communities stronger.It is so important for us, as we turn our entire country toward the core values of unionism, that you and your members continue to lead the way.  You do it when you turn out for rallies in your hometown.  You do it when you volunteer at a phone bank.  You do it when you’re active in your labor councils and federations of labor.This is how we pass along generational knowledge.  This is how you show younger members and community allies that our unions lift up all working people.  Not just some.  All.We stand with carwash workers and taxi drivers, with domestic workers and retail workers, as well as factory workers, office workers, airline pilots and nurses.  And whenever one group of workers is down, we are all there to help them up, because we are all truly connected.Raising wages is how we lift up our families and our communities.  And raising wages will kick-start the greatest engine of economic growth the world has ever seen, a well-paid American workforce!In one day this spring, one 24-hour period, Communication Workers and Electrical Workers in New England won raises, and Communication Workers in Brooklyn won a first contract with strong wage increases, and over the course of a few short weeks, 2 million non-union workers won raises from Walmart and a half-dozen national retailers.  These wins came through activism and a collective voice.  That’s big.  That’s real.  When IKEA raised wages across the board, the results were so good they raised pay again!  Those are wins!About those wage wins, I like to say, if some is good, more is better!We want more!  We want better!  We want raising wages!Listen, I appreciate the hard work you’ve done fighting Fast Track and the Trans-Pacific Partnership these past months.  I know you’ll keep fighting.We’re done with these damn bad trade deals full of corporate entitlements.  They’ve been killing jobs and weakening America for far too long.The American people don’t like bad trade, but some of the politicians on Capitol Hill aren’t listening.  Your voice on this issue is powerful, and when we fight TPP we’re building power. You are building power.  It doesn’t depend on winning or losing a vote in the Senate.  We’re building very real, permanent power for a new America, and we’re not stopping.So I appreciate all that you’ve done.  You’ve stood strong to raise the minimum wage and to fight for affordable prescription drugs for seniors.  You’re ready to protect Medicare from the voucherizing Rep. Paul Ryan.  He’s so bad he’s created a new word!  Voucherizing!  You’ve raised your voices to strengthen, not simply defend, but strengthen Social Security.  And let me be clear about this, crystal clear, when I say strengthen Social Security, I mean with money, so it can pay out more benefits longer.When you take your ideas to Capitol Hill on Thursday, you’ll be telling the politicians there that we intend to hold them accountable for the votes they take, and the decisions they make.We’re watching, and we vote.And if anyone asks you why retirees want to raise the minimum wage, tell them some seniors are working for minimum wage today, because they can’t afford not to.  Tell them raising wages will increase opportunity for workers of all ages.  With higher wages, those workers will pay more taxes, which will improve the bottom line of our local, state and federal governments.  Tell them raising wages will mean more revenue for Social Security, and better benefits for those workers when they retire.Tell them raising wages works.  It’ll build America up.This is how we rise, and it’s way past time for us to rise again, and we’ll bring with us all the workers, all the families, and all who believe in the American Dream!You’ve got a heck of a line-up for your conference, Elizabeth Warren and Nancy Pelosi, along with some of our other genuine champions.That’s great.We’re part of a powerful movement at a historic moment, and in your retirement you’re on the front lines.  When you go back home, you’ll be better prepared with what you gain here, to push our movement forward.And for that we all say, thank you.Our extreme right-wing political opponents and corporate CEOs will challenge us at every turn.  But nobody and nothing can match the breadth and scope of the American labor movement, when we unite with allies and partners, when we stand together with those who share our vision and our values.This is our day, our time, our rights, our voice, our power, our country, and we will do better. Together.So declare with me today that we’ll march for it.  We’ll fight for it.  We’ll organize for it and mobilize for it.  We’ll keep building and winning, winning a better future for us and for our kids, and their kids.  Together today.  Together tomorrow.  Together for as long as it takes to win a country that works for all workers!Thank you!  God bless you, and the work you do!

360,Trumka: Build America. Create Jobs. Do It Now! ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-build-america-create-jobs-do-it-now,5-11-2015,"Thank you for joining us.  I’m Rich Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO.Talk is cheap in Washington, D.C.  We hear a lot of noise about priorities, but we see very little action.  Instead, Congress lurches from self-inflicted crisis to self-inflicted crisis, engaging in tit-for-tat debates and wasting precious time with political posturing.  It just makes you wonder what their real priorities are.Well, let me give you an American priority, one shared by working people and business leaders everywhere.  I’m talking about big public investments in America’s infrastructure.  Roads. Bridges.  Sewers.  Pipelines.  Transit.  Waterways.  Ports.  Electrical grids.  Internet and phone lines.  Drinking water.Those investments benefit everybody.  Those investments create jobs.  Those investments build America.If you want to spend money to make money, build infrastructure, build bridges, expand ports and modernize railways.Good, safe roads and transit systems can get workers to work and back every day.  Companies can get manufactured goods to market.All of our infrastructure systems need attention, but the most immediate concern is the Highway and Transit Trust Fund.  Once again, it’s about to expire.  We don’t need another temporary extension.  It’s been extended 30 times in the last seven years.  That’s no way to do business.  We need a permanent funding source.  States have been forced to postpone and cancel necessary construction.  This is becoming another self-inflicted crisis.  I’m not talking about a pretend crisis.  One out of nine bridges in America is structurally deficient.  That’s from the American Society of Civil Engineers.  A bridge collapse is a real crisis.  Failing to pay for infrastructure is dangerous.  It’s irresponsible.  We can do better.America needs a reliable, long-term funding source now.  The Highway and Transit Trust Fund should be a top priority.  Not political jockeying.  Not trying to get the best soundbite.It’s so basic.  We’ve put forward funding sources.  We’ve explained how the trust fund strengthens our communities with good jobs and creates opportunities for economic growth.  The trust fund improves America’s quality of life and makes us competitive in this global age, and we all bear the cost of inaction.  Every year every single person in America spends almost 38 hours and almost $1,000 in wasted fuel while we idle in traffic.  Add that together.  It’s $120 billion a year, wasted.  It buys us nothing!  Raising the fuel tax would cost less, and we’d get something in return!Business and working people join together again today for the kick-off of Infrastructure Week to tell the White House and to tell Congress this simple message: Build America.  Create jobs.  Do it now!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
361,Trumka to Japanese Trade Union Confederation: Inequality is Unjust,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-japanese-trade-union-confederation-inequality-unjust,5-5-2015,"Thank you for your kind words of introduction.  It’s good to be in Japan.  I want to give special thanks to Brother Koga, the secretary-general of RENGO and to all the brothers and sisters of RENGO for your partnership with the AFL-CIO.Our national labor movements are cooperating more closely all the time, and we all acknowledge how important it is for us to continue working together to increase the strength of working people all over the world.This visit to Japan is part of that effort, so once again, I want to express my thanks to RENGO and Koga-san for hosting me.  The deep friendship between RENGO and the AFL-CIO is critical.  As labor leaders, we have a big job to do, all of us.  We need to reverse the world-wide trend of rising inequality.  To do so, we must build unity among all working people and assert that unity for shared prosperity and rising wages for all.As some of you may know, next year in the United States, we will be holding presidential elections.  Our election cycle has already started, and the campaigns will likely end up costing billions of dollars.  One major goal of the U.S. labor movement is to put the interests of and the issues faced by working people and our families front and center as the presidential campaigns unfold.  We have a full agenda, but it all comes back to one simple idea: Working people need wages to rise.Last week, I gave a speech on presidential politics in an effort to move the national political conversation back in line with the basic interests of working people, all of us, from the working poor to the middle class.In that speech, I explained how we will judge candidates for the presidency in 2016.  We’ll use a simple standard.  Either they stand behind policies to help working families regain our lost wages and grow our pay, or they don’t.  We’re not interested in those who say nice things but fail us when it counts.  We’re not interested in cautious half-measures.  We want to bargain collectively without apology.  We want public investment in the public good.  We want student debt relief. We want to tax Wall Street for America’s priorities.  We want equal pay for women.  We want solutions.Any candidate who wants to appeal to workers in the coming elections in America must put forth a bold and comprehensive Raising Wages agenda.  Candidates must be committed to investing in a prosperous future for all working people.  You see, it’s not just the working poor who are falling behind anymore.  It’s the middle class as well.  It’s everybody who counts on a paycheck to live.So like I said, last week we laid down a standard.  For working families in the United States, it is the standard.  We will use that standard both to judge candidates and policies and to organize and mobilize in the community, in the workplace and in politics.Whatever we do, wherever we live, all of us, want our work to lift us up.  We all want to build a better life for ourselves and our families.  In Japan and in the United States and indeed all over the world, we’re pushing for stronger national wages and against the growing use of temporary and part-time jobs as a business strategy to undermine unions and working people.It’s an uphill battle.  Since the 1980s, the growing political power of the wealthiest people in America has rewritten my country’s labor laws, trade laws, tax laws, monetary policies, fiscal policies and financial regulations, all to push wages down and to increase corporate profits, to put speculation over private investment and tax cuts over public investment. The results: Runaway inequality.  Unemployment.  Falling wages.  Rising economic insecurity, collapsing infrastructure.  Deteriorating national competitiveness.  All driven by gigantic imbalances in economic and political power.One simple comparison captures the whole story: since 1978, U.S. CEOs have increased their own pay by almost 1,000 percent.  In the same 37 years, the wages of 90% of us have gone down.  That is a violation of the American Promise.  And women are disproportionately impacted, earning only 78 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts with the same experience and education.Today, right-wing politicians and anti-union employers are trying to take the worst ideas from American politics and industrial relations and export them to places like Europe and Japan.Our collective voice, the voice of working people, is the best and strongest defense against this anti-worker agenda, both here and in the United States.  And I pledge to stand with you, so we can raise our voices together to lift all of us up.All of us stand at a crossroads. On one hand, for instance, in America, we see a tremendous and popular movement to raise wages.  On the other hand is a well-funded corporate campaign to drive wages down even further.Let me tell you about it.  It’s inspirational.Look at the Our Walmart campaign in the United States.  Our Walmart is a global campaign to improve working conditions for workers at Walmart stores.  You may know that Walmart is the largest private employer in the world.  Week after week, and month after month, a movement for fairness and good wages continues to grow at that massive retailer and at other big U.S. retailers like Target and TJMaxx.There’s more.  In a recent national day of action by fast food workers demanding $15 an hour, we saw incredible unity.  Adjunct college professors marched with firefighters and home health care workers and, yes, fast food workers.America wants to raise wages for all workers, full-time, part-time, temporary.  We are fighting for all workers.  We are working in many of the states to win paid sick days and family leave benefits.  In the United States, there is no national plan to protect workers who go on maternity leave, are sick or need to care for aging relatives.The raising wages movement in America is not coming just from organized labor.  We understand that to have real power we need to build partnerships with women, civil and human rights organizations, environmental groups.  It’s a true groundswell, a positive uprising with growing momentum.Yet working people in America also have terrible challenges.  One of our top priorities today is to prevent more destructive corporate-written trade laws.Don’t get me wrong.  We’re not against all trade and in fact, the AFL-CIO has supported trade agreements and trade benefit programs that we feel can positively impact workers.  We’re just against bad trade, and the model we see today in the Trans-Pacific Partnership is not a model that will lessen inequality and help workers.Right now, in the United States, we are debating a piece of legislation called Trade Promotion Authority or Fast Track.  We stand against using Fast Track trade promotion authority to pass big trade bills like the TPP, because it doesn’t allow for a healthy give-and-take.  Fast Trade authority only allows our Congress to conduct an up or down vote, without any amendments.I don’t have time to get into all the nuts-and-bolts of our issues with this trade deal, and I know many people in Japan have been following this issue especially with the visit by Prime Minister Abe to Washington D.C. last week.  But I will say this: We stand against using Fast Track because of our commitment to shared prosperity.  Fast Track will undermine working people and undermine the American democracy.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is too big to get just an up or down vote.  It would cover 40% of the world economy.  Its consequences are too great.  The margin for error is too small.  Too many parts of it give corporations special favors and put working people at the end of the line.At the AFL-CIO, we will continue to work in the U.S. and with our global allies for a better model of trade.  We recently released a joint statement with European unions on what we would like to see in this agreement so it represents a new model with high labor and environmental standards as well as other key issues.  I know here in Japan you are also looking at an agreement with Europe.  We need to make sure these agreements actually work for workers.That’s really important.  We cannot let trade laws pit the workers of Japan and the workers of the United States and the other countries around the Pacific Ocean against each other in a relentless race to the bottom.  We need to support each other in creating high-rode models in which our companies support strong rights for workers here in Japan and the U.S.The way I see it, we don’t really have much of a choice.  I, for one, will never accept fundamental inequality as simply a part of modern life.  It’s not right.  It’s unfair.  It’s unjust, and we can do something about it.Our work against bad trade policy in the United States is only part of a large, over-arching strategy in and beyond our labor movement.Let me tell you about some of our other campaigns, because we are attacking inequality in other ways, too.  We’re focusing on justice in our communities and indeed throughout our societies. We’re talking to partners and gaining new allies.  We’re growing bigger coalitions, because, you see, raising wages is one link that binds together social and economic justice.In the United States, the AFL-CIO is a major partner in nationwide campaigns to end mass incarceration and to win comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship.  In the United States, these campaigns are central to our work to raise wages.It’s the right thing to do—but these are also work issues.  Eleven million workers who are American in every way but on paper because they don’t have their official work documents are routinely denied fundamental workplace rights and decent wages because some bad employers call the immigration cops when workers try to organize.That happens, even in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol.  And it’s fundamentally wrong.  The United States is a nation of immigrants.  We were built by immigrants.  We remain an immigrant nation today, and I believe in the immigrant dream of coming to America to work hard and get ahead to build a better life, and my union values tell me to celebrate this dream.When it comes to mass incarceration, one in 15 African American men is in the U.S. prison system today, while fewer than one in 100 white men are in the system—even though black and white men commit crime at roughly the same rate.  It is no coincidence that the total population in the United States’ correctional system has exploded in the decades since the business of for-profit incarceration was born.  This is unjust and it’s tearing apart our communities.  We are criminalizing a huge population of black men, and the practice is suppressing wages because millions of people who have served their time remain locked out of the job market by employers who screen applicants for felony convictions.  Working people are affected on all sides of this issue, including police and corrections officers, whose jobs are made more dangerous by mandatory sentencing laws and prison overcrowding.Labor rights, social justice and economic justice cannot be separated, cannot be isolated.  When your rights are targeted, mine are in danger.  We’ve seen that again and again and again.  That’s why labor must lead the progressive fight.In the labor movement, we know how to stand together.  We know to call injustice out for what it is, and fight to make it right.  We know how to rally, when your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.And when we win, we all win.  That’s the beauty of a raising wages world.Brothers and sisters, the challenges of working people globally are legion.  We’ve got political opponents who want to take us out.  Employers who want to compete on lowering labor standards.  In the United States, we’ve got governors falling over themselves to sign right-to-work laws to make it harder for working people to bargain for a better life. As labor movements, our goal must be to do much more than service our members.  We must provide an alternative example—one in which our collective voices steadily work for the common good.Today, you and I are strengthening the coalition between your working people and those of the United States.  This is a partnership that must grow and deepen.  Wages here in Japan affect wages everywhere, and the reverse is also true.  The same can be said about workers’ rights here. The same can be said about environmental standards and civil and human rights.Coalitions can transform politics and the policies shaping our economies.  I’ve seen it happen.  It is hard work, but it’s the best way for working people to grow power.  When we stand together, the numbers are on our side.  Standing together is how we’ll build strong economies.  Raising wages works.  It works economically.  It works politically.  It’s the right thing to do, and it’ll work for every single one of us.We’re building at every level, in electoral politics and in workplace, in our communities and internationally.  We want to stand with you.  We want to organize alongside you in companies where we have shared interests.  We want collective bargaining in the United States to strengthen your pay and grow your opportunities here in Japan.  And we want the reverse to be true.I look forward to all the work we can accomplish together.  A stronger partnership between workers of Japan and the US.  I look forward, with you, to a raising wages world.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
362,"Trumka on 2016 Presidential Race: Our Standard is ""Raising Wages""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-2016-presidential-race-our-standard-raising-wages,4-28-2015,"Thank you, Liz [Shuler], for your words of introduction. Before I get into the main substance of my remarks, I want to acknowledge Workers Memorial Day. Today, we remember the 150 men and women who die every day from a workplace injury or occupational disease.Please join me in a moment of silence in their honor.[Moment of silence.]Thank you.  The arrival of spring in Washington has brought baseball—as well as the other D.C. obsession and America’s second-favorite pastime: presidential politics.The election is more than 18 months away, but already ideas are percolating and candidates are stepping forward to announce for the presidency.Working people are stepping forward, too.  We are not waiting for an invitation.  We have created an agenda for shared prosperity called Raising Wages. It will be our inspiration and our measuring stick throughout the presidential campaign.  Raising Wages is grounded in a fundamental idea—that we can become a high-wage society, a society in which the people who do the work share in the wealth we create.That idea faces a political landscape characterized by two powerful forces: one, there is an enormous need in America.  Our nation is struggling, and has been struggling for almost two generations.  Two, there is an equal amount of skepticism in America.  For decades, we have given politicians the benefit of the doubt.  Today, there is much more doubt than there is benefit. As the presidential campaigns begin, workers have a very clear question: Will candidates be and think and act big enough to seize this historic opportunity?Will they look past what Washington says can’t be done and do what America needs? Will they overcome our skepticism?  Will they present a vision that’s authentic, bold and unequivocal?  Will our candidates meet the moment?It is early, and although many candidates are already in the race, the field remains open.  And the labor movement's doors are open to any candidate who is serious about transforming our economy with high and rising wages.  We want to talk to candidates who will deliver and who we can trust to always be on the side of all working people.Over nearly two generations, national leaders have either taken steps that worsened inequality or fiddled around the edges, trying to raise wages in an economy fundamentally built to lower wages. President Obama has spent much of his presidency getting our nation out of a deep economic crisis.  Now we have an economy where GDP is up, and the stock market is up, but wages remain flat—and this has happened again and again since the 1970s.  Once again, America is emerging from an economic crisis—but those of us who count on paychecks are not.  And that's not an accident.  Workers are being held down on purpose.For almost two generations, our economic policies—the very structure of our economy—have been designed to push incomes down for the vast majority of working people.  This was planned. It’s not the accidental result of the wandering and clumsy hand of capitalism.Since the 1980s, the growing political power of the wealthiest among us has rewritten our labor laws, our trade laws, our tax laws, our monetary policies, our fiscal policies, our financial regulations, all to push wages down and to increase corporate profits, to put speculation over private investment and tax cuts over public investment.      The results: Runaway inequality.  Unemployment.  Falling wages.  Rising economic insecurity, collapsing infrastructure.  Deteriorating national competitiveness.  All driven by gigantic imbalances in economic and political power. One simple comparison captures the whole story: since 1978, CEOs have increased their own pay by almost 1,000 percent.  In the same 37 years, the wages of 90% of us have gone down.  That is a violation of the American Promise.  It’s not just the poor who are falling behind, it’s the middle class, too.And now, this story threatens to grow in scale, with Fast Track and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But all across the country, workers are leading a fierce and broad social movement to defeat Fast Track.  We are rebelling against corporate-written free trade agreements—and we are succeeding.  The TPP is the latest example of a long-term approach to trade that, starting with NAFTA, was designed to drive wages down, create special rights for corporations and export jobs.  The labor movement opposes Fast Track.  We expect those who seek to lead our nation forward to oppose Fast Track.  There is no middle ground, and the time for deliberations is drawing to a close.In the 2016 campaign, there will be no place to hide for those who aspire to lead America. The problems of income inequality and stagnant wages are so clear, so abundant, that only direct, sweeping action to change the rules will put our nation on a fresh path of progress.We are hungry for a path to a prosperous 21st century.  And America’s workers know that the first step on that path is Raising Wages.Yes, Raising Wages includes lifting national wages—but it’s far broader than that. We want earned sick leave and paid family leave.  We want full employment, fair overtime rules and fair scheduling so people don’t have to guess whether they’ll get enough hours to pay the rent.  We want student debt relief.  We want to tax Wall Street to pay for massive investments in infrastructure and education, so Wall Street serves Main Street, not the other way around.  And we want to be able to bargain collectively with our employers for good wages and benefits without fear of retaliation.We want to raise wages.  And that’s exactly what we’re doing, despite policies designed to hold us down. Working people, and the collective voice, are rising.  Look at the people who work at Walmart, McDonald’s and Target, and TJMaxx and Marshalls.  In those fights alone, a combined 2 million people have won raises in just the past few months.  It’s not enough, but it’s a start.  We are fighting in new ways with new ideas—and starting to win.We are swarming ballot boxes, city halls and state houses.  Initiatives to raise the minimum wage won last November in every state they were on the ballot.  Red State, Blue State, it didn’t matter, from Alaska to Illinois.  Cities across the country have been adopting universal earned sick leave.  San Francisco passed a retail workers bill of rights.  Seattle raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour.And working people are bargaining with employers like never before.  In 2015, more union members will bargain for new contracts than in any other year in American history.  Five million union members are negotiating this year for contracts with employers in every conceivable industry.  Together, through collective bargaining, we are asking for a raise.Five million workers sitting down with employers to bargain in a straightforward way, to make the case to raise wages.  That’s what the collective voice is about.  That’s what American democracy is about.Our whole country deserves that same conversation.Working people, together, are rising.  The question is, will our candidates listen?  Will they seize this opportunity?  I wonder, and so do the vast majority of working Americans.  The truth is we’re skeptical.Are we wrong to be skeptical?  I don’t think so.  A surging army of workers, activists and families are tired of taking “maybe” for an answer.  We’re tired of scared politicians who won’t stand up for what’s right.  Listen to this: About one-third—30%—of working class voters after the last election said they couldn’t see any significant difference between the two parties.Both parties, they said, side with the wealthy over working people.  Both parties are too close to big corporations.  Neither party cares deeply enough about creating jobs.  Neither party cares enough about raising wages or protecting Social Security or Medicare.Of the working class voters we surveyed, 80% of Democrats and Republicans, 80%, say both parties do far too much for Wall Street and not nearly enough to help average folks.That’s what America thinks.Are we wrong?  I don’t think so. Anyone who thinks it’s OK for women to get 78 cents on the dollar is willingly betraying the American Promise.  Anyone letting corporate America write our economic rules while expressing surprise at the outcome is willingly betraying the American Promise.That’s why we’re skeptical.  And our skepticism will only be overcome by an honest conversation about how we can all benefit from what we produce and expand the American Promise.  We want to make our case and get an authentic, meaningful response.  That’s what we want from employers, and that’s what we want from our presidential candidates.That’s why we at the AFL-CIO are creating Raising Wages Summits in each of the first four presidential primary states.  At these summits, beginning next month in Iowa, working people will make the case for a raising wages agenda.  Together, we will declare the standard by which presidential aspirations will be judged.And that brings me back to the opportunity in front of us, both for our country and for the men and women who might want to lead it.To candidates who have just discovered that there is an income inequality problem in America, we say “welcome.”  We encourage them to dig deeper, to understand and respond to the history, the intent and the impact of this problem.And we say to them, we appreciate your words of acknowledgment.  But, now what?  After almost two generations of intentional assault on our incomes, our families and our dignity, working people are not going to be satisfied with words of acknowledgment.  We want action.  We want big ideas, and we want structural change.  We want Raising Wages.That also means no candidate can be all things to all people and still meet this standard.  Standing with working people once in a while won’t work.  Candidates can’t hedge bets any longer. Workers have swallowed the politics of hedged bets for almost two generations.  We’ve waited for the scraps that remain after the pollsters shape the politics.Those days are over.  America doesn’t need relentlessly cautious half-measures.  Any candidate who wants to appeal to workers has to put forth a bold and comprehensive Raising Wages agenda.  They must be committed to investing in a prosperous future for America.  They must have an authentic voice and a commitment, from the candidate down through his or her economic team, to see this agenda through to completion.We have an agenda for shared prosperity, and we want the same from candidates.  They must address essential questions like these: How will you make sure the incomes of working people regain lost ground and grow?  How will you show us that corporations will no longer write America’s economic rules?  How will you establish public investment in America’s common goals as a priority over narrow special interests?  How will you make sure we all rise together with justice in our communities, dignity for immigrants and fairness for all, regardless of gender or sexuality, race, ethnicity or wealth?We call on all of America’s working men and women—Democrat and Republican, white collar, blue collar and no collar—to join us in supporting the candidate who can and will deliver on the American Promise.  That is the standard.  We will not settle for less.Thank you.

363,"Trumka Calls for ""Raising Wages World"" on International Labor Day",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-calls-raising-wages-world-international-labor-day,4-27-2015,"Thank you, Ambassador [Peter] Wittig, for inviting me here and for hosting this discussion about building shared prosperity. I’m honored to speak to all of you.But before I begin, I’d like us to pause in honor of May Day and Workers Memorial Day.  Please join me in a brief moment of silence for the working people worldwide who have lost their lives on the job in the past year.  [Moment of silence.] Thank you.  As we honor workers, it is a good time for us to be talking and thinking about the vision and values shared by all working people, here in America and around the world.Whatever we do, we all want our work to lift us up, wherever we live.  We all want to build a better life for ourselves and our families.  In Germany and in the United States and indeed all over the world, we’re pushing for stronger national wages, and against the growing use of temporary jobs as a business strategy to undermine unions and working people.Last week, I had the honor of spending time with Reiner Hoffman, president of the DGB, and he and I talked about the importance of strengthening our transatlantic partnership, and raising wages for working people.This idea of raising wages is growing in popularity.  I believe we are on the brink of an era unprecedented in modern life.  We’re seeing grassroots momentum growing all over this country and indeed all over the world.  Working people want a share of the wealth we create, and we’re ready to stand together to demand it.Just look at the Our Walmart campaign here in the United States.  Week after week, and month after month, a movement for fairness and good wages continues to grow at that massive retailer, and at others like Target and TJMaxx.  These are big and growing movements.  In the recent national day of action by fast food workers in Ohio demanding $15 an hour, for instance, we saw adjunct professors marching next to firefighters and home health care workers and, yes, fast food workers.  That’s inspirational.What I’m seeing is a positive movement with growing momentum.  When working people make gains, it lifts up our entire economy.  Working people are stepping forward as leaders, not just for themselves but for our nation.  It makes me think of the way workers have been such important partners in the German economy and in society.  I’m thinking of the German labor-management model of co-determination and the idea that both workers and corporations take part in a basic social contract to lift up the whole country.  That idea, in which government, workers and business all come together, offers opportunities and challenges to us here in the United States, and to workers and governments around the world.This model has many aspects, from the quality of German apprenticeships, to the specific approaches of companies like Volkswagen that are worth study by us in the United States.In the American labor movement, we’re ready to embrace any idea that works.  We’ll advocate for the policies that promote shared prosperity, and we’ll fight the things that will make it worse. We’re doing it on both the proposed trade agreement between Europe and the United States, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  We stand against using Fast Track trade promotion authority here in America to pass these big trade bills.I don’t have time to get into the nuts-and-bolts of our issues with these trade deals, but I will say this: We stand against using Fast Track because of our commitment to shared prosperity.  Fast Track will undermine us and undermine our democracy.  These bills are too big.  The consequences are too great.  The margin for error is too small.  And, frankly, today we’re all completely in the dark about them.An open process will give us a chance to raise wages.  Raising wages is why we’re doing everything we do.You see, our work against bad trade policy in the United States is only part of a large, over-arching strategy in and beyond our labor movement: We want to raise wages for all working people, because so much of what’s wrong in our economy stems from the disconnect between pay and productivity.In the United States, wages have been stagnant for over a decade.  In fact, between 1997 and 2012, the income of those in the bottom 90% fell by $3,000 while that of the top 1% almost doubled.  This happened even as our productivity rose.  This is not just a problem for our individual families.  Economists agree that this hurts the entire American economy, and by extension it affects the world.The U.S. labor movement is working to enact minimum wage hikes, fair overtime rules, earned sick leave and other policy initiatives to raise wages in America.  At the city and state level, our labor organizations have partnered with community allies to make all manner of positive change. In Los Angeles we’ve partnered with environmentalists, business groups and a dozen others to win investments in massive infrastructure projects that create good jobs and a more sustainable environment.  In Seattle, we helped lead a coalition to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. San Francisco has a new Retail Workers Bill of Rights.  Organizations like Jobs With Justice have been pivotal from coast to coast and across the country.  They’ve won local rules against wage theft and have made progress on other important issues.And yet we know from experience the single best way for working people to get and keep a raise is by asking for one with a collective voice.  That’s why it’s important for every worker to be able to form a union on the job.The International Monetary Fund, hardly a leftist group, and the OECD recently released studies tying rising inequality to the attacks on collective bargaining rights.This year, in the United States, 5 million union workers are bargaining contracts.  It’s the biggest year for bargaining in recent American history, and we’re going to raise wages.We’re standing together with union workers, nonunion and never-heard-of-union.  In just the first few months of the year, we have supported the struggle of 2 million non-union workers to win raises from retailers like Target, Walmart and others.  These raises aren’t enough, but they’re a start.This vision of raising wages can help us grow bigger coalitions, because, you see, raising wages is one link that binds social and economic justice.Labor rights, social justice and economic justice cannot be separated, cannot be isolated.  When your rights are targeted, mine are in danger.  We’ve seen that again and again and again.  That’s why labor must lead the progressive fight.We know how to stand together.  We know to call injustice out for what it is, and fight to make it right.  We know how to rally, when your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.And when we win, we all win.  That’s the beauty of a raising wages world.Brothers and sisters, trade has linked our economies more closely than they’ve ever been before. Wages here affect wages everywhere, and the reverse is also true.  The same can be said about workers’ rights here.  The same can be said about environmental standards and civil and human rights.  Quite frankly, the interests we have as working people span all the things that could divide us, and as institutions, our unions do, too.  Nothing and nobody can match the breadth and scope of labor unions, when we unite with allies and partners who share our vision and our values.The challenges of working people are legion.  We’ve got political opponents who want to take us out.  In the United States, we’ve got governors falling over themselves to sign right-to-work laws to make it harder for working people to bargain for a better life.  All over the world, politicians are itching to take the worst ideas from the United States and use them on your workers.  We want to provide an alternative example—one in which collective voices work for the common good.We know it works.  Coalitions can transform politics in the United States and everywhere.  I’ve seen it happen.  I’ve seen alliances elect true progressives in places as different as Los Angeles and Nebraska.Coalition work is hard, but it’s the best way for working people to grow power.  When we stand together, the numbers are on our side.  Standing together is how we’ll build a strong economy.  Raising wages works.  It works economically.  It works politically.  It’s the right thing to do, and it’ll work for every single one of us, and all of you, for our whole society.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
364,"Trumka to Canadian Labor Movement: ""It’s up to us to make a change.""  ",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-canadian-labor-movement-its-us-make-change,3-27-2015,"Thank you, Sister Barb [Byers], for your kind introduction.  It’s good to be back in Canada.  I don’t get here enough, but I’m always happy when I do.  Last August, I was coming this direction, but I overshot Canada a little bit and ended up in Alaska.  Well, I got it right this time. Once again, thanks for having me.Before I begin, I want to thank the Broadbent Institute and your chairman, Ed Broadbent, for inviting me to this important discussion about why labor must lead the progressive fight.  I’m excited about this subject, because I believe it will lead our labor unions and our coalition of allies toward a new era of broadly shared prosperity.I think the work your unions are doing here in Canada, and your political and community organizing are critical.  I’ve learned something about your growing worker centers and the way you’re addressing issues specific to women, among your First Nations and with young workers.Earlier this month, the AFL-CIO held our third Next Up Young Workers Summit.  It was in Chicago, and it was the best one yet, and I am so glad to learn of the growing power of young workers in Canada.  Keep up the good work!It is so important for us to return to the core ideals of unionism.  Our unions lift up working people, not just some, but all.  And the more a group of workers is down, the more a group is hurting, the harder we have to fight and organize and advocate, because we are all, truly, connected.Now I’d like to say a few words about the big new trade agreements our countries are proposing.Today everybody knows how these so-called free trade agreements have hollowed out our national economies, and yet for some reason some people still believe these new deals involving our nations have merit. I’m not against trade deals.  Don’t get me wrong.  I’m just against bad trade deals.  But I am optimistic that our labor movements can work together to end a provision that’s on the table in both countries called ISDS, which stands for Investor-State Dispute Settlement.  The ISDS is a secret tribunal where investors can challenge and override laws and regulations of democratically elected governments—and the provision threatens our environment, food safety, labor rights, human rights and more.Nobody should get a secret tribunal.  Working people don’t.  We have a clunky, slow and ineffective process in Colombia, where 73 trade unionists were murdered in the three years after the Labor Action Plan.  This is a tragedy.  It’s terrible, and anyone with a lick of common sense can tell you that not only are these killings a human rights catastrophe, they are driving down wages and workplace standards in Colombia—and in every country that trades with Colombia.And that’s in part why it’s so important to be standing in solidarity with the Canadian labor movement and your progressive community to demand that ISDS be taken out of our proposed deals and out of CETA.  It’s a bad provision that places the value of an investor’s dollar over the lives of working people.  It’s offensive.  It’s wrong.  And we stand against it.Our work against bad trade policy in the United States, and our collaboration with you here, are part of a large, over-arching strategy in our labor movement to raise wages.  Ending these bad trade deals will help us set the stage to raise wages.  And we want to raise wages for all working people, because so much of what’s wrong in our economy stems from the disconnect between pay and productivity.In the United States, wages have been stagnant for over a decade.  In fact, between 1997 and 2012, the income of those in the bottom 90% fell by $3,000 while that of the top 1% almost doubled.  This happened even as our productivity rose.  This is not just a problem for our individual families.  Economists everywhere agree that flat wages hurt our economies and depress demand.The U.S. labor movement is working to enact minimum wage hikes, fair overtime rules, earned sick leave and other policy initiatives to raise wages in America.  At the city and state level, our labor organizations have partnered with community allies to make all manner of positive change. In Los Angeles we’ve partnered with environmentalists, business groups and a dozen others to win investments in massive infrastructure projects that create good jobs and a more sustainable environment.  In Seattle, we helped lead a coalition to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. San Francisco has a new Retail Workers Bill of Rights.  Organizations like Jobs With Justice have been pivotal from coast to coast and across the country.  They’ve won local rules against wage theft and have made progress on other important issues.These local alliances have transformed politics, too, by electing true progressives in places as different as Los Angeles and Nebraska, and too many other places for me to name.On a national level, our unions have partnered with groups of workers at Walmart and fast food restaurants to fight for better pay and working conditions.  Those workers have started to win, and it feels good.  The strength and courage of those workers is one of the most exciting things in the United States, and we’re proud to stand with them.And yet we know from experience the single best way for working people to get and keep a raise is by asking for one with a collective voice.  That’s why it’s important for every worker to be able to form a union on the job.The International Monetary Fund, hardly a leftist group, and the OECD recently released studies tying rising inequality to the attacks on collective bargaining rights.It’s up to us to make a change.  This vision of raising wages, and the broader idea of the dignity and decency that raising wages represents, can unite a broad range of organizations.It’ll help us grow a bigger coalition, because, you see, raising wages is one link that binds social and economic justice.Our campaigns to end mass incarceration and to win comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship, for example, are central to our work to raise wages.It’s the right thing to do—but these are also work issues.  Eleven million workers who are American in every way but on paper are easily denied fundamental workplace rights and decent wages because unscrupulous employers call the immigration cops when workers try to organize. That happens, even in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol.  And it’s fundamentally wrong.  The United States is a nation of immigrants.  We were built by immigrants.  We remain an immigrant nation today, and I believe in the immigrant dream of coming to America to work hard and get ahead to build a better life, and my union values tell me to celebrate this dream.When it comes to mass incarceration, one in 15 black men is in the U.S. prison system today, while fewer than one in 100 white men are in the system—even though black and white men commit crime at roughly the same rate.  This is unjust and it’s tearing apart our communities.  We are criminalizing a huge population of black men, and the practice is suppressing wages because millions of people who have served their time remain locked out of the job market by employers who screen applicants for felony convictions.  Working people are affected on all sides of this issue, including police and corrections officers, whose jobs are made more dangerous by mandatory sentencing laws and prison overcrowding.Labor rights, social justice and economic justice cannot be separated, cannot be isolated.  When your rights are targeted, mine are in danger.  We’ve seen that again and again and again.  That’s why labor must lead the progressive fight.We know how to stand together.  We know to call injustice out for what it is, and fight to make it right.  We know how to rally, when your picket line is my picket line and my picket line is your picket line.And when we win, we all win.  That’s the beauty of a raising wages world.And let me tell you, we’re gonna win.  We’re fighting to win.  This year, in the United States, 5 million union workers are bargaining contracts.  It’s the biggest year for bargaining in recent American history, and we’re going to raise wages.We’re standing together with union workers, nonunion and never-heard-of-union.  We’re standing together, and we’re winning.  In one day last month—one 24-hour period—we saw Communications Workers and Electrical Workers in New England win raises.  We saw Communications Workers in Brooklyn win a first contract, with strong wage increases.  And we saw 500,000 workers win raises from Walmart!  A dozen other retailers have raised wages.  The latest one was Target.About those wins, I like to say if some is good, more is better.  We want more.  We want better. We want raising wages.Brothers and sisters, if you take away one thing from my talk today, I hope it’s this:  The interests we have as working people span all the things that could divide us, and as institutions, our unions do, too.  Nothing and nobody can match the breadth and scope of labor unions, when we unite with allies and partners who share our vision and our values.The challenges of working people are legion.  We’ve got political opponents who want to take us out.  In the United States, we’ve got governors falling over themselves to sign right-to-work laws to make it harder for working people to bargain for a better life.  Here in Canada, you’ve got politicians who are itching to take the worst policies from the United States and use them on you. I know you are fighting against bad legislation, C-377 and C-525, two bills that would make it harder for unions to organize and bargain.  You’ve got to beat back those bills from the Conservative government.  The corporate rightwing doesn’t get it, they’re stuck in the past.  We’re the future.Sisters and brothers, all of this is why I say now is a great time to be a trade unionist.  We are engaged in the struggle of our time!  Coalition work is hard, but it’s the best way to grow because when we stand together, the numbers are on our side.  Standing together is how we’ll build a strong economy.  Raising wages works.  It works economically.  It works politically.  It’s the right thing to do, and it’ll work for every single one of us, and all of you, for our whole society.This is our day.  This is our time.  Our rights, our voice, our power.  Canada needs you.  We’ll stand together.  We’ll win together.  We can do better.  We will do better.  We’ll march for it, sisters and brothers.  We’ll fight for it.  We’ll keep building, and winning, together!Thank you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka

It’s great to be here with all of you.I appreciate your introduction, Erica. I know about your work on the earned sick leave campaign here in Chicago and how that experience deepened your understanding of unionism, how you’ve said we must raise our voices for those silenced by circumstance and abusive bosses. That’s great. I want to thank you for getting involved. You are making a difference. Brothers and sisters: Your activism is compelling. Your politics are exactly right. Your energy is one of the most powerful things in this world. And for those reasons and more, I am honored to speak with you, honored and excited.
This Young Worker Summit is critical today. America is begging for change on a grand scale, the kind of change that has always been led by young people. Back in the 1930s, when unionism lifted up a nation and built the biggest middle class the world has ever known, young people led the fight.In the 1950s and 1960s, when the Civil Rights Movement ended legal segregation in America and brought our nation closer to true equality than we’d ever been before, young people were at the vanguard of the struggle.In the LGBTQ rights movement and the movement for gender equality, and in the struggle for immigrant rights and for relief for the DREAMers, and in the fights for public workers in Wisconsin and Ohio, in the political victories that elected America’s first African American as president, and in the protests for justice in Ferguson and all across this country, young people have led and are leading the organizing and the marching and the mobilizing.That’s important. Today, the circumstances of our nation call us to do all of those things together, to build a powerful middle class of working people, without leaving anyone behind, or disenfranchised.You have the power to make the change. That power, that ability to turn big dreams into action, America needs that today. America needs you. Our communities need you. We need young leaders fueled by a passion for justice. So I’m glad you’re all here at the third Next Up Young Worker Summit. I was looking over the list of attendees, and it’s amazing how many organizations are represented. You’re from all across the progressive spectrum—from unions and community organizations, student groups, policy organizations and more. Your agendas are ambitious and broad. But all of us are part of one movement for social and economic justice, one movement for dignity, one movement for a better future and an economy that works for regular people. 
In years past, people thought there were deep distinctions between white-collar and blue-collar working people, between those who work in office buildings and who clean office buildings. And yet while some earn more relative to others, falling wages and the wreckage of the American middle class have exposed the weakness of those divisions. In fact, last year, pay for workers with graduate degrees actually fell faster than it fell for those with college degrees, and both fell faster than pay for workers with high school diplomas.Today the only distinction that matters is between people who work for a living, and the few whose money works for them. The gulf between us is wide, and getting wider. Last year, a record 290 people became new billionaires, bringing the total number of billionaires worldwide to almost 2,000, with a total wealth of $7 trillion, up from $6 trillion last year. This is what it means: The world economy is producing more and more wealth, which is being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. 
This year in America, our gross domestic product grew to its highest value ever. We’re living in the richest country in the world, at its richest time in history. There’s no good reason for so many working people to suffer, or for our young people to be saddled with college debt, or our communities to lack decent jobs. No good reason at all. But there are plenty of bad ones.You see, our economy may be broken, but it can be fixed. Our economy is not like the weather. It doesn’t just happen to us. We can improve it. One important tool we have to change it is called Common Sense Economics. It’s an education program to teach regular working people how and why the economy works the way it does, and how we can fix it to make it work better. Our goal every year is to empower more and more people with the knowledge they need to make educated decisions about their choices on Election Day. Not long ago, I spoke to the Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives and to Progressive Congress. I told them it’s time for America’s leaders to step up, to be champions for working people, to stand for a progressive agenda, and to raise wages. Here’s how I described our legislative priorities. I told them it’s time for America to lay out a plan to enact laws and policies at every level to improve the standard of living of working people and working families. I’m talking about higher wages, expanded overtime pay, fair work schedules, paid sick leave—these and other changes to produce real progress.I asked them to change laws so that Wall Street no longer writes the economic rules. CEOs have been calling the shots for too long, offshoring jobs, corporate trade deals, risky investment schemes, attacks on unions and working people. You know, it’s kind of amazing, in America today, you can join just about any organization you want, any political party or any club or association, but if you try to form a union you face harassment, intimidation and worse. No more. That has to change. We’ve got to fight for new laws to make sure we don’t surrender the Bill of Rights when we start a job. We want new economic rules to restore balance, to make sure the wealthiest pay their fair share and to provide tough checks-and-balances throughout the economy. We want full employment. We want world-class infrastructure and a quality public education for every child. We want America to work for Main Street. We want jobs, business and government to work for working people again, with the costs shared equally by all of us. Raising wages means better lives and opportunity for all. It means addressing racial injustice and economic exclusion. Justice at work will advance justice in our communities, which will lay the groundwork to continue to raise wages.Collectively, these elements will build the final, critical element: political accountability. A strong raising wages agenda will be the voice of working people, our common voice, and, when unified, it will establish a standard of accountability that no political leader can evade.
But the power of working people has never come from politicians. We’re not looking for saviors, but for partners. We’ve got to lead the way ourselves. We’re doing it already. I know this isn’t news to some of you. But I’ve got to say I’m so proud of this fact: In one 24-hour period last month, Walmart workers won raises for 500,000 workers. In that same day, CWA and IBEW workers at Fairpoint in New England won a long battle for pay and benefits, and CWA workers at Cablevision in Brooklyn won a first contract! This year, 5 million workers in America are sitting down at the bargaining table to demand raising wages, safe jobs, good benefits and a better future. The world has two thousand billionaires? That’s nothing. Just the other day, almost 10,000 Steelworkers walked picket lines in a strike for safety. 
The billionaires may have the pocketbooks, but the numbers are on our side, and when we stand together, we’ve got the power, brothers and sisters. We’ve got the power! 
But that’s why our fight is the fight! The billionaires stand in our way. The right-wing stands in our way. Wall Street stands in our way, because they like the way things are. But I won’t complain about their dirty tactics. I’ll fight against them. The legislative attacks are coming thick and fast at the city, state and federal levels, and won’t they let up soon, but they’re stuck in the past. You’re the future. We need leaders like you. Who better? You’re the vanguard. You’ve shown us that you can find new ways forward. That’s what we need.Sisters and brothers, all of this is why I say now is a great time to be an activist in America. You are engaged in the struggle of our time! It’s hard. Yes. There are hurdles. Absolutely. The way forward is uncertain. You’re damn right. But you’re not afraid. You’re not going to be stopped.You see, raising wages works. That’s how to build a sustainable economy. It works economically. It works politically. It’s the right thing to do, and it’ll work for every single one of us, and all of you, for your entire generation and for our whole society.America needs justice. We’re ready to win it. You’re going to do it! You’re going to lift America up, and I’m blessed to be a part of it. This is your day. This is your time. Your rights, your voice, your power. America needs you. We’ll stand together. We’ll win together. We can do better. We will do better. We’ll march for it, sisters and brothers. We’ll fight for it. Start shouting. Let me hear you. Raise your voice and shout. Stand tall. Let it out! We’ll keep building, and winning, together! Keep fighting! Keep marching! Thank you!

366,Trumka Makes Case for New Direction on Trade,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-makes-case-new-direction-trade,3-18-2015,"Thank you, Adam, for your kind words, and I’d like to thank you and the Peterson Institute for inviting me to speak today. It’s good to be here. We spend a lot of time talking about trade, all of us. If you read the newspapers, it doesn’t take long to pick up the battle lines, the main theories and talking points. But at the end of the day, the partisan battles are just so much noise. For me, it’s all got to come back to one simple question: Is our trade policy working for America’s workers and for our nation as a whole?The simple answer is no. It isn’t. I don’t think anyone can credibly argue that America’s trade policies are working for American workers, for our friends from the neighborhood, for our kids or our home towns.And nor do I think the macroeconomic numbers support an argument that our current trade policy is working—whether you look at our chronic current account deficits, our net international debt position, or the broader labor market data on wage stagnation and growing inequality.So I say again—I simply don’t believe that argument can credibly be made.Jeb Bush, Florida’s former governor and now a presidential hopeful, recently said economic immobility and America’s struggling middle class are the defining issues of our time. Trade policy as it has been pursued since NAFTA, and as it is currently conceived in fast track and existing drafts of the TPP, is a significant contributor to those problems.We all heard President Obama in his most recent State of the Union when he said we must make sure everybody in our country has the tools to succeed. Pope Francis has made it his global mission to see that humanity is served by wealth, not ruled by it.Those goals should be shared by all of us when we talk about the next big steps in our global economy. I spend a lot of time talking to working people, the people who elected me and pay my salary—and the vast majority of them are far from Wall Street and Washington, D.C. These are people who have seen jobs go away, and the numbers on pay stubs remain stubbornly flat or even fall.Trade needs to work for all of us, every one of us, and that’s why we need a real debate in America about what we are trying to do when we make trade deals. Because the right answer can never be the sole purview of corporate America.The question we should start with is: How can our trade deals help us reach our shared goals?For more than 20 years, we have looked at trade through the very narrow lens of corporate interests. In truth, our trade deals were not really trade deals—they were investment deals. Their goal was not to promote America’s exports—it was to make it easier for global corporations to move capital offshore and ship goods back to America. The logical outcome was trade deficits and falling wages—and that’s exactly what we got.Now it’s time to adopt a broader lens that prompts a national conversation, rather than one that pushes trade as a corporate entitlement.You see, our trade deals must to do more than increase next-quarter returns on Wall Street. Our trade agreements should advance an economy that creates good jobs in America, and that enables regular working people to succeed by working hard to get ahead.The American labor movement has long said, loud and clear, that good trade agreements must improve wages and working conditions for workers around the globe, not just here in the United States. We have insisted, and will continue to insist, that has to be the yardstick we use to measure trade deals.We live, shop, work, and play in a globalized economy. That’s the way the world is. Yet that doesn’t mean working people are destined to suffer. Our trade agreements should advance the United States’ interests, and at the same time contribute to the overall development of the world’s economy and rising living standards for all.I’m asking you to visualize how trade policy can shape economic activity throughout global supply chains differently than it does today – not by greasing the skids for a global race to the bottom, but by incentivizing and rewarding innovation and creating good jobs. That’s how we can begin to shape the competitive strategies we want to encourage here in the United States and among our trading partners. That is how trade policy can help to balance the world economy and stabilize global financial markets. And that is how we lay the groundwork for working people to earn a fair share of the value we create, rather than simply lining the pockets of a tiny global elite while setting our financial system up for future crises.Today, as we discuss Fast Track, as well as the Trans-Pacific Partnership—we should focus on the issues of what is our national interest, and how can our trade policies advance it? I’ll spell out my positions on these two important questions, and in doing so I’ll make the case against passing Fast Track for TPP.First, the goal of our trade policies should be for the United States and the people who live here to have a fair chance to compete for investment and jobs in the world economy. Our goal should be a world economy that is structured around a virtuous cycle of broad-based rising incomes and rising living standards, rather than a vicious cycle of falling incomes and financial instability.Some of what I’m going to say is pointed, because, you see, working people have been pretty badly burned by existing trade deals.One basic problem is that much of the trade debate is actually a debate about whether we should debate trade policy—or just accept what we are handed by unaccountable elites. That’s plain wrong. Every single thing in our trade deals should be openly discussed and subject to public oversight and the full legislative process. There should be no question about that. Fast track is wrong and undemocratic, it’s a rotten process, and the American labor movement intends to kill it.If the American people understood all the devices in these deals that can be used to fight policies to make our food and workplaces safe, keep our air and water clean, and even just provide simple labels for consumers, they would be up in arms.I am one-hundred percent confident that the average person doesn’t want American trade law to give global corporations the most favorable possible investment terms while threatening our own democratic decision-making institutions and feeding global economic imbalances. I don’t think that’ll sell.We in the labor movement are not buying. “Democracy” should be the way we decide. People should not be made to accept more trade policies negotiated in secret by corporate interests that destroy jobs, exert downward pressure on American living standards, cause us to run accelerating current account deficits, place us in a vulnerable financial position, and contribute to the imbalances that led to the economic crisis that began in 2007. That’s how it’s been done for the last thirty years. The evidence is on the table and the verdict is clear. Trade policy has not worked for working people nor for our country as a whole and it’s time to change and move forward.Washington’s old corporate approach to trade policy is directly contrary to our overall national policy objectives, especially in areas of profound strategic importance to the United States, such as Central and South America and East Asia. This is because our trade policy has been designed to suppress wage growth in these economies and to stunt the development of governments capable of regulating their own economies and labor markets in their own national interest.So where does TPP stand in my estimation? It’s hard to say because nobody I know has seen the whole thing. That’s problematic in itself. But what I am aware of tells me this: It simply isn’t a high-standards agreement in relation either to TPP member countries or to China. And it is especially poorly conceived regarding key areas that will have strategic importance to the United States in a multi-polar 21st century.Let me break that down:The public portions of TPP include no meaningful language addressing currency manipulation, and no language addressing how member countries commit to reducing carbon emissions. In the critical area of labor rights, there is no reason to believe TPP’s labor rights provisions will ensure that workers in all 12 TPP countries will be able to organize and bargain for a fair share of the wealth they produce. The labor framework of prior trade agreements has been wholly ineffective at dealing with labor rights violations in small countries like Guatemala and Honduras. And, while the “May 10” agreement between President Bush and House Democrats was a significant step forward, even this advance has been unable to address the serious labor rights violations in Colombia, even in the context of a U.S. administration committed to labor rights enforcement.According to press accounts and USTR statements, one thing TPP does include is Investor-State Dispute Settlement. ISDS is just a fancy way to give corporations a special legal system that circumvents democratically accountable laws and courts.ISDS allows corporations to directly challenge almost any law or regulation based on ill-defined concepts such as “fair and equitable treatment.” In contrast, all provisions for enforcing labor rights in TPP require action by member governments—neither workers nor unions can enforce the labor rights provisions on their own even by suing in national courts.I’m not just talking theory here. In the first three years of the Labor Action Plan in Colombia, 73 trade unionists were murdered for trying to organize workers. These are men and women just like you and me who were killed for trying to exercise their rights under the law and speak in a collective voice. That’s terrible, and yet these trade deals have been completely ineffective in addressing this injustice. And the U.S. government has taken no official “trade” action in response. Anyone with a lick of common sense can tell you that not only are these killings a human rights catastrophe, they are driving down wages and workplace standards in Colombia—and in every country that trades with Colombia.But here’s the thing: unlike the clunky labor provisions, which require workers to wait for government action, these ISDS provisions can be used immediately by multinational firms to challenge efforts by TPP member countries to develop a modern regulatory state in key areas. ISDS tilts the playing field away from democracy, from workers and consumers, and toward big business and multinational investors.Now, sometimes we are told that TPP’s key objective is to allow U.S. firms to keep control of global supply chains. We’re told that will benefit us here in America.Forgive me if I pour a little cold water on those claims. No one has been able to explain how an agreement that seems focused on helping U.S. companies use their control over supply chains to move work to low-wage countries will help the United States or the people who live and work here. Frankly, after what happened with NAFTA, and China PNTR, and the Korea Trade Agreement, I don’t understand how anyone can make these arguments with a straight face.The TPP as described by USTR just isn’t consistent with the promises being made about how it will solve our problems with China. If anything, TPP gives China improved access to our market (via weak rules of origin), undermines existing understandings with China in the area of carbon emissions, and paves the way for China to enjoy the full benefits of TPP without addressing its use of currency policies to subsidize its exports.Quite frankly, TPP would be a step backward. But it is not too late to address these problems.For example, ISDS could be deleted from the trade deal. Scratch. It’s gone. Most everybody outside the United States would be delighted to see it go, so happy in fact that they might agree to strong language on currency manipulation. Making those two changes would also be popular here in America – on both sides of the aisle. And while the negotiators are at it, they could fix the holes that have allowed the Honduras labor rights case to languish for three years and the Guatemala case for six. Fix the weak rules of origin that China will exploit to its benefit. Add in provisions to address climate change and rebalance the pro-Wall Street tilt in the financial services, procurement, and food safety chapters. Then we can talk about it being a step forward instead of back.Don’t let anyone tell you the labor movement is opposed to trade agreements. The labor movement is opposed to bad trade agreements.Bad provisions like ISDS continue to have life only because they remain largely unknown, hidden in the dark. In the sunlight, they’ll vanish. I’m sure of it. That’s why Congress should reject Fast Track. How many more ugly, unpopular, undemocratic provisions will be locked in by fast track? I don’t know. None of us do. That’s why Fast Track is so destructive.But what if Fast Track is rejected? What should be the nuts-and-bolts of a new trade deal? Our trade policy should have the explicit goal of eliminating our trade deficit and restoring the U.S. to balanced trade. Our greatest priority in trade negotiations should be to create a level playing field for the people who live in America to compete, not to create special deals for corporations that happen to be incorporated here.And in tandem with that principle, our government should provide help to companies based on whether they are creating good jobs in the United States, not whether they are incorporated in the United States. That should be the test for import-export financing, for tax policy and, most of all, for entrée to the discussions about framing our trade policy.Special legislative procedures like Fast Track should be used only when Congress has complete confidence that our government is pursuing the right policies.After this country’s experience with corporate-dominated trade policies—the millions of lost jobs, the massive structural trade deficits, decades of falling wages—neither Congress nor the American people have that kind of confidence in those who lead our trade policy. It’s time to change the paradigm.Let’s move forward as a nation. We have an agenda in the American labor movement--Raising Wages. We’re working on it at every level and in every corner of the country. We support fast food workers in the Fight for $15 an hour. We support Walmart workers, who recently fought for and won a raise—not enough of a raise but Walmart workers showed that the way to raise wages is to stand up and fight. And this year, 5 million union members are negotiating for higher wages, better benefits and safer working conditions.The wages of working people have basically not gone up a dime since 1997 (when inflation is taken into account). Since then, all of the gains from increased productivity, not some, not most, but all, have gone to the people who need it least.We know that our trade policy is a critical part of the structure of our economy—a structure that either is about raising wages or pushing wages down. We need a trade policy that supports raising wages, just like we need to invest in 21st century infrastructure and education and a skilled work force, to raise the minimum wage, to reform our labor laws, to ensure our tax policies are consistent with supporting good jobs and raising wages, and to deliver full employment.by ensuring that our macroeconomic policy doesn’t cut off recovery before it happens.We know that raising wages will be good for our families, for local businesses and our communities, and for America as a whole. We’re going to lay the groundwork for raising wages by rejecting Fast Track and, if it isn’t fixed, by rejecting the TPP. And then we will pursue a productive and balanced trade deal in the Pacific. We know we can only accomplish this by welcoming and engaging in a vigorous and open debate over trade policy.That, my friends, is how we’ll find the elusive win-win trade agreement.

367,Trumka Brings Labor's Message to House Democratic Caucus,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-brings-labors-message-house-democratic-caucus,1-28-2015,"Thank you, Debbie [Dingell], for inviting me to speak with all of you.  I’m glad for the opportunity.  I’m always happy to be in the same room as my good friend Nancy Pelosi, as well as Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn, and so many others. Thank you.I don’t call you my friends lightly.  We have relationships based on shared values and good work accomplished together over years, decades, generations, even.  The folks in this room, and members of your party who are not with us today, have accomplished incredible things for the American people.  Raising the minimum wage again and again over the years.  Funding our nation’s infrastructure and our children’s schools.  Enacting the Family Medical Leave Act.  And now you’re championing Chris Van Hollen’s proposal to re-balance taxes to put more money in the pockets of the middle-class with the Financial Transaction Tax.  We call it the Wall Street speculation tax, an idea whose time has come.  For all you have done, and for all we will do together, thank you!Yet our accomplishments cannot be summed up with any list, no matter how long, because our work has always been an expression of our shared values, our belief that everybody deserves dignity and a shot at a decent life, that working people should share in the wealth we create. That’s our vision.  It must also be the basis for a coherent economic message built on real plans. We at the AFL-CIO laid out just such a vision in a report called ‘Prosperity Economics,’ written for the AFL-CIO by Yale Professor Jacob Hacker, and we’re promoting those same ideas with our Common Sense Economics program being rolled out to union members and allies across America this year.  I want to see a similar message from each and every one of you.It’s time.  You see, we’re all coming off a tough year politically. We’ve seen friends, good friends, lose office and people who aren’t friendly replace them.  And remember: This last year has been tough for everyone in America who counts on a paycheck to pay the bills.  We polled swing-state voters on Election Day—54% said their families’ income had fallen in real terms.  Only 8% said it went up.  Income for everyone else was flat.  As I see it, these numbers tell you everything you need to know about the 2014 Election, and why so many people are losing faith in politics.This year, 2015, offers us a chance to answer skepticism with real vision, a strong and broad economic plan.  We need that now—voters need that now—before the 2016 elections.Frankly, Democratic leaders have a problem, a big problem.  Our polling shows that a lot of union voters—about one-third—don’t see much of a difference between the two parties on issue after issue after issue.  They tell us both parties side with the wealthy over working people and are too close to big corporations.  And neither party, they say, cares deeply enough about creating jobs, or raising wages, or even protecting Social Security or Medicare, for that matter.In fact, 80% of Democratic and Republican union members alike say politicians of both parties do far too much to support Wall Street’s financial interests, and not nearly enough to help average folks.That’s what people think.  It’s a perception.  Some might call it a skewed perception, but it’s not enough for us to tell people to feel differently.  We have to show them, clearly and plainly and again and again and again, with a powerful economic plan for shared prosperity. America’s voters have been asking for this for years.  We heard it on Election Day last year.  By a margin of two to one, voters want to increase Social Security benefits; voters want to tax companies on overseas profits by three to one and increase funding for public schools by the same overwhelming margin—75% to 25%—three to one! Voters want public investment in infrastructure and a dozen other things.  Those same voters didn’t hear that loudly enough from enough Democrats.Listen, it’s time for you to show America who you really are.  It’s time to draw a sharp distinction, a clear and bright line, between you and the party on the other side of the aisle.  And the Number One working family issue today is the need to raise wages.  Start with the minimum wage, and then let’s make sure everyone gets paid for the work they actually do, including the extra work.  Over the past 35 years, the rules protecting the 40-hour week have collapsed.  Raising wages means restoring the 40-hour week, and making sure President Obama’s Department of Labor makes overtime rules strong again.Overtime protections are important.  So is respect for public workers.  It’s time to end the attacks on the people who teach our kids, plow our roads, and make our city, county, state and federal governments work.  Let’s acknowledge the importance of all working people.  We need to raise wages all up and down the labor market—and that requires the ability to bargain.I’m a political realist.  I know what you’re up against in this Congress.  We won’t get a lot of what we want this year.  But now is to the time to lay the groundwork for a new progressive majority, and you must show us what you will do by taking action on the things you can do.Take trade.  Here is an issue that goes right to the question of what you will do for working people.The body of evidence on bad trade deals has been building for years, and it says one thing: Our trade model drives down our wages, and increases inequality here and abroad.  Do what America wants and oppose Fast Track.  It’s nothing but a license to continue the same failed trade and economic policies that have emptied America of good jobs for the past 20 years.  We can outcompete any workers in the world on a level playing field, but we can’t face the competitive challenge of China with a fast-tracked trade deal that fails to address currency manipulation—which has cost us 5 million jobs—or climate change, or that grants rights to corporations that people don’t have.  That’s exactly what’s worst for America.And can you think of anything less popular with the American people?  Show America what you’re about.  Show the difference between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Oppose Fast Track.  Oppose Fast Track.  Or keep blurring the lines between red and blue.  Oppose Fast Track.  Trade can raise working people up, or it can drive us down.  American democracy is built on the idea that our elected leaders have the right to amend any piece of legislation that will affect us. Treaties almost more than any other kind of legislation need the full democratic process.  Don’t allow Fast Track to be negotiated in the dark.  It’s not right.  It takes away your ability to create good trade laws.  A vote for Fast Track now is giving up on working people without a fight.  You cannot claim you are fighting for jobs and middle-class incomes if you walk away from this battle.I’m going to say this one more time: Oppose Fast Track because it is the only leverage you have to insist that the president bring back a treaty that will raise wages and create jobs.Now, on immigration, you are in the right place—ready to defend the president’s executive action and committed to real common-sense reform.  We may not see a vote on comprehensive immigration reform this year—but Republicans will surely try to move H-1B guest worker bills to expand access to cheap labor.  For years we have been telling families to send their kids to school to get a high-tech degree—and even though in America we have enough graduates, Republicans want to triple the H-1B program to turn those good middle-class careers into low-paying temporary jobs.  This isn’t a fix.  It’s more of the same.  And we need your help to fight back.Your opponents have their sights on other targets, too, like workplace safety and public health. No one should lose their life, or their parent or child, to a preventable death on the job.  No one. You can help keep and make workplaces safer, and protect public health, but you’re going to have to stand up to the Republicans to do it.  You’ll have to stand up to them again and again and again.  America is hungry for a broad economic agenda to rebuild the middle class with raising wages. Give it to us.We’re doing our part.  This year, 5 million of us will be bargaining with employers over wages and benefits.  One million in three unions alone—the Communications Workers, the United Auto Workers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees—will negotiate major new contracts.As workers, we have been producing more and more while falling behind for too long.  The vast majority of Americans saw no wage gains between 2000 and 2012, and at the same time our productivity increased by 25%.We want what’s fair.  Those CWA and UAW and AFSCME workers have been steadfast.  They have taken their lumps during the hard times.  Now we want what’s fair, and what works for America.  You see, we’re ready to prove again that raising wages works.  It’s the best path to sustainable economic growth.Each and every worker in America must have that right to bargain for higher wages without fear. We don’t.  We need real labor law reform, so we ourselves can provide upward pressure on wages, on all wages, by sitting down across the table with our employers.  It’s fair.  It’s right. And it’s good for America and our economy.Let me give you an example of the problem today.  Walmart is America’s largest employer—and the largest employer of people on Medicare and food stamps.  Walmart workers have spoken up for better pay and fair schedules.  Walmart’s response has been illegal firings and illegal retaliation.  I want to know where you stand.  It’s time to make a choice. Do you stand with the Waltons?  The richest families in the United States?  Who break American laws and crush our nation’s wages?  Or do you stand with me, and with the men and women who stock the shelves and work the registers and who still live in poverty?Workers in America produce value, and we want what’s fair.  From McDonald’s to Boeing, from FairPoint to Amazon.  We are bargaining where we can, and we’re turning out into the street where we have to.  We will keep doing our part for ourselves and our economy.  We want equal pay and paid sick days.  It’s part of a broad economic agenda. But we need you to work with us, we want you to work with us, to do the rest, too, rebuild American manufacturing, balance our trade deficit, and make infrastructure investments that match the scale of our national needs in transportation, and modern communication systems, and education.You know how to win for America’s hard-working families.  You’ve done it many, many times. When Democrats stand up for a better future for the people who do the work, working people win and Democrats win. Do it again. Do it stronger. Do it now.Think of when you ended the Bush-era tax cuts for the richest 2%. You stood firm. You refused to negotiate over a ruinous plan to bankrupt America, and, despite dire predictions from the right wing and big business, nothing bad happened.  Ending those tax cuts allowed for real progress, more resources that we want and need, and there has been no downside.  There was no tax-mageddon, no crisis.Your opponents are desperate. They’ll do anything to convince you to use their economic playbook for the 1%, because they know how effective you can be for America’s families.Don’t fall for it. If the other party tries to tear America down, make them do it alone.  Instead, keep showing us a broad economic plan for raising wages. Show us we can still create shared prosperity. Show us again we are a nation that can take care of each other and provide for our families, a nation that honors our retirees and provides opportunity to those who need it. We can be a prosperous and a good nation. Show working people who you really are.You do your part.  We’ll do ours.  You support America’s hard-working families, and we’ll be there with you. We’ll knock on doors with you. We’ll leaflet with you. We’ll mobilize and phone bank and register voters. We will turn out the vote in 2016 together, and then we’ll win together!And now, I would love to entertain some questions. Thank you again for having me here. Who’s first?

368,Trumka Lays Out Comprehensive Raising Wages Agenda,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-lays-out-comprehensive-raising-wages-agenda,1-7-2015,"First, I want to thank Labor Secretary Tom Perez for opening the Summit today.  His leadership at the Department, his commitment to workers, and his energetic search for solutions were the perfect way to get things started today.And to all the workers who have been a part of this momentous day, you have the gratitude of workers everywhere.  It’s not easy to take off from your job, to leave your homes, and to come to Washington D.C. and be a part of something like this.  So to Ray Roldan of Painters District Council 11, Shantel Walker, of Fast Food Forward, Lisa Henson, a Maryland corrections officer with AFSCME Local 1427, Colby Harris of OUR Walmart, Mike Cantrell of UAW Local 42, Lakia Wilson of the Detroit Federation of Teachers, and Leon Speller of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 26, you have my heartfelt thanks.  Your involvement here today reminds everyone what Raising Wages is all about, and why it is so important.And Senator Elizabeth Warren -- she’s an inspiration.  Her vision of a Raising Wages America embodies our highest ideals.  Senator Warren is that rare political leader: she shares our values, she really connects with us, she is a genius when it comes to policy, and she is tough as nails when it comes to politics.  Senator Warren, thank you.  You have always been and will always be a remarkable champion of working people. And the Roundtable.  That was outstanding.  Thank you all very, very much.  You know, I’ve been to a lot of conferences and workshops and things like that.  I’ve never witnessed anything like this Roundtable – an open discussion with people from every corner of this movement.  A worker talking with a think tank president, a mayor learning from an activist, a small business owner sharing ideas with all of you.  This was refreshing, and important.  American politics needs this to happen more often.  And speaking of mayors, a big thanks to my friend Mayor Walsh.  Marty runs a big city, but he came here to be one among many on this Roundtable.  We are very appreciative. Last summer, when we decided to put this Summit together, we knew three things: one, that once again our productivity was up and our wages were flat.  America’s workers were creating more and more wealth for every hour we worked, yet most of us were slipping backwards.  Again.  The same story, over and over, year after year, with more and more suffering. Two, despite this grim, chronic news, or maybe because of it, there is something happening in America.  American workers are beginning to say “enough.”  We are beginning to rise up, to come together, to reject the idea that there is nothing we can do about falling wages.   We are tired of people talking about inequality as if nothing can be done.  The answer is simple—raise the wages of the 90% of Americans whose wages are lower today than they were in 1997.  Families don’t need to hear more about income inequality – they need more income. And three, we know that no matter what happened in the 2014 mid-term elections, 2015 would be a pivotal year.  It would be the year that politicians decided to stand up strong, or to retreat, afraid of responsibility.  To be very, very clear about what we need, or to be murky, saying a little of this, a little of that, and a lot of “maybe, kind of, sort of.”  To build our nation’s future, or to protect their own backsides with caution and corporate cash.So we are here on January 7, right at the start of the New Year, to declare a Raising Wages agenda.  Its elements are contained in the comprehensive policy framework we are releasing today.  We intend it to serve as a guidepost for all policymakers and all political candidates.  We want to know more than what you think about these issues, but what you will do about them.  If you want to see us on election day, we want to see you out there with the Fight for 15, with the brave folks at Our Walmart, with the Fairpoint strikers. That’s accountability, and for office holders and candidates it comes down to a basic question: are you satisfied with an America where the vast majority works harder and harder for less and less, or do you propose to build an America where we, the people, share in the wealth we create?  This is the single standard by which we will judge leadership.And the key word there is “we.”  We know that simple transactional politics are a dead end.  Not one of us can go it alone. We must unify on our common ground, raise the bar, then go out there and raise it even higher. In the past couple of years, I have seen collaboration like never before in the progressive world.  At the AFL-CIO, we made our 2013 Convention transformational by including hundreds of people and organizations who’d never been to a labor convention before.  We wanted to help unite the labor movement with all who share a vision of a better America.We hoped for exactly what we’ve heard today—people who share our vision of a better America coming together and getting things done.  Faith leaders partnered with digital activists to help organize unions.  Economists and Working America field organizers stood together to increase minimum wages.  Business leaders raised their voices with workers to create reasonable work schedules.  And on and on.We have to make it happen. We have to organize around a common purpose.  That’s what Raising Wages is all about. This Summit is about more than wages, though.  It’s about what wages represent. It’s a philosophy, a vision, and an agenda all rolled into one.  It’s a philosophy as old as America itself—that the people of America should share in the wealth we create.And it’s an agenda for change that starts with the absolute truth that no one should make less than the minimum wage, everyone should make a living wage, and collective bargaining should be available for all workers.  But it’s an agenda that must go far broader and deeper than that.  Raising wages requires a comprehensive economic agenda.  It means trade policies that lift incomes in America and around the world, rather than pit workers against each other in a race to the bottom.  It means strong, modern labor laws that give everyone who works in America a real opportunity to bargain for higher wages without fear.  It means treating Wall Street like it is part of America, not above America.  It means allowing workers to demand and win fair work schedules, paid sick leave, and overtime paychecks.  And raising wages means ending all tax benefits for companies that move jobs offshore.There are many other elements of the Raising Wages agenda – quality public education, secure retirement, equal pay, and more.  But I want to single out two subjects that we don’t automatically think about as work and wage issues: immigration and race.Let me put it plainly: our Raising Wages campaign can only be complete when there is justice for America’s immigrants and people of color.  We must have a pathway to citizenship for all immigrants, and we must be a country of dignity for all people, regardless of race or ethnicity.  Justice at work and justice in our community are intertwined, and both must advance for either to grow.This is how the work begins.  At the end of this marvelous day, our challenges are clear.  We have come together in a collective voice, and we are ready to go to work.  In that spirit, I am announcing that the AFL-CIO is launching an ambitious Raising Wages Call to Action.The foundation, and first call to action, is simple.  It’s something I said earlier – Raising Wages is the single standard by which leadership will be judged.  That means accountability, and it starts with something we all understand – presidential politics.  In 2015, the AFL-CIO and state partners will hold Raising Wage Summits in the first four presidential primary states – Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina.  And we’re not waiting around.  The first State Summit will be in Iowa this spring.  Each Summit will bring together diverse voices, just as we did today, to lay out the entire Raising Wages platform and establish state-based standards of accountability.Our second Call to Action puts everything we heard at the Summit today into practice.  We will bring to life what we heard repeatedly: that no one can do it alone.  Just as we have begun to undertake a number of coalition initiatives in five southern cities over the past year, beginning tomorrow, we will connect the Raising Wages campaign to seven additional cities around the country.  For several months, we have worked with our affiliates and community partners to determine where we can have the most impact.  In each of these seven cities, we will stand together with our affiliates and progressives already at work, and bring important energy, ideas, and resources to critical battles.These seven cities, which we are identifying today, are just the start of a longer term effort to concentrate our work where it will be most significant.  And that work will take many forms and go in many directions – Raising Wages is a living, searching idea, and there is no shortage of need.  Workers organizing and bargaining to raise wages.  A faith-based project to help immigrants navigate their work status.  A City Council living wage campaign.  Nurses and neighborhood groups fighting for paid sick leave and equal pay for equal work – all of that and more.  We have worked out many preliminary plans with affiliates and partners and are eager to turn up the heat. I’ve spent my life in the labor movement, so for me, Raising Wages is grounded in one idea: Our collective voice.  The very best way to raise wages is to protect workers’ full rights to engage in collective bargaining and hold employers accountable for violations of these rights. People may have forgotten, but the law of the land is to promote the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain.  Not obstruct it, not tolerate it – promote it.  As a first step, the labor movement will work with our allies on strong federal legislation that: 1) establishes very tough punishments for employers who retaliate against workers; and 2) provides appropriate remedies for workers who are unjustly treated.  As we heard today from Colby Harris with OUR Walmart, America needs to explore every avenue to bring our workplace laws into the 21st century and ensure that the collective voice is a powerful tool and not just an abstract idea. The collective voice is a powerful tool … and in America, it is the onlytool to bring about lasting justice.  So I want to ask each of you to embody your democratic ideals, to work with the fervor that is in your heart, to push your capacity, to always ask, “Why not?  “What’s next?” and “What is possible?”Because that’s what today is about.  Acting on what is possible.  Not waiting, not watching, not wishing.  Acting.  As we bring the Summit to a close, let’s remember that Raising Wages is not a hobby – it is our mission.  This is a beginning, not an ending.  Let’s make it a beginning that all of America will feel the impact of.I want to extend a very deep thanks to our host, Gallaudet University, to everyone here, and to all those watching on the Internet.  You have chosen to be a big part of a very big solution, and I know that together, we are going to make it happen.  Thank you.

369,Trumka: Criminal Justice Reform is a Labor Issue,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-criminal-justice-reform-labor-issue,10-10-2014,"Thank you, Sister Maria Elena [Durazo] for that warm introduction, and I want to thank you for inviting me to Homeboy Industries, which demonstrates so effectively how opportunities and support can help those individuals who have spent time in our criminal justice system, return successfully to society for a second chance at a new life.Your recipe for change is practical, designed to produce results: employment counseling, mental health services and legal help. And then there are the nuts-and-bolts services like tattoo removal. Best of all, your businesses, everything from your T-shirt and silk-screening business and food trucks, to the bakery and farmers’ market, are popular and profitable. You’re making a difference, one life at a time, and that’s how to make a lasting difference. I’m proud to be here.You are in business because mass incarceration has become a big business—a business whose product is low wages and blighted lives, and the time has come for us to do something about it.A few years ago I read a book called The New Jim Crow. I knew mass incarceration was a problem, but when I finished Michelle Alexander’s thoroughly detailed indictment of America’s prison system, I had a real moment.The book laid out what’s happening now, how we, as a nation, under the guise of public safety, spend billions making our country less safe, by forcing millions of people of color into a permanent criminal class. We have selectively locked people up, sealed people out and shut entire communities down.As I read the last few sentences of the book, I made a promise to myself that I would do everything in my power to help change this tragic reality.At the AFL-CIO Convention here in Los Angeles a year ago, I put the question to my brothers and sisters across America’s labor movement: Would we stand together to build a popular movement to reform our criminal justice systems? Our goal would be simple: To advocate for and win a system less “criminal” and more “just.”What I heard was a resounding, “YES!”We committed to do something about it. That brings me to why we are here.Our vision is a nation where redemption is possible through the virtues of hard work.  Yes, people make mistakes and commit crimes.  But they can learn from those mistakes and move on to productive lives with good-paying jobs and a future for themselves and their families, because every life has meaning. Every life has value. It’s one of the founding principles of this great republic.Think about our founding principles. I know for a fact the words “mass incarceration” are in neither the Declaration of Independence nor the Constitution. It’s an awkward phrase, isn’t it?  Maybe that’s because it’s hard to find a word for something so completely out-of-synch with America’s values.  It doesn’t fit. The experience of it doesn’t make sense.  So we call it “mass incarceration,” because all we can do is be literal about the facts. Yet before we talk about what mass incarceration is, I need to tell you what it isn’t. It isn’t a logical, fair or evenhanded response to crime, because the numbers tell us different.Today, one-third of black men in America will serve time in state or federal prison at some point in their lifetime. That’s twice the rate from the 1970s and over five times higher than for white men, even though long-term federal studies show us that black men and white men commit crimes at roughly the same rates.People of color are suspected more, arrested more, charged more, convicted more and imprisoned longer, and that ugly truth has helped America earn the terrible title of the most imprisoned of any developed country. We sentence people to prison at between 5 and 10 times the rate of any other advanced nation. The more you look at the numbers, the worse it gets.Let me make this next point emphatically. This is not a result of higher crime rates. This is because of lengthy mandatory minimums for drug offenses and “three-strikes” laws that put people away for life, for life. And for all its bluster, guess what? Mass incarceration has not even reduced crime.But it has been hell on families, especially children. Almost seven times as many kids had dads in prison in 2000 as in 1980.As you can imagine, a prison-at-all-costs mentality also runs up quite a price tag. Can you believe $80 billion a year? It’s true, and the number is four times higher when you count police, judicial and legal services.The story behind the facts is sad, disgraceful and racial, and the truth is we have done this to ourselves. We made one very stupid, sweeping assumption and then took an equally stupid and sweeping action. First, as a nation, we decided that young people of color are inherently dangerous. And then we decided to deal with that stupid and sweeping assumption by watching them like hawks, and if they made a mistake, we locked them up, kept them there, and forgot about it.Bad decisions based on bad impulses don’t usually end up well.  In this case, they ended up producing this “thing” called mass incarceration that has once again created a second class America based primarily on race.Racial profiling is at the heart of this epidemic of injustice.  Sometimes it seems we wrestle constantly with an impulse to discriminate and keep down our poor communities and our brown and black communities.Maybe we didn’t realize it while it was happening.  Maybe some of us chose not to realize it.  But now, through the courageous work of many in this room, California and the rest of America are beginning to wake up to the crime of mass incarceration. Waking up means understanding that this is an American issue, not an isolated race issue. We pay for it with our taxes by incarcerating instead of educating and employing. We pay for it when we lock people out of good jobs and housing. And we pay for it when we turn our backs on our brothers and sisters. The theme of this event is mass employment, not mass incarceration, because we need to put America back to work. That’s how our families thrive. That’s how our communities prosper. That’s how we can rebuild this country.Homeboy Industries is one of the answers, offering jobs and a second chance, but we need solutions across the board.Here are some ideas from America’s labor movement. We said at our convention last year that the American criminal justice system today spends too much on punishment and not enough to help people change. We need to reverse that. We said we believe people should get another chance to contribute to our society.We said we oppose mandatory sentences for nonviolent crimes, and we want to end the unnecessary and indiscriminate privatization of correctional facilities.We support restorative justice, things like job-training, education, probation and parole, programs that help people reintegrate in our communities. We support treating illegal drug use as a public health issue.And we support fully restoring all the rights of American citizenship for those who have served their time. Of course, that includes the right to vote and the right to serve on a jury but also public aid for education, housing and employment assistance.Some of you might be wondering, OK, yes, but why are labor leaders involved? Why do we care about reforming our criminal justice system and investing in crime prevention and rehabilitation?It’s a labor issue because mass incarceration means literally millions of people work jobs in prisons for pennies an hour—a hidden world of coerced labor here in the United States.  And when some people are forced to work for close to nothing, all workers’ living standards are pushed down.It’s a labor issue because those same people who work for pennies in prison, once they have served their time, find themselves locked out of the job market by employers who screen applicants for felony convictions.It’s a labor issue because families and entire communities crumble when able-bodied men and women come home and aren’t allowed to work.And it’s a labor issue because those people in our prisons are overwhelmingly young, and too many never recover from the damage prison does to their ability to function in the economy—low pay, unemployment and economic insecurity for millions of people means a less productive, less efficient economy for all of us.It’s a labor issue because millions of people have been barred from the polling booth and permanently excluded from our democracy, unable to advocate for good jobs and safe jobs and other working family priorities.It’s a labor issue because we are police officers and corrections officers, and too many of us in both the public and private sectors step into unsafe working conditions on the job.  Think about tensions in the prisons and on the streets caused by mandatory sentencing laws and prison overcrowding.It’s a labor issue because some companies are profiting from packed prisons while creating unsafe working conditions for correction officers.And finally it’s a labor issue, because labor rights and social justice and civil rights are intertwined. In America, 99% of us have to work for a living. We work together. We live side-by-side. We share the same communities. We share so much, and so we know that when we find injustice, we must call it out for what it is, and fight to make it right.That’s what makes this country the best on Earth. That’s what carries forward the best elements of America.Your advocacy on Proposition 47 here in California is carrying America forward. The Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act is leading the way.I support Prop 47, because it says every single one of us, every one of us, deserves the chance to turn our life around and to stop the cycle of prison and crime. Prop 47 offers an opportunity for a better life for California.Yet this will not be an easy fight. We have to educate millions of voters. We have to let people know that we are not “soft on crime.” We believe in the rule of law and we don’t believe in making excuses for people who have done terrible things.But we must emphasize that endless cycles of poverty and imprisonment threaten the freedoms and opportunities all of us hold dear as Americans.And, I believe, given the facts, America will stand with us.  When the stakes are high, America’s better angels rise to the occasion.  We’ve seen it in places like Selma, Alabama, we need it in places like Ferguson, Missouri, and we’ll fight for it throughout California.We’ll stand together, and work together, for real justice, for Prop 47, for an end to mass incarceration!  We’ll tell the truth, America’s justice is broken, and we’re gonna fix it.We’ll put it together, by walking together, by marching together, for justice and jobs, good pay and strong unions. This isn’t about your issues or my issues --- this is about our issuesSide by side, for Prop 47! Winning together for prison reform! Leading America with Prop 47!When you vote Prop 47 into law in California, our entire nation will begin changing its ideas about criminal justice.Every single day, California breaks ground on the path toward the future of a better America. I love you for it. I really do. God bless you, and keep up the good work!

370,Trumka to National Consumers League: We're Not Too Poor To Do the Right Thing,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-national-consumers-league-were-not-too-poor-do-right-thing,10-8-2014,"Thank you, Brother Cecil [Roberts], for those generous words of welcome. And thank you all for the honor of this recognition from an organization that does such important work. You see, paychecks and purchases go hand-in-hand in America, so when the National Consumers League fights to protect consumers on issues including fair and equitable access to credit, food safety and safe housing, you are fighting for workers as well. And we appreciate that.We also appreciate an ally who stands with us when the going gets tough. That’s why I want to particularly thank you, Sally [Greenberg], for the stand you took last year in St. Louis alongside retired coal miners and the United Mine Workers.I’m not sure if everyone here knows the story, but a profitable coal company tried to break its pension and health care promises to its retirees. You protested, Sally. You stood with miners and retirees. You got arrested. You got loaded into a paddy wagon with other protesters, and your demonstration of solidarity helped us hold that company accountable. And today the lives of thousands and thousands of retired miners and their families are better off because of it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And God bless you.Solidarity works. Standing together works.Sisters and brothers, I am especially privileged to receive this award alongside an activist as inspiring as Lara Granich. What an honor. Thank you. And I want to echo Lara’s sentiments on the importance of addressing social and economic justice in America today.  And there’s one point I want to make about doing the right thing, about doing things like fighting against predatory bank lending, about organizing against discrimination, and doing everything we can to treat each other with dignity and respect and decency. When we protect each other, we do not draw down on the balance sheet of our prosperity. It does not impoverish us to do the right thing. It enriches us.Some people would have us believe otherwise, believe America is poor, and that our poverty should prevent us from pursuing the course our values would have us follow. Some people would have us believe it would be nice to stomp out racism, and poverty, and hunger, if we could afford it. It would be nice to honor pensions, and the rights of workers to form unions, if only we could afford it. It would be nice to invest in American jobs, to enact comprehensive immigration reform, to rebuild our highways and bridges and to strengthen Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and public education and the whole nine yards, if it didn’t cost so much.That argument is a sham. America is as rich as it’s ever been in our history. We’re not too poor to do the right thing.And in fact, when we follow the course set by our shared American values, we will strengthen the bottom line of our families and of our nation. This is important. We cannot afford not to pursue our vision of the America we want for ourselves and our children! Good jobs, good roads, safe food, secure retirements and a quality public education, all those things will carry America along the road to prosperity. That’s how we get there. And the way we get there is together!I’d like you to think about this fact: from 1978 to 2013, CEO pay rocketed up by almost 1,000%, but the typical worker’s pay rose only 10%.Here’s another fact. Over the past 15 years, all of the income gains, not some, not most, not the majority, but every single penny, all of it went to the richest 10% in America. Everybody else works harder and harder, for less and less.Those numbers are the reason working people are so exhausted, so disappointed. Those numbers are the source of so much pain. I’d like to I ask you to think about what those numbers mean, in human terms. Imagine the rising pressure of a lifetime of working but never getting ahead. Think about the stress of retirement, and how do you retire when you’re only making a few dollars more than 10, 20 or even 30 years ago?Think about how low wages could push you toward credit cards and then payday lenders, and how fees on that quick money pull you into a deeper and deeper debt. That’s real pain that hurts men, women and kids, families. And that matters.I suspect, no, I know, that you understand how wrong this is. You’re not alone. All across this country, in poll after poll after poll, we hear self-described Democrats, Independents and Republicans say, “We want an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy few.”Three out of every four voters think we should raise the minimum wage. Nearly 70% of working-class Republicans say, “It shouldn’t be this hard to support a family.”And you see, it doesn’t have to be this way. The economy is not like the weather. It doesn’t simply happen to us. If we don’t like it, it’s not like it’ll simply change in two days, or two hours, depending on where you live.Our economy is shaped by rules created here in Washington, rules created by politicians we elect. Our economy is ruled not by chance but by choice. It’s broken, but we can fix it.We’re fighting alongside the National Consumers League here in Washington for strong financial safeguards for working families. We’re organizing in workplaces all over America, because collective bargaining is and always has been the best way to turn bad jobs into good jobs.And we can, and are, taking our economic message to the streets. Volunteers all across this great country are knocking on doors and explaining these simple truths, so we can mobilize more voters for the November elections. We’ll push our candidates to the finish line and then stay involved so we can hold them accountable after they take office.Politics is important. Advocacy is important. But the most transformational change is happening among workers who are standing together for a better life. Think of the fast food workers who have struck for $15 an hour. Think of the Walmart workers who stand together, and who find out how strong they are, how strong all of us are.We’re fighting as working people for a new chance to earn a decent life and to take care of our families. We may not know all the specific solutions to the problems we face, but we have the best tool there is, our solidarity. And with it, we will reshape the American economic landscape to make it more fair and equitable for all working people in a way that hasn’t been done in generations. You see, work should never trap us in poverty but lift us up.We want to stand with you, with all of you, whether you come from the world of labor or business, academia or advocacy.We in the labor movement hold powerful opinions about the rights of workers and the importance of collective bargaining and dignity and fairness on the job, but we don’t see ourselves as essentially in conflict with any institution or group in America.We will rise or fall together, all of us. And that’s why, when I became president of the AFL-CIO, I met with Tom Donahue of the Chamber of Commerce as soon as I could. Since then, Tom and I have spoken on Capitol Hill together for infrastructure investments, among other things. I have addressed the board of the Chamber, and Tom has spoken to the AFL-CIO.We may not agree on a lot of things, but we do agree on some. And I believe you learn more when you speak with people who don’t always agree with you, and you also have an opportunity to grow your circle of friends.In that way, I suppose, the AFL-CIO today is a lot like the National Consumer League. We have deep progressive roots. We build bridges and bring people together around common values and a shared vision. We are guided by solidarity. And we are always ready to make a stand for what we believe, and fight for what working people want and need, for what’s just, and what’s right. And that is how we win what working families need, in the workplace, the community and in our nation as a whole.Thank you for this honor, and God bless you.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

371,"Trumka in Detroit: Politics is a Matter of Choice, Not Chance",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-detroit-politics-matter-choice-not-chance,9-26-2014,"Thank you, Brother Rick [Blocker], for your warm words of introduction. I want to thank you, also, for bringing me to Detroit, to this great American city. It’s good to be back. But I want to offer my biggest thanks to all of you, for your generosity and for being here this evening. We have a lot of work to do, a lot of mobilizing and a lot of organizing, and with your help that’s what we’re going to do.You know, the political dial in Michigan, and all across America, has moved so far to the right, that it’s almost off the chart.Think for a minute about what your failure of a governor Rick Snyder stands for. Go through the list in your head. And think about what it means to working people, to have a failed governor, what it means not just in Michigan but all across our nation.Gov. Snyder stands for pushing every worker to the bottom, to a place with no unions, no prevailing wage, no decent funding for public education, no federal student loans, no retirement security or Medicaid, no voting rights, no job safety protections, no gender equity and no food safety standards. That is his vision, a corporate welfare state paid for by you and me and beholden to no one.Think about the damage Gov. Snyder has done to all of us. Think of the attacks on pensions that have intensified from New Jersey and Maine to Alaska and all across this country. Think of what the Michigan governor’s race means for the agenda of the anti-worker right-wing. I’m serious. Gov. Snyder is leading the way for a destructive new brand of Tea Party governors. He’s leading the way when he takes authority from local leaders and turns it over to bureaucrats who are only accountable to wealthy investors.  He’s leading the way when he lies to Michigan about passing right to work, when he slashes funding for public education and when he, each and every day, runs the state not for the good of the people but for his billionaire backers.He raised your taxes by $1.4 billion, on parents, retirees and working families, and then he cut education by a billion dollars, all to give billions in tax cuts to rich CEOs and wealthy corporations.  What did you get from those higher taxes?Did you get jobs?  No.  Michigan has the fifth highest unemployment rate in the nation, and Michigan is 49th in job creation.Did you get better schools?  No.  Classes are overcrowded and 52 school districts are bleeding money.Better roads?  Not even close. These roads are a mess.This is why Rick Snyder is a failure. But none of this is like the weather. It won’t just clear up in a few days. Politics is a matter of choice, not chance. This is the economy Rick Snyder created. We have to clear it up. We can change it. Brothers and sisters, we’ll change it by getting rid of your failed governor. Gov. Snyder has rigged every game for the richest of the rich, and he wants the cold, hard edge of the marketplace to run the world. If you’re too young, too old, too sick, too poor, too anything, it’s just tough luck.This isn’t about partisanship. Not every Democrat is a champion of working families. Nor is every Republican an enemy. But these days, too many Republicans are right-wing extremists. These politicians don’t govern, they dictate. And they keep cramming the right-wing agenda down our throat.And here’s the thing. These failed politicians, like Gov. Snyder, they know their values are not majority values, and that’s why they scheme to shrink our democracy, to cut back our ability to exercise our rights as Americans. That’s what the voter ID laws do. That’s what gerrymandering does. Their goal is simple, to rob Michigan’s people of fair representation. That’s un-American. And it’s plain wrong.Sisters and brothers, this isn’t business as usual. We’re seeing radical change coming fast. But we’re doing something about it. You are, this evening. We’re doing three things.Number one: We’re strengthening our unions. Number two: We’re strengthening our political program, so we can elect leaders who will stand with us, and then, number three, hold them accountable, so we can all stand united for a better life.It’s our job to make America work, because we are the workers of America, from the hotels to the high schools, we lay the foundations, teach the classes and make the cars. We build the roads. We do what it takes, no matter the cost. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night. This is our time. We’re taking our country back, to work for the people who work!All throughout our communities, collective action is on the rise. Populism is on the rise, and it isn’t growing along a partisan divide. It’s about values, not political parties.Collective action once again has grown as a topic in the national conversation, and people are taking action, from the fast food workers demanding $15 an hour and a union to Walmart workers taking on the richest family and the largest private employer in the world. Working people want results, and that includes some self-described Tea Party Republicans.You’re raising your voices here in Detroit, and it’s being heard. You’re saying it’s time to stop targeting regular working people to give more money to the rich and powerful. You’re saying, water for our families is more important than billions for a wealthy investor. We need balance, brothers and sisters.Three out of every four voters think we should raise the minimum wage. Nearly 70% of working class registered Republican voters say, “It shouldn’t be this hard to support a family.” More than 80% of all workers think America should stop shipping jobs overseas and support American manufacturing.This is all part of a new kind of populism, growing from our discontent, and not easy to define, yet it is very real, and it is reshaping America, and it gives us, over the next 41 days until Election Day, a prime opportunity to shape that change.You see, working people are united by the circumstances of our lives, and by the vision we share, and the values we share.And so it is up to you and me, to each of us, to connect with the workers who share our values, but who don’t yet see how our interests intersect.We are perfectly positioned to unite a massive movement, to raise wages and to lift up our communities. We have an opportunity to show every elected leader, from the White House on down, that those who stand proudly with working families, will win in November. It’s that simple.Imagine the strength we could have. It’s closer than you think. We can raise wages. We can win a day when the gap between the rich and the rest of us, starts to shrink.We are starting the powerful cycle of progress, sisters and brothers. This is how we end the downward slide and start to rise. Power and hope are growing. We’re on the right path. We’re moving forward, and we’ve got to keep going. We’re not there yet, but we’ll get there.We’ll stand together, to raise wages. We’ll march together, for a better life! For working families! For good pay! For a strong governor! For Michigan’s future!From where we stand, we can see the cycle of fairness and justice and progress. Let’s get to it. The billionaires may be against us, but Michigan is on our side.This isn’t about horse race politics. Don’t let poll numbers lift your spirits too high, or push them too low. It’s time for us to build power for working families. That’s what we’re doing. You see, by campaigning for Mark Schauer for governor, we can advance working people and end the political career of Rick Snyder. Mark Schauer will be a great leader for Michigan, and he’s doing his part. He’s running neck-and-neck. We can push him across the finish line, and that’s exactly what we’ll do!Detroit is ready, brothers and sisters! Michigan is ready! You make the difference. We’ll connect with more working-class voters, to get more working families to the polls, to build power and elect as many of the best leaders as we can, not just in Michigan, but in every corner of America.We’re changing lives—not small changes but big changes. We’re scrambling and reaching for a little more hope. We have a vision. And we’re making it real, because all of us pitch in, that’s shared responsibility, shared sacrifice.So get off your seat and on your feet, sisters and brothers. We’ll stand together, and win together! That’s how unionism works! That’s why the best way to a better tomorrow is still and always will be a union contract! We stand together! We’ll work for it.  We’ll fight for it.  Together.  And we’re gonna win together!Thank you! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
372,Trumka to Wisconsin AFL-CIO Delegates: Finish the Fight! ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-wisconsin-afl-cio-delegates-finish-fight,9-22-2014,"Thank you, Brother Phil [Neuenfeldt], for your warm words of introduction.  I want to thank you, also, for bringing me to your convention.  It’s good to be back in Wisconsin.You know, the political dial in Wisconsin, and all across America, has moved so far to the right that it’s almost off the chart.I believe it’s time to think hard, and remember, just exactly what Gov. Scott Walker stands for, not just in Wisconsin, but across America.  He is the symbol of the anti-worker, the very worst of the right-wing extreme.Gov. Walker stands for pushing every worker to the bottom, to a place with no unions, no prevailing wage, no decent public education funding, no federal student loans, no Social Security, no Medicare or Medicaid, no voting rights, no job safety protections, no gender equity and no food safety standards. That is his vision, a corporate welfare state paid for by you and beholden to no one. He’s not just willing for us to go to the bottom, he’s pushing us there!The eyes of workers everywhere are on you. Think about what we all face, because of Gov. Scott Walker. Think of the attacks that have intensified from New Jersey and Maine to Alaska and all across the country. Think of what Gov. Walker’s re-election would mean for the anti-worker politicians. I’m serious. Gov. Walker gave Wisconsin’s working families a razor sharp choice when he tore apart public-sector bargaining, slashed funding for education, turned his back on additional federal Medicaid money and ran the state not for the good of your people but for his billionaire backers.Let me ask you this: Is Wisconsin ready? Are you ready to finish this fight? Will we stand together?Are you ready?! Are you ready!?Brothers and sisters, Gov. Scott [Walker] wants to rig every game for the richest of the rich, and he wants nothing to blunt the cold, hard edge of the marketplace. If you’re too young, too old, too sick, too poor, too anything, it’s just tough luck.This isn’t about partisanship. Not every Democrat is a champion of working families. Nor is every Republican an enemy. We count many as friends. But these days, too many Republicans are right-wing extremists.They don’t govern, they rule. They run roughshod over anyone who disagrees with them. And so when Walker gets the call from the Koch Brothers. He’ll do what he did last time. He’ll keep cramming the right-wing agenda down Wisconsin’s throat, without so much as a “hello,” because he doesn’t give a damn about Wisconsin’s working families. He doesn’t give a damn about our vision for America, our vision of a nation where you and I can enjoy the fruits of our labor and the freedoms enshrined in our Constitution.And here’s the thing. These politicians like Gov. Walker, they know their values are not majority values, and that’s why they scheme to shrink our democracy, to cut back our ability to exercise our rights as Americans. That’s what the voter ID laws do. That’s what gerrymandering does.Listen to this. Wisconsin voters came out for working family Democrats overwhelmingly in 2012, but right-wing Republicans won five of eight U.S. House seats. The gerrymandering of Wisconsin districts happened like everything else Walker does, behind closed doors and shrouded in secrecy. And the goal was simple, to rob Wisconsin’s people of fair representation. These guys don’t care about representing Wisconsin. They only care about winning elections, one way or another. That’s un-American. And it’s plain wrong.Brothers and sisters, this isn’t business as usual. We’re seeing radical change coming fast. And the question we face is, will we meet the challenge? Or will it simply hit us, again, where we stand? Will it push us forward? Or will it knock us down?Because we have a choice, and I don’t know about you, but I hate losing, and I hate to see workers on the bench, or voters turned away. When a factory closes because some billionaires shipped more of our jobs offshore, first it breaks my heart and makes me mad. When a politician targets vulnerable public workers, nurses and snow plow drivers and firefighters, first, it hurts, and it makes me angry. And then I get to work, because we can and will win when we build our power.We are strengthening our unions, and growing partnerships with our community allies. I want to emphasize those last points to you. We’ve learned a lot these last few years. As a result, we’re better organized and more disciplined, more open, more accountable and more focused.We’re strengthening our political program, so we can elect leaders who will stand with us, and then hold them accountable, so we can stand united for a better life.It’s our job to make America work, because we are the workers of America, from the hotels to the high schools, we lay the foundations, teach the classes and weld the steel. We build the roads. We lift the loads and answer the call. We do what it takes, no matter the cost. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night. This is our country. This is our time. We’re taking our country back, to work for the people who work!All throughout our communities, collective action is on the rise. Populism is on the rise, and it’s about a common future, not political parties.Think about it. When Gov. Walker attacked collective bargaining, you fought back, hard! I can remember like it was yesterday. The crowds in Madison grew, ten thousand, forty thousand, fifty thousand, and then it swelled over 100,000! It was unprecedented, and it inspired our entire country to look again at this thing called “collective bargaining.” Your activism woke up America.And since then, collective action has grown as a topic in the national conversation, and people are taking action, from fast food workers to Walmart workers. Working people want results, and, by the way, that includes some self-described Tea Party Republicans.Three out of every four voters thinks we should raise the minimum wage. Nearly 70% of working class registered Republican voters say, “It shouldn’t be this hard to support a family.” More than 80% of all workers think America should stop shipping jobs overseas and support American manufacturing.All across this country, in poll after poll after poll, we hear Democrats, independents and Republicans say, “We want an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthiest.”This is all part of a new kind of populism, growing from our discontent and our hope, and not easy to define, yet it is very real, and it is reshaping America, and it gives us, over the next 43 days until Election Day, a prime opportunity to shape that change.You see, working people may embrace a range of philosophies, religions and political points of view, but we are united by the circumstances of our lives, and by the vision and the hopes we share.And so it is up to you and me, to each of us, to connect with the workers who share our values, but who don’t see yet how our interests intersect. It’s up to us to stand with the workers who need us most. Let’s join together, with everyone who wants to join with us.Our labor movement is perfectly positioned to unite a massive movement, to raise wages and to lift up our communities. We have an opportunity to show every elected leader, from the White House on down, that those who stand proudly with working families, will win in November. It’s that simple.Imagine the strength we could have. It’s closer than you think. We can raise wages. We can win a day when the gap between the rich and the rest of us, starts to shrink.Look at the Communications Workers of America. Just last week, 14,500 passenger service agents at American voted “Union Yes” to bargain for a better life.Imagine the boost raising wages will give American manufacturing, when millions of working people have the money, not the credit, but the money, to purchase the things we want and need, everything from paper to dishwashers, and everything else. You see, raising wages will fuel a strong cycle of growth, as companies invest and hire to meet demand.Working people are making it happen right here in Wisconsin. Fast food workers striking for $15 an hour and Walmart workers standing up for rights on the job, they’re giving America a jump start.We are starting the powerful cycle of progress, brothers and sisters. This is how we end the downward slide and start to rise. Power and hope are growing. We’re on the right path. Wisconsin moved America forward, and you can do it again. We’ve got to keep going. We’re not there yet, but we’ll get there.We’ll stand together, to raise wages. We’ll march together, for a better life! For working families! For good pay! For a strong future. For each other! We won’t back down, or back up, or step down, or shut up. We won’t be turned aside, or pushed back, or out-worked and we will not be denied!From where we stand, we can see down the race to the bottom, and up, to the cycle of fairness and justice and progress. Which way will we go? I can tell you one thing, the billionaires may be against us, but the American people are on our side. The people of Wisconsin are on our side.Right now, and for the next 44 days, we can do something about it, and I know you will.This isn’t about horse race politics. Don’t let poll numbers lift your spirits too high, or push them too low. It’s time for us to build power for working families. That’s what we’re doing. You see, by campaigning for Mary Burke for governor, we can advance our agenda and end the political career of the right-wing’s favorite poster boy. Mary Burke will be a great leader for Wisconsin, and she’s doing her part. She’s running a fantastic campaign, but we can push her across the finish line, and that’s exactly what we’ll do!We can stand and fight for Gwen Moore for the U.S. House. She’s a leader and a winner. She will fight to raise the minimum wage. She’ll support workers’ rights and voting rights. She’s the real deal, and if we work hard, we can win.We can campaign hard for Dean DeBroux. He’s a veteran and a teacher. He knows the importance of public education. He knows the power of the public good. Fight for Dean DeBroux for the Wisconsin Senate.Fight for Martha Laning! She’s a businesswoman with proven leadership skills, and the same values you and I hold dear. Martha will work to raise the minimum wage. She’ll protect education and health care and the vital services working families and seniors depend on. She’ll be a powerful leader for the future in Wisconsin’s Senate!And I want Penny Bernard Schaber at the top of your list for the Wisconsin Senate, too.Your candidates are what Wisconsin needs for a fair deal and a strong future. Right now, with this much at stake, it all comes down to our political program. And so I want every single one of you, every single one, to be fully engaged in Labor 2014. Go back to your locals and adopt days to canvass. Adopt nights on the predictive dialer. Add to the buzz. Get more bodies in the doors. I want to see full participation, full buy-in.Wisconsin is ready, brothers and sisters! I want you at the phone banks. Lead by example. Knock on the doors. We need the face-to-face conversations. That’s how we win elections. That’s how we build power. Personal contact works. I’m doing it, too, because our members do what our leaders do. You know it, too.As we get more involved, we’ll motivate volunteers. We’ll strengthen activists. We’ll help connect with more working-class voters, to get more working families to the polls, to build power and elect as many of the best leaders as we can, not just in Wisconsin, but in every corner of America.We’re changing lives—not small changes but big changes. We’re scrambling and reaching for a little more hope. We have a vision. And we’re making it real, because all of us pitch in, that’s shared responsibility, shared sacrifice.So get off your seat and on your feet, sisters and brothers. We’ll stand together, and win together! That’s how unions work! That’s why the best way to a better tomorrow is still and always will be a union contract! We stand together! And we’re gonna win together!We’ll work for it.  We’ll fight for it.  Together.  All of us. With solidarity. Real solidarity. Where your picket line is my picket line. And my picket line is your picket line. Shoulder to shoulder. Arm-in-arm. All day. Every day. As long as it takes. Standing together. Fighting together. Voting together. Winning together. Winning for unionism! Winning for Wisconsin! Winning for America!Thank you! God bless you!

373,"Trumka: ""Our brother killed our sister's son.""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-our-brother-killed-our-sisters-son,9-15-2014,"Thank you, Brother Mike [Louis] for that warm introduction and I want to thank you for inviting me to your convention. It’s great to be here in St. Louis—and I’m grateful to be here at such a critical time for Missouri, for our nation and for our movement.This hall is filled with leaders who have done so much to protect working people—all working people—in Missouri. You have built strength through unity—across industries and crafts, across the length and breadth of this state and—this is the hard one in America in 2014—across party lines.As a labor movement we once again face concerted attacks by those who have enormous wealth. The far-right is trying to divide us in many ways. But, here in in America, the power and dignity of working people will always win—as long as we stay united.Now, I’m going to stray from my usual convention speech. I’m going to talk about something that may be difficult and uncomfortable but I believe what I’m going to say needs to be said.You see, the question of unity brings up a hard subject, a subject all of us know about but few want to acknowledge—race. I’m talking about race in America and what that means for our communities, our movement and our nation.Because the reality is that while a young man named Michael Brown died just a short distance from us in Ferguson, from gunshot wounds from a police officer, other young men of color have died and will die in similar circumstances, in communities all across this country.It happened here but it could have happened—and does happen—anywhere in America. Because the reality is we still have racism in America.Now, some people might ask me why our labor movement should be involved in all that has happened since the tragic death of Michael Brown in Ferguson. And I want to answer that question directly. How can we not be involved?Union members’ lives have been profoundly damaged in ways that cannot be fixed. Lesley McSpadden, Michael Brown’s mother who works in a grocery store, is our sister, an AFL-CIO union member and Darren Wilson, the officer who killed Michael Brown, is a union member too and he is our brother. Our brother killed our sister’s son and we do not have to wait for the judgment of prosecutors or courts to tell us how terrible this is.So I say again, how can we not be involved? This tragedy and all the complexities of race and racism are a big part of our very big family as they always have been. A union is like a home. And in any home good and bad things happen. We have to deal with all of them, honestly.But that’s a philosophy. We can’t leave it at that. We have to look at real life today. We cannot wash our hands of the issues raised by Michael Brown’s death. That does not mean we prejudge the specifics of Michael Brown’s death or deny Officer Darren Wilson—or any other officer—his or her rights on the job or in the courts.  But it does demand that we clearly and openly discuss the reality of racism in American life. We must take responsibility for the past. Racism is part of our inheritance as Americans. Every city, every state and every region of this country has its own deep history with racism. And so does the labor movement.Here in St. Louis, in 1917, powerful corporations replaced white strikers with African American workers recruited from the Mississippi Delta with offers of wages far higher than anyone could make sharecropping. In response the St. Louis labor movement helped lead a blood bath against the African American community in East St. Louis. No one knows how many men, women and children were killed, and how many houses and businesses were burned. The NAACP estimated up to 200 died and 6,000 were left homeless. Eugene Debs, the founder of the National Railway Union called the East St. Louis massacre—and I quote—“a foul blot on the American labor movement.” It was one of the single most violent events in the history of American racism and it scarred this city, our labor movement and our country. When I think about an event like that—and there are plenty in our history all over this great country, and not all of them so long ago—I wonder what those white workers would say if they could stand where we stand today. What would they say about the choices to embrace hatred and division over unity and strength?What would they say about corporate bosses playing the race card over and over and over again in the years after 1917—breaking unions, crushing hopes and dreams. Yet remember, we are here today because labor leaders like A. Philip Randolph and Walter Reuther showed us there was a better way, not just for our unions, but for our country.But this not just about leaders of the past and tragedies of yesterday. If we in the labor movement truly want to act as a positive force for change around issues of racism and classism we have to acknowledge our own shortcomings. We as a movement have not always done our best to support our brothers and sisters of color who face challenges both on and off the job—challenges that you don’t really understand unless you live them.The test of our movement’s commitment to our legacy is not whether we post Dr. King’s picture in our union halls, it is do we take up his fight when the going gets tough, when the fight gets real against the evils that still exist today.When a new immigrant gets mistreated by management because they don’t speak the language, that is our fight. When an African American worker doesn’t get a promotion or fair pay because of the color of his or her skin, that is our fight. When women are paid less than men for the same work, that is a fight for every single one of us. We cannot afford to have “my issues” and “your issue,” we must ALL stand together and mobilize around our issues.You see, we have a choice: We can either live our history or we can change it.Now as you may be able to tell this matter is deeply personal with me. When I sit at my conference table at the AFL-CIO, I look across the office at a picture of my dad. He’s gone now but if you’ve lost a parent you know they never stop talking to you. My dad was a miner, he helped build the United Mine Workers, he bled for his union and he went to war for our country in the Pacific in World War II.As I worked on this speech this is what my dad said to me. He reminded me of something that happened when I was maybe five or six. I come from a small coal-mining town in southwest Pennsylvania called Nemacolin. My best friend back then was a kid named Tom and Tommy was African American. There was a park near us called Shady Grove Park with a swimming pool where you had to pay to swim. And one day my dad drove us there to go swimming. We came up to the booth to pay. It was one of those places where you pull up and pay for everyone in the car. The guy looks in and sees Tommy in the car and tells my dad, “That boy can’t swim in here. You know he can’t.”My dad never raised his voice but he said, “You take out for him. We’re going swimming.”The guy said, “He can’t swim here,” and my dad said, “We’re going swimming.”Now, I don’t know whether he took out for Tommy or not but we went in and me and Tommy went through the changing room and jumped in the pool. It was a hot day and the pool was packed. We jumped in and everywhere we went it was like there was a circle of open water all around us. When we moved the circle of clear water moved. Well, we swam until we got tired and then we got out and dried off and got something to eat and that was that.Later, I asked my dad about the man in the booth, I wanted to know why he didn’t like Tommy. My dad explained that it didn’t have anything to do with Tommy but with the color of his skin. I protested. I said, that’s not fair. My dad said that’s the whole point. So let me come back to what’s happened, specifically in Ferguson: It isn’t fair and that’s the whole point.I have a son. He’s not so young anymore but he’s not so old. I don’t worry about him. I don’t know but I have a suspicion that like many of you, and certainly like me at that age, he may not always obey the nation’s traffic laws. So I worry he might wrap himself around a tree. But I never worry when he goes for a cross country road trip or a night on the town that he may be stopped, shot to death by a police officer.But for millions of mothers and fathers of young African American men and boys, men just like my son and boys that were as young as me and my friend Tommy—kids with promising futures in America, it is a constant fear, a constant fear.And if you don’t feel that fear yourself I’d just ask you, for a moment, to think about that. Think about what it would be like to watch your kid walk out the door and wonder, with good reason, if it’s the last time you’ll see him alive. Because you know it happens. If you haven’t had a close call yourself, you know people who have: friends, family, neighbors and people you worship with.And it doesn’t stop there. Unfortunately teenagers of all races often experiment with drugs. But only some of our sons and daughters are suffering terribly long terms in prisons for the same nonviolent petty crimes which we all know many of us did as kids. And you can’t get around the fact that those who fill our prisons are disproportionately people of color.This is not somebody else’s problem. This is the reality of life for millions of our brothers and sisters. And so it is our problem. That is what solidarity means.Brothers and sisters, I know there are no easy answers here. But we must use the occasion of the tragic death of Michael Brown and its aftermath here in St. Louis to begin a serious and open-ended conversation about what we can do, about what we should do.That conversation needs to be about racism and some other things as well. Call it classism, call it the blindness of our nation to the poor of all races and nationalities. Call it contempt for the people who do the work in our country. It needs to be addressed.Consider this: We live in a country of runaway inequality, of widespread desperation amid staggering wealth. In truth, we ask our public-sector workers to manage this for us. And then our politicians and our media blame them no matter what happens; blame the teacher in the defunded school, the firefighter with 20-year-old equipment and the nurse who is given yet another 12-hour shift.And think about what it means to be a police officer in this country where violence is so often the norm—about walking up to cars anticipating the worst, over and over again. None of us can really know the toll this takes unless we have worn the uniform. This reality, this experience, must be part of any conversation about how we move forward from what has happened here in Ferguson.But the answer starts with candor, not firepower. We cannot militarize our police. A free society is policed by a civilian police force, democratically accountable to the community it protects. Of course, our officers need the equipment and the training and the staffing to protect themselves and to protect us. But let’s not forget what our history teaches us: it’s always the employers who want the paramilitary forces, the National Guard, bayonets and armored cars and the weapons always end up pointed at us. The decision to militarize is always made up the chain of command, not by the citizenry or by rank-and-file police officers.So we’ve got to talk to each other, not past each other. We’ve got to talk about how to help our police officers serve our communities. We’ve got to talk about registering and educating voters about jobs and housing and raising wages for all, and we’ve got to talk about accountability—about making sure the public has confidence that the laws of our nation will be enforced and enforced equally. And we have to do more than talk; we have to listen and then we have to act.I’m not saying this is easy. If I knew how to fix the hurt in our communities I would tell you. But I know how to start and that’s by listening. So later today I’m going to be doing a lot of listening, here at this convention and then at a meeting in Ferguson with the leaders of that working class community because we as a labor movement have to be part of the communities our members live in.Sisters and brothers, just as was true a hundred years ago, when we try to move forward there will be some people who will want to foment racism, to divide us for their own benefit. Those are the same people who always want to set workers against each other—private-sector workers against public-sector workers, native-born against immigrants. And about that, I can only say this: if we let that happen, we lose. Every time.It’s time to draw the line. Some people are still getting hurt in our communities because of the color of their skin and that’s not right. One moment of bad luck, one dumb mistake, one misstep should not end a life.Nor should it put someone in prison for decades and rob them of their right to participate in our democracy for the rest of their lives.That’s nothing but second-class citizenry and that’s wrong in America.The United States of America is the greatest country in the world. It’s a beacon of hope. The very name “America,” means freedom. It means fairness. It means justice. It means equality.  And facing our problems, our flaws, is part of our greatness.Now I know each and every one of you became involved in our labor movement because you hunger for justice. You hunger for fairness. It’s in your blood.And you’ve learned the hard way that justice and fairness just don’t happen—we have to make it happen—we have to build power, we have to use that power to fight and we can never stop. Because in this country, in the richest nation on earth, at the richest time in our history, fairness and justice are not too much to ask whatever the color of our skin, whoever we love, no matter our gender, our religion or anything else, because we are the workers of America: from the hotel to the high schools, we lay the foundations. We teach the classes. We drive the buses. We build the roads. Brothers and sisters, we lift the loads and answer the call. We do what it takes no matter the cost. We wake our country up every single day and we tuck her into bed at night. We won’t be turned aside. We won’t be divided.Earlier I said, ""I hope the tragedy in Ferguson can push us to make positive change"" and I am hopeful this change has already begun to happen. I know I have been changed. Yet as a community we have a long, long way to go and a lot of work to do.Now, I don’t have to tell anyone here how our labor movement operates. We carry out our activism in our communities and in the workplace and we carry out our activism at the ballot box. We’re ramping up all three right now.It’s a good thing, too because the time is right. For 40 years, we’ve been living a story of decline as so much of what made our nation great has been pushed into disrepair as our roads and bridges crumble and fall away and as public investment in social services, public education, housing, transportation, research and medicine has been cut so politicians can give more tax cuts to the super-rich, especially the wealthiest one-tenth of 1%.For decades, the far-right CEOs and billionaires have sought to divide us, to disempower us. In the past few years, we’ve seen a rash of Voter ID laws to deny the vote to millions of people of color, to young people and the elderly. We have seen the demonization of immigrants. We have seen workers vilified, our rights attacked in Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and right here in Missouri. But that’s the old story. There is a new story in America—and it doesn’t come from Washington or politicians.Working people are coming together, standing together in the workplace and in the polling place and in the streets. People are talking about collective action and economic inequality.People are talking about collective bargaining, people who never spoke the words before. We’ve marched together with fast food workers who demand fairness and dignity and $15 an hour right here in St. Louis. My hat’s off to those courageous workers! God love each and every one of them!And brothers and sisters, how about the Walmart workers—taking on the richest family and the largest private employer in the world.And how about the men and women—predominantly people of color, who drive and fix the buses and staff the Metro bus system here in St. Louis—no pay raise in six years. I heard just last night that a tentative deal was reached to save pensions while it’s still subject to agency notification and union ratification, I want to thank Mayor Slay for his help in getting to this point. And how about the Missouri AFL-CIO?You built a bipartisan coalition to defeat right to work. Our opponents thought it was a done deal. It wasn’t. And it won’t be. We’re living a new story in America.You see, working people stand united in our desire for economic change. A powerful majority—not just union members—want the minimum wage raised.An even larger majority wants good American manufacturing jobs and a rebuilt infrastructure, not more bad trade deals and corporate tax rip-offs. Between now and November 4, we have a chance to show candidates that supporting a working families’ agenda is the sure way to win. We can demonstrate how powerful unity is. And we can win for candidates who want to raise wages and who will represent all of us and who will make work lift us up, not hold us down.Right now we have a chance to grow power for Missouri’s working families with our political program and across our society. And in that effort I want every single one of you—every single one—to be fully engaged in Labor 2014. I want to see full participation, full buy-in.We’ve got to do it to keep out right to work and to defeat the constitutional amendment attacking teacher tenure. I want you in the phone banks. Lead by example. Knock on the doors.We need the face-to-face conversations. That’s how we win elections. I’m doing it, too, because our members do what our leaders do. You know it’s true.  And let me tell you something if you think we are in trouble now, it’s going to be so much worse if we don’t get off our butts and work like hell between now and Nov. 4. So let’s wake up before it’s too late. We’ll motivate volunteers. We’ll strengthen activists. We’ll connect with more working-class voters and get more working families to the polls. And we need to be out in our communities—building larger working-class political alliances. That’s how we break the isolation.  That’s how we fight racism. That’s how we win. We have a vision—a big vision of a better nation. And we’re making it real because all of us pitch in because we are moving forward, together, in solidarity, because we can learn from even the worst tragedy, because all of us together have the power to make a new day for America!So get off your seat and on your feet, sisters and brothers.When we stand together and fight together, we win together!We’ll work for it. We’ll fight for it. Together. All of us. Together. With solidarity. Real solidarity.Black and white, immigrant and native born, gay and straight. Where your picket line is my picket line. And my picket line is your picket line. Shoulder to shoulder. Arm-in-arm. All day. Every day. As long as it takes. Standing together. Fighting together. Voting together. Winning together. Winning for working families!  Winning for America! Thank you! God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
374,Trumka Lays Out Labor's Vision for Natural Gas,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-lays-out-labors-vision-natural-gas,9-8-2014,"Thank you, Brother Mike [Langford], for your overly kind words of introduction. Also, I want to thank you for inviting me to this important convention, and to thank the UWUA for hosting us all.Lastly, I am glad to acknowledge my fellow attendees. It’s good to be here with each and every one of you, union members in a critical industry, at such an important point in our history, and in the history of our country.Brothers and sisters, I want to talk to you about some difficult subjects, about politics and politicians, about Democrats and Republicans, about the economic and social issues of our day, and where we stand in the middle of it all, as working people and as a labor movement.Politics matter, elections matter, and I’m going to ask you to get to work, when you get back to your locals, to fill your phone bank with volunteers, to knock on doors, to leaflet your worksites, because in every corner of this country, we have ideas and plans to rebuild the American middle class and shared prosperity.We are building a movement, and the issues you are most concerned about, about investments in America’s infrastructure, about projects to repair and improve natural gas lines, and smart government regulations to make sure America’s natural gas infrastructure is reliable and our neighborhoods are safe. Those priorities require the right leaders, leaders who listen to working families, who sit across the table from us, to turn our priorities into realities.As a movement, we’re putting our agenda out front. That’s what’s driving our politics. Not the other way around. We’re not building power for any political party. We’re not building power for any candidate, no matter who. We’re building for working people, period.For 40 years, our economy and the prospects of our working families have suffered and declined. We’ve seen an ever-larger share of America’s productivity go to the wealthiest 1%, and the lion’s share has gone to the richest one-tenth of 1%, leaving very little for the rest of us.We’ve seen jobs outsourced and off-shored. Retirement security, all of it, has gone downhill. College debt is at an all-time high, and there are too few jobs for today’s graduates. But that’s the old story. Something new in America is happening today. The new story is people are ready to do something about it.All over this country, from fast food restaurants to taxi stands, from Walmart and Target to the growing ranks of Working America, people are ready to take action. Just take a look at the workers at Market Basket, who fought against greedy shareholders to bring back a good CEO. That’s what it means to stand up and take action.Workers are debating big issues, like wages good enough to live decently, and raise a family if we want to. The public is debating collective power. And collective bargaining. We’re talking about rights on the job.We’ve been wanting this conversation for a long time, and guess what? We’re winning.Let me tell you something, it’s not going to be easy, but we’re going to turn the tide, because we’ve got what America needs. America wants and needs good jobs, and unionism works. We know how to stand together for a fair share of what we create. When we bargain for good pay and benefits at the power plant, our entire community does that much better. And we’re here to say, to every worker out there, if you stand with us, we’ll stand with you.That’s how we’ll build a movement big enough to lift up all working families, big enough to rebuild the American middle class. We did it once. We’ll do it again.Sisters and brothers, we will help working families use unionism to build a better life. Solidarity builds strong careers, strong families, strong communities and a bright future for the United States of America.We know a union is the best tool to win respect, to turn a bad job into a good job, one with good pay and benefits and a chance for a secure retirement, because when we stand together, we’re powerful. We earn respect. There’s no denying it. Unionism works.The best way to fair pay, is a union contract.The best way to retirement security, is a union contract.The best way to a safer job, to a better tomorrow, so you can give your family a decent life and a strong future, it all comes back to a union contract.We live in the richest country on this Earth, at its richest time in history, and a decent life is not too much to ask, because we’re the workers of America, from the power plant to the pipeline, we build the systems and keep them running. We fix the gas mains and answer the call. We do what it takes, no matter the cost. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night. We won’t be turned aside. We won’t sit down or back up or shut up, and we will not be denied. This is our country, and it’s time we made it work for workers!Just about a week and a half ago, in Dallas, Texas, in the early morning hours, a natural gas leak caused a home to explode. We hear about news like this all too often. This time, a mother and her child went to the hospital with burns. Both are expected to do fine.No one was injured in another explosion in Missouri on the same day, but similar blasts in Kansas, Georgia, New York and Pennsylvania—in just the last few weeks alone— seriously injured some people and killed others. That’s not right. That’s not just.Time and again, fire officials and investigators point the finger of blame at aging pipelines and other infrastructure failures.We’ve got to do something about this. Our infrastructure, which is supposed to benefit us all, has become a danger to gas workers. Our infrastructure poses a threat to our communities. We’re talking about the safety of our families, the lives of our children, the lives of workers.In California, our labor movement helped pass new regulations to upgrade our infrastructure, and not one single legislator stood against it.Yet a similar proposal on Capitol Hill wouldn’t stand a chance. Too many politicians refuse outright to consider any regulation at all. Too many politicians simply won’t make any investments in infrastructure, not at all. They say we can’t afford to roads or bridges or to repair leaky gas lines. They say we have to cut back. They say we can’t afford to create jobs. They say it’s too expensive.It’s up to you and me, it’s our job to spread the word, because we can’t afford not to fix those leaks. Not acting is the most expensive idea out there.Listen, I’ve been meeting with workers all over this country, from Alaska to Nevada and from Pennsylvania to Florida, people are concerned about jobs. I hear talk about infrastructure, and the need for us to build a new union tradition for our children, and our children’s children.
You see, a new caliber of activism is spreading across our entire labor movement. At the AFL-CIO we’re strengthening our state federations of labor and central labor councils. And believe me, that strategy alone could transform our movement. We’re joining together with allies, in ways we never have before. We’re a mainstream movement, a growing movement, a powerful movement, a popular movement, and we’re acting like it.You see, we can and will bring working people together. We’ve already started. Working people share a lot more than most of us think. In our research, we’ve found what we’re calling Tea Party populists, and we’ll stand with them. Together we can turn sour cynicism into stubborn action. It’s time for us to believe in our movement. It’s time for us to believe in ourselves, believe in the progress that’s possible in our democracy when workers stand together.You see, we care about the same thing, 75% of American voters want investments in infrastructure, schools, research and transportation, paid for by closing tax loopholes for the rich. It’s an idea that unites America, and 82% of the public wants good American manufacturing jobs, not more bad trade deals. That’s an idea that unites us all.The issues go on and on. America’s workers want work to pay. We want work to lift us up, not hold us down. Those ideas unite America!It’s up to you and me, to each of us, to help make the voices of America, our America, heard at the ballot box, in the workplace and in our national life. And we’re doing it.Power and hope are rising. We’re ready to rebuild America’s middle class. We did it once. We’ll do it again.We’ll stand together, to raise wages for all. We’ll fight for utility workers and day laborers, for bakers and drivers and teachers! We’ll march together! For working families! For good pay. We’ll stand together! For a strong future. For each other! We’ll shout here in Florida and all across America. And we’ll show how much good raising wages can do.Brothers and sisters, we have big things to do as a country—put our people back to work, restore our democracy and build 21st century infrastructure. We’ve got ideas on how to build American manufacturing, to strengthen our communities and rebuild our tax base. We’re going to invest in American jobs, not throw them away.And we want labor law reform, so all workers can stand together to bargain for a better life.Listen, I know when we talk about labor law reform, it brings up bad feelings. Let me tell you something: as labor leaders, we have learned some hard lessons, really hard political lessons.Yet I want you to listen very closely to what I have to say, we’re stronger because of the lessons we’ve learned. We’re more independent because of the lessons we’ve learned. We’re more focused, more disciplined, more creative, and ultimately more powerful because of the lessons we’ve learned.All across our labor movement, we’re looking to fight for our values, not for any political party.You see, we don’t work for candidates. We are not building power for the Democratic Party. Not the Republican Party. We’re building power for working people, pure and simple. We’re looking at the long view. We’ll work with anybody who will work with us. And we’re not afraid of holding anybody’s feet to the fire. Working families need results. Period.And I tell you, we’ve got a long memory, and we will not hold our nose and endorse Democrats, just because they have a D next to their name. That’s not good enough. It won’t happen.We’re looking close and asking hard questions of every candidate who wants our support, and one question we want every candidate to answer is, do you support America’s workers? Do you support our right to bargain collectively for a better life? Do you believe in pensions? Will you grow our economy? Will you raise wages?And I promise, I swear, nobody will work harder, or smarter, or longer, to elect the leaders who make the right commitments, and nobody will work harder, or longer, to defeat those who don’t, regardless of political party.I’ve got a big ask for you this electoral season. I want you to do this with me. I want you to lead with me. I want you to work like you never have before. Be the leaders who lead by example. Be the first to knock on doors. Make the first call at the phone banks. I’ll be doing it, too.We’ll motivate our volunteers. We’ll strengthen our activists. We’ll help each other connect with more working-class voters, get more working families to the polls, because if we want to win the policies we need, if we want infrastructure investments, we’ve got to engage and activate everyone within our reach.We need release staff, and we need them now to turn out our people. Make the commitment. I’m asking you to make it now.When I say, “our people,” I mean union members and families but also like-minded folks in our neighborhoods and communities.And here’s the best part, after the polls close on Election Day, we’ll have a stronger network, of activists and local leaders, ready to mobilize and pressure our local, state and national leaders for the policies we need, and we’ll stand ready to support our organizing for the union members of tomorrow.Standing together, working people will change this country, our country, America the beautiful!We’re lifting up lives. We won’t settle for less. We want a bold future, and that’s what we’ll get. We’re scrambling and reaching for a little more hope. We have a vision. And we’re going to make it real, because all of us pitch in, that’s shared responsibility, shared sacrifice. That’s how we win.What we want is simple. It’s what everybody want, the chance to work hard for a decent life, and to give a better life to our kids. We’ll stand together, because we’re strong together.We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers. We’ll stand for it. Together. Each of us. Utility workers with crane operators. Letter carriers with hotel workers. Taxi drivers with mine workers. With solidarity. Real solidarity. Where your picket line is my picket line. And my picket line is your picket line. Shoulder to shoulder. Arm-in-arm. All day. Every day. As long as it takes. To win together. To raise wages. To grow together. To bring out the best in ourselves, to bring out the best in each other. To bring out the best in America. For the America we can have, and must have, and will have. Keep fighting. Keep winning.Thank you, and God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
375,Trumka on Labor Day: Work Lifts Us Up,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-labor-day-work-lifts-us,9-1-2014,"Happy Labor Day! It’s great to be in Pittsburgh!Everything comes together on Labor Day. First, we’re here to celebrate work. Work lifts us up, gives us dignity, provides for our families. And Labor Day is all about lifting ourselves up, about raising wages, and that’s what we’re going to do. That’s what you’re doing in Pittsburgh, by putting organizing front and center.Number two, as we celebrate work, we also appreciate the rights we have in this great country, the rights to free speech and free assembly, including the right to stand together on the job in a union to bargain collectively for a better life, so our economy can work for all of us, not just the wealthy few.Number three is the responsibility that comes with those rights. Number three is our political action. Number three means we all register to vote, and we register others, too. Number three means we educate ourselves and each other. Number three means supporting leaders like your next governor Tom Wolf, because when he’s in office he’s going to work for working people, not the wealthy donors and extremists!Number three means supporting leaders like Mike Doyle, and Tim Murphy, and Mayor Bill Peduto, and all our leaders in the Pennsylvania state house, and state senate, and on the city and county councils who support working people. Number three means all of us are going to vote for candidates who stand with working people, who will invest in good jobs, schools, transportation, research and our future by closing tax loopholes on big corporations and the rich! They’ll stand with us to turn back right to work, and privatization, and pension cuts and education cuts!On Labor Day, brothers and sisters, everything comes together. I see workers who want to organize, who want to raise wages. I see candidates like Tom Wolf who want to help, and I see a great big crowd of people here who will all stand together, to win a better future at Rivers Casino, at Duquesne University and UMPC, and a better future for Pennsylvania!It’s going to happen! Power and hope are rising, sisters and brothers. We’re on the right path, and Pittsburgh is leading the way!We’ll stand together, to raise wages. We’ll march together, for a better tomorrow! For working families! For good pay! For a strong future! For each other! We won’t back down, or back up, or step down, or shut up. We won’t be turned aside, or pushed back, or out-worked, and we will not be denied! Keep fighting! Keep winning! And keep leading the way!Happy Labor Day! And God bless you!

376,Trumka to Alaska AFL-CIO Delegates: We're Taking Back Our Country,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-alaska-afl-cio-delegates-were-taking-back-our-country,8-21-2014,"Thank you, Brother Vince [Beltrami], for that kind introduction. And thank you for inviting me to your convention. It’s good to be back in Alaska.Let me tell you something, Alaska is a beautiful place. I’ll be honest, I love my job, and I wouldn’t trade it for the world—but I wouldn’t mind having an office up here. I have a ridiculously good time in Alaska, and not just when I’m out fishing. You are truly living in God’s country, so thank you all for bringing me back.I’ve got some good stuff to talk to you about. I want to thank you and congratulate you for being one of the few state federations of labor to successfully endorse, fight for and work with Democratic and Republican leaders. That’s political independence. I’m not saying things are perfect today, but your record in that department is strong. Alaska provides a working model, and I commend you for it.Here’s another piece of good news. The people of Alaska have warmed to our community affiliate Working America in a big way, and you should all be proud of that. In just the last few months, Working America up here has gained 5,000 members. That doesn’t happen by accident, and so I want to thank everyone who has been involved with the growth of Working America.Okay, now as you know, Alaska is not a cheap place to live. Hell, heating oil in Fairbanks is outrageous. I don’t know how some of your working families here can keep the house warm.Every worker in Alaska needs a raise, and I know a good place to start. A higher minimum wage will lift more working families toward a living wage and put upward pressure on all wages. You’ve done great work to get a higher minimum wage on the ballot this fall, and you’re a step ahead of the pack because you’ll index the wage to inflation. But I’d also encourage you all to look a step further to think about how solidarity, how a union on the job, could lift Alaska’s workers that much more.I’d like each and everyone here to think hard about the people you know, your friends and neighbors, family members and just those people you see around town on a regular basis.And I want you to think to yourself, could solidarity help your neighbor? Could it help relieve energy costs in Fairbanks so our young families and elderly parents on fixed incomes can live more securely?Brothers and sisters, we aim to help working families use unionism to build a better life. I’m not saying that because I like the sound of the words. I’m saying it because it’s true. Unionism works. Solidarity builds strong careers, strong families, strong communities and a strong future for the United States of America.The best way to fair pay, is a union contract.The best way to retirement security, is a union contract.The best way to a better tomorrow, so you can give your family a decent life and a strong future, it all comes back to a union contract.Yet politicians can rob us of the right to have or keep a union on the job. Politics matter.Anchorage politics matter. Fairbanks politics matter. You’re on the top of the list for the right-wing and its right-to-work scam. They’re coming after us in city councils. They’re attacking working people at the state level. But if we build power, and we build it right, we can win what we want and need, so more hard-working Alaskans can bargain together for a decent life.A decent life is not too much to ask, because we’re the workers of America, from the railroad tracks to the overpass, from the hotel to the high school, we lay the foundations and teach the classes. We bake the bread and build the roads. We lift the loads and answer the call. We do what it takes, no matter the cost. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night. We won’t be turned aside. We won’t sit down or back up or shut up. We won’t be faced down, and we will not be denied. This is our country. This is our time. Right now. We’re taking back our country, so she works for the people who work!Sisters and brothers, in the past few months, I’ve spoken to workers all across the United States, and to be perfectly honest with you, the people I talk to are confused and angry, frustrated and scared. They tell me they’re worried about the future. They’re concerned about the life their kids are going to lead. And they’re wondering why, this long after the financial collapse of 2008, too little has changed.I want you to know I understand that frustration, fear and confusion. Let’s consider what’s happened over the past 40 years, how productivity rose while wages froze, which meant virtually all of the wealth created by our growing economy has gone to the richest 1%.All across this country, as union men and women do the work of representing our members, we’ve seen the hardship. We’ve seen how corporations sometimes rig themselves to fail, so executives can break pension promises, and walk away with millions. And we’ve seen profitable companies use the struggles down the street to justify their own health care cuts and take-back contracts.And when a factory or plant closes, or moves its production to China or somewhere else, all of us have seen the ripple effects move across our communities, from half-empty classrooms and “For Sale” signs in the front yards to restaurant closures and vacant storefronts.And it hits home, doesn’t it? When you lose a job it’s not a number. It’s stressful. There are fights over finances. Worn out clothes that just have to be worn anyway. Nothing much for the kids at Christmas. Stuff that counts. Stuff that hurts.The corporate right wing aims to extend this story for another 40 years, and make it even tougher on all of us.We’ve got another plan. We see a different opportunity. You see, this whole situation has given workers everywhere a hard-won education in real economics. And here’s why I’m telling you this: The biggest story in America is the great wealth divide, and what we’re doing to make it right!Here’s some good news. The time is right. People everywhere are starting to understand themselves as workers. People all across this country, and around the world, are beginning to see collective action as a solution to our troubles. From Atlanta to Alaska, and everywhere in between, more and more people are talking about economic inequality, people who never spoke those words before. The public is debating big issues, like a living wage and collective bargaining. We’re talking about raising wages, and we like the idea.And I can tell you this, people who like that idea, are going to love the reality of raising wages a whole lot more. You see, household expenditures make up 70% of the American economy. That’s how raising wages will create jobs, because when workers do well, America does well. We buy goods and services to improve our lives. We create demand, and then corporations hire more workers to meet that demand. It’s what you call a virtuous cycle. It’s the opposite of a race to the bottom. It’s the foundation of a strong economy built on raising wages, not credit card debt and asset bubbles.We’re spreading the word. At the AFL-CIO we’ve got a new program called Common Sense Economics. Have you heard of it? We intend to teach 1 million regular working people how raising wages works. That’s just one way we’ll use information to continue to build momentum for working people. We’ve got other initiatives, too. We’re strengthening our state federations of labor and local labor councils. We’re joining together with community partners and allies, in ways we never have before. We’re a mainstream movement, and we’re acting like it.America is tired of losing middle-class jobs. From Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico, from Maine to the California coast, we’re done with the downward spiral. In poll after poll after poll, we hear Americans say, “We want an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy few.”Our values are mainstream values. You see, more than 70% of the American people want minimum wage to go up to $10.10 an hour, and 72% say federal investment in American infrastructure to create jobs should be a top national priority, 82% of the public wants good American manufacturing jobs, not more bad trade deals. That’s an idea that unites us, and 90% of the American people want an end to Chinese currency manipulation, 90%, that’s an idea that unites almost every single one of us! You see, working people may embrace a range of philosophies, religions and political points of view, but we are still united by the circumstances of our lives, and by the vision and the hopes we share.And so it is up to you and me, to each of us, to help bridge the gap for the workers who share our values, but who don’t yet see how our interests come together.That’s why we’re reaching out to all workers, even if they fly the Tea Party flag, I won’t write anybody off, because when it comes to economic issues, we must stand together with anybody who will stand with us, so the voices of America, our America, can be heard in the workplace and in our national life.Working people share a lot more than most people think. In our research, we’ve found what we’re calling Tea Party populists, and we’ll stand with them. Together, we can turn cynicism into stubborn action.Work should never hold us down and trap us in poverty. Work must lift us up. We want our country to work for the people who work!Power and hope are rising.We’re on the right path, brothers and sisters. A groundswell is growing, and it keeps getting bigger. It's strong, and it'll get stronger. It's a movement to raise wages, so all of us can live a better life.We’ll stand together to raise wages for all. We’ll fight for athletes and car wash workers, for Harley workers and security guards, nurses and teachers! We’ll march together! For working families! For good pay. We’ll stand together! For a strong future. For each other! We won’t back down, or back up, or step down, until we win a new day for the American Dream. We’ll shout here in Fairbanks and all across America. And we’ll show how much good raising wages can do.Well, listen, that all sounds good, right? But believe me, I know how hard it is to unite a movement. I know how tough it is to mobilize and motivate a membership as diverse as ours, as broad and strong and varied as the workers of the Alaska AFL-CIO.Yet we can bring ourselves together. We’ve already started, and it’s working. It’s time for us to believe in ourselves again, believe in the power of our movement, believe in the progress that’s possible in our democracy!You see, we’re building power, the hard way. We’ve learned some mean political lessons about the red-blue divide, hard political lessons, but I want you to listen very closely to what I have to say, we’re stronger because of those lessons. We’re more independent because of those lessons. We’re more focused, more disciplined, more creative, and more powerful.We’re asking hard questions of every single candidate who wants our support, we’re asking questions like, do you support America’s workers? Do you support our right to bargain collectively for a better life? Do you support good jobs? Will you grow our economy, not shrink it? Will you raise wages?You see, we’re not working for any candidate. We’re not building power for any political party. Not the Democratic Party. Not the Republican Party. We’re building power for working people, pure and simple. We’re looking at the long view. We’ll work for anybody who works with us, and we’re not afraid of holding anybody’s feet to the fire. Working families need results. Period.Yet I promise, I swear, nobody will work harder, or smarter, or longer, to elect the leaders who make the right commitments, and nobody will work harder, or longer, to defeat those who don’t, regardless of party.Right now, I want you to commit to fighting for Mark Begich to stay in the U.S. Senate. This leader has a 98% AFL-CIO lifetime voting record. He stands with us, let’s stand with him!And if you can win for endorsed candidates in Anchorage, you can rebuild a bipartisan coalition that can work for working families. I know it’s possible. It’s more than possible, but it’s going to take something like 10,000 more votes.And let me tell you, if the Fairbanks city council doesn’t motivate us, I don’t know what will. I read in the paper a few weeks ago that they voted 4-1 to reject the ruling of an arbitrator telling them to pay $60,000 in health care premiums to the city firefighters. That’s unbelievable. Let me tell you, those firefighters put themselves on the line for this city every single day. That’s public service. That’s integrity. But the council members who cast those four votes? They wouldn’t know public service from a hole in the ground. Those council members don’t know a thing about integrity. It’s time for us to put them out of a job.This electoral season, I want you to work like never before. You have to be the leaders who lead by example. Be the first to knock on the doors. Make the first phone call at the phone bank.You’ll motivate your volunteers. You’ll strengthen your activists. You’ll help us all connect with more working-class voters, get more working families to the polls, because if we want the policies we need, if we want fair communities, fair states and a fair country, we need the right leaders in every corner of America. We’ve got to engage and turn out our people.When I say, “our people,” I mean union members and families but also like-minded folks in our neighborhoods and communities.We’re changing lives. We’re scrambling and reaching for a little more hope. We have a vision. And we’re going to make it real, because when all of us pitch in, that’s shared responsibility, shared sacrifice.So get off your seat and on your feet, sisters and brothers. When we stand together, we win together. And we’re gonna win together!We’ll work for it.  We’ll stand for it.  Together.  Each of us. With solidarity. Real solidarity. Where your picket line is my picket line. And my picket line is your picket line. Shoulder to shoulder. Arm-in-arm. All day. Every day. As long as it takes. To win together. Standing together. Fighting together. Voting together. Winning together.Thank you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
377,Trumka to OPCMIA Convention: Our Economy Doesn't Work When Work Doesn't Pay,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-opcmia-convention-our-economy-doesnt-work-when-work-doesnt-pay,8-15-2014,"Thank you, Brother Pat [Finley]. Thank you for your truly overly generous words of introduction. And thank you for inviting me to your convention. I’m honored to join you here. Thank you!Pat, you’re a good union man. And I’m proud to call you my brother.And let me tell you how much I admire your union, your members bring tremendous skill and professionalism to masonry and plaster work and all of your trades. It’s hard work, physically taxing and complicated, but your training is top-of-the-line, and your members earn good pay because first of all, you deliver a quality product every single day, and, just as important, you stand together, so you can bargain effectively for good pay and quality benefits.  It’s been a winning combination for about 150 years, which is quite a long time, and from day one, your union has been especially valuable for veterans. You have helped thousands of veterans build good careers, and I thank you for that. I’ve heard it said—and I believe it’s true—that soldiers fresh from the Civil War joined the ranks of the National Plasters’ Union back in 1864, to learn a skilled trade and to build a better life for themselves and their families. That’s one hell of a fine legacy, a legacy to be proud of.And right now, today, veterans are still finding a home with OPCMIA, through the Helmets to Hardhats program. That’s a modern achievement that matches your past excellence. Thank you for your work for America’s proud veterans.And another thing, sisters and brothers, and that’s the positive employment picture for your members. I’m telling you, it feels good to hear good news. After six long years of layoffs and unemployment, your members are fully employed, and you’re looking for new apprentices. I’ve even heard you’re bringing retired members back onto the job to meet demand. You’ve weathered a hard, hard storm, my friends, and you can hold your heads high.I’d like to mention one other thing, your success has been well-earned. It speaks to your powerful leadership, to the true dedication and skill of your members. It speaks to the honor and commitment your members bring to the job every single day, and I commend you for it. So let’s all stand up and give a round of applause, to your history and your future, a strong future.When we talk about the future of America, sometimes we hear a lot of doom and gloom. But I see a world of opportunity. I see millions of workers who want the benefits of solidarity. The kind of solidarity that built and grew your union.The labor movement has an opportunity, an opening. All over this country, people are talking about economic inequality, people who never spoke the words before. The public is debating big issues, like wages good enough so we can really live. The public is debating collective bargaining. We’re talking about rights on the job. We’re talking about raising wages—and let me tell you something, the same people who like the idea of raising wages, are going to like the reality of raising wages a whole lot more.We know what brings fair pay and rights on the job. We know that the best way to fair pay, is a union contract.The best way to retirement security, is a union contract.The best way to a better tomorrow, so we can give our family a decent life and health care and a good education, it all comes back to a union contract.You see, unionism works. It’s the ticket to the middle class, and that’s not too much to ask, because we’re the workers of America.We built the American middle class once, and we’ll rebuild it again.From the building site to the factory floor, we do it all. We build archways and overpasses. We carry the load and answer the call. We do what it takes, no matter what the cost. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night. We won’t be turned aside. We won’t be faced down, and we will not be denied.Brothers and sisters, we’re all too familiar with the story of the past 40 years. We know how productivity rose while wages froze, which meant virtually all of the wealth created by our constantly growing economy has gone to the richest 1%.And we know, our economy doesn’t work when work doesn’t pay.You see, we’re done with quietly sliding down the downward spiral. I can’t promise we’ll win every fight, but I can promise we’ll fight like hell.When we fight, we win, because our values are mainstream values. You see, 72% of the American people say federal investment in infrastructure to create jobs should be a top national priority. Eighty-two percent of the public wants good American manufacturing jobs, not more bad trade deals. That’s an idea that unites us, and 90% of the American people want an end to Chinese currency manipulation, 90%, that’s an idea that unites almost every single one of us! You see, working people may embrace a range of philosophies, religions and political points of view, but we are still united by the circumstances of our lives, and by the vision and the hopes we share.And so it is up to you and me, to each of us, to help bridge the gap for the workers who share our values, but who don’t yet see how our interests come together. That’s why we’re reaching out to all workers, even if they fly the Tea Party flag, I won’t write anybody off, certainly not the Tea Party populists, because when it comes to economic issues, we must stand together with anybody who will stand with us, so the voices of America, our America, can be heard in the workplace and in our national life.  Together, we can turn cynicism into stubborn action.I want to tell you about one of the polls we did at the AFL-CIO. Recently we asked a group of voters if they agreed with this simple statement: “We need to make sure that all of us, not just the CEOs, get our fair share in our economy.”When we asked those making less than $50,000 a year, two out of three voters agreed, 66% said yes, that’s right, we need to make sure all of us, not just CEOs get our fair share.Here’s the kicker. Guess who we asked in that poll? Registered Republicans. That poll was of voters registered with the Republican Party. Here’s what this means, strong majorities of all working class people, even working-class Republicans, share our values. This means working people of every stripe share the same basic challenges in our work and home lives, and we recognize economics are at the heart of our problems. We may have our differences, but we are united by the circumstances of our lives.The possibility exists for us, once again, to build a consistent bipartisan majority for working family issues. We will stand with leaders who stand for the priorities of working families.Democratic, Republican, Independent, whatever we call ourselves, we are tired of losing middle-class jobs. We’ve been wondering why the deck seems stacked against us. We’re sick of the politicians who keep pushing corporate free trade agreements on us. We’re done with those job-killing corporate hand-outs. Those are the most unpopular things in the country, except among Wall Street executives who want to ship our jobs overseas.Here’s a new one. Now, some corporate CEOs want to forsake America entirely and ship their patriotism overseas. It’s called corporate inversion, and it’s when profitable corporations more or less open a P.O. Box in another country, just so they can call it home, and avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes. It’s un-American. And it’s offensive to patriotic Americans who do our duty and pay our taxes. And it has to stop.
It’s the same old game from the same corporate players. We’re done with that. The rest of us want an end to the politics of cruelty, the politics of poverty, the politics of exclusion, the politics of racism, the politics of do-nothingism. The time is right. The world is changing. The power of the 99% is growing. There is a new story in America. You see, people are starting to understand the connection between good jobs and a strong economy. A powerful majority says our growing inequality is bad for America. And more than 70% of America’s voters support raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. You know, it’s been so long since the minimum wage last went up.  Sarah Palin was still governor of Alaska, that’s true. And the last time the minimum wage went up for tipped workers, was back in 1991, when Bill and Hillary Clinton still lived in Little Rock, Arkansas!We’re going to fight to raise the minimum wage, because work should lift us from poverty, not trap us in it. That’s a popular idea in America today.People are starting to understand how the minimum wage is connected to everybody’s wage, that lifting the wage floor will lift all of us together.It works like this: household expenditures make up 70% of the American economy. That’s how raising wages will create jobs, because when workers do well, America does well. We buy goods and services to improve our lives. We create demand, and then corporations hire more workers to meet that demand. It’s what you call a virtuous cycle. It’s the opposite of a race to the bottom. It’s the foundation of a strong economy built on raising wages, not credit card debt and asset bubbles.This is the new story in America. It’s the story of the great wealth divide, and what we’re doing to fix it. This new story in America didn’t start in Washington, D.C., or in the centers of American power. It didn’t come from Wall Street. It comes from masons, and plasterers, from worksites, and office buildings. It comes from the domestic workers and the day laborers, and the recent college graduates who search for work under a cloud of crushing debt. Working people are standing together again, and thinking about politics in a whole new way. If you remember one thing I say today, remember this: We are fighting for our values, not for candidates or parties.You see, we do not work for any candidate. We are not building power for any political party. Not the Democratic Party. Not the Republican Party.We’re building power for working people, pure and simple. We’re looking at the long view. We’ll work with anyone who will work with us. And we’re not afraid of holding anybody’s feet to the fire. Working families need results. Period.We’re asking hard questions of every candidate who wants our support, and one question we want every candidate to answer is, do you support America’s workers? Do you support our right to bargain collectively for a better life? Will you grow our economy, not shrink it? Will you raise wages?And I promise, I swear, nobody will work harder, or smarter, or longer, to elect the leaders who make the right commitments, and nobody will work harder, or longer, to defeat those who don’t, regardless of political party.This electoral season, I have a big ask for you. I want you to do this with me. I want you to lead with me. I want you to work like never before. Be the leaders who lead by example. Be the first to knock on doors. Be seen at the phone banks. I’ll be doing it, too.We’ll motivate our volunteers. We’ll strengthen our activists. We’ll help each other connect with more working-class voters, get more working families to the polls, because if we want the policies we need, if we want all working people to get a fair share, we need the right leaders in our states and for this country. We’ve got to engage and turn out our people. When I say, “our people,” I mean union members and families but also like-minded folks in our neighborhoods and communities.And here’s the best part, after the polls close on Election Day, we’ll have a stronger network of activists and local leaders, ready to mobilize and pressure our state and national leaders for the policies we need, and we’ll stand ready to support our organizing for the union members of tomorrow.Standing together, working people will change this country, our country!And every family will share the benefit. Every community. We’ll build the future we know we can have, and must have, and will have. Because we believe in the power of America. We believe in the American Dream. We’ll never give up. We’ll never back down. We’ll never say quit. We’ll never say die. We’ll fight ‘til we win!Brothers and sisters, we’re fighting for what’s right, and we intend to win. Power and hope are rising. America’s workers are standing up, standing together. You’ve seen the fast food workers. You’ve supported the Walmart moms.And listen, I’ve heard some people, good people, talk about fast food workers. I’ve heard people say $15 an hour is too much for a burger flipper.Two things about that: Number one, it’s disrespectful. Fast food work is tough, hard work. It’s not shameful—and it deserves the respect all work deserves. Number two, I can remember a day when people said $4.25 an hour was too much for a cement mason! Do any of you remember that?Every job has dignity, and we stand for the ideal that every worker, every single worker, must have a voice on the job, for safety, for respect, for fairness, for good pay and benefits, and for the prospect of a decent retirement.We’ve got a lot of big things to accomplish.We’ve got to work hard through Election Day, and then we’ve got to push for the policies that will build an American economy for the long haul.And I know how hard you work. I know how dedicated you are. And I’ve got to tell you, working people need you again. We need your political action. We need your legislative accountability. We need you for our voter registration drives. We need you for your solidarity. For a better life, for unionism!That’s what we’re about. We’re about changing lives, lifting lives, and scrambling and reaching for a little more hope. We have a vision, and we’re going to make it real, because when all of us pitch in, that’s shared sacrifice. That’s shared responsibility. We do what it takes. We’ll stand together because we’re stronger together.We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.We’ll stand for it. Together. Each of us. With solidarity. Real solidarity. Where your picket line is my picket line. And my picket line is your picket line.We’ll rise together. We’ll march together. We’ll fight side-by-side. We’ll win arm-in-arm. To bring out the best in ourselves. To bring out the best in each other. To bring out the best in America. Together. Standing together. Fighting together. Voting together. Winning together. Winning for America!Thank you. Thank you, and God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
378,Trumka to SMART Delegates: Work Must Lift Us Up,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-smart-delegates-work-must-lift-us,8-14-2014,"Thank you, Brother Joe [Nigro], for your kind words of introduction. Thank you for inviting me to your convention. It’s good to be here with this important, and powerful union, at such a critical point in your history.I want to talk to you about the unity of our movement today, about Democrats and Republicans, about the labor movement’s engagement in the social issues of our day, and about where we stand in the middle of it all, as a labor movement, as working people.First, I’ll say this about your union: A merger like yours isn’t easy. There’s nothing simple about it.On the one hand, your merger has potential for tremendous value: your larger membership means having your voice in more arenas—in organizing and in politics, from city halls all the way to Capitol Hill in Washington.Yet on the other hand, let’s face it, all that positive stuff sounds good, but I know how hard it is to unite a movement. I know how tough it is to mobilize and bring together a membership as diverse as ours, as broad and strong and varied as the workers represented by your union. We’re talking about unions with very different and distinct cultures. We’re talking, in some cases, about workers who have exercised a lot of autonomy in the past, and this merger to some, represents the prospect of giving some of that up.It’s difficult to find the right balance, but it’s worth the effort, because that’s how you’ll achieve greater strength, without losing those traditions that are so dear to us all. And so I commend you for the work you’ve done, and the work you will do. As I said, it may not be easy, but it’s important—the merging of cultures for greater power, greater strength. That’s unionism, pure and simple.Brothers and sisters, just as unionism is so central in our lives, we aim to help more working families use unionism to build a better life. I’m not saying that because I like the sound of the words. I’m saying it because it’s true. Unionism works. Solidarity builds strong careers, strong families, strong communities and a strong future for the United States of America.A union is the best tool to win respect, to turn a bad job into a good job, one with good pay and benefits and a chance for a secure retirement, because when we stand together, we’re powerful. We earn respect. There’s no denying it. Unionism works.The best way to fair pay, is a union contract.The best way to retirement security, is a union contract.The best way to a better tomorrow, so you can give your family a decent life and a strong future, it all comes back to a union contract.And a decent life is not too much to ask, because we’re the workers of America, from the shipyard to the round house, from construction site to the airfield, we build the systems and keep them running. We lift the loads and answer the call. We do what it takes, no matter the cost. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night. We won’t be turned aside. We won’t sit down, or back up, or shut up, and we will not be denied. This is our country, and we’re taking it back. It’s time for America to work for workers!Sisters and brothers, you know the story of the past 40 years as well as anybody. You know how productivity rose while wages froze, which meant virtually all of the wealth created by our growing economy has gone to the richest 1%.As working men and women, we’ve seen the day-by-day toll this trend has taken on workers. We’ve seen how corporations sometimes rig themselves to fail, so executives can break pension promises, and walk away with millions. And we’ve seen profitable companies use the struggles down the street to justify health care cuts and take-back contracts.We’ve seen corporations, profitable and strong corporations, cut corners and take shortcuts for no reason other than to make bigger profits. That puts workers at risk. That’s wrong.Look at the effort to end two-man crews by increasing automation on the railways. I don’t think these executives have been reading the newspapers about derailments, but we need our trains fully staffed.We’re talking about the safety of our communities, the lives of workers. This isn’t up for debate, any more than the idea of flying a commercial airline with only one pilot. Some shortcuts are simply too dangerous!And these proposals come back to one simple thing: the endless pursuit of more money, higher profits, even at the expense of human life.This is the story of the past four decades, as working families have been worn down all over the country. Our entire nation has been worn down, because our economy doesn’t work when work doesn’t pay.But the good news is people everywhere are starting to understand themselves as workers. People all across this country, and around the world, are beginning to see collective action as a solution to our troubles. From the Vatican to Vegas, and everywhere in between, more and more people are talking about economic inequality, people who never spoke the words before. The public is debating big issues, like a living wage and collective bargaining. We’re talking about raising wages, and we like it.And I can tell you this, people who like the idea of raising wages, are going to love the reality of raising wages a whole lot more. You see, household expenditures make up 70% of the American economy. That’s how raising wages will create jobs, because when workers do well, America does well. We buy goods and services to improve our lives. We create demand, and then corporations hire more workers to meet that demand. It’s what you call a virtuous cycle. It’s the opposite of a race to the bottom. It’s the foundation of a strong economy built on raising wages, not credit card debt and asset bubbles.We’re spreading the word. At the AFL-CIO we’ve got a new program called Common Sense Economics. How many of you have heard of it? We have a plan to teach 1 million regular working people how raising wages works. That’s just one way we’ll use information to continue to build momentum for working families. We’ve got other initiatives, too. We’re strengthening our state federations of labor and local labor councils. We’re joining together with community partners and allies, in ways we never have before. We’re a mainstream movement, and we’re acting like it.America is tired of losing middle-class jobs. From Montana to the Gulf of Mexico, and from Oregon to the Florida coast, we’re done with the downward spiral. In poll after poll after poll, we hear Americans say, “We want an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy few.”More than 70% of the American people want minimum wage to go up to $10.10 an hour, and 72% say federal investments in America’s infrastructure to create jobs should be a top national priority.  Eighty-two percent of the public wants good American manufacturing jobs, not more bad trade deals. That’s an idea that unites us, and 90% of the American people want an end to Chinese currency manipulation -- 90%, that’s an idea that unites almost every single one of us!Now let me tell you this: At the AFL-CIO we asked a specific group of voters if they agreed with this simple statement: “We need to make sure that all of us, not just the CEOs get our fair share in our economy.”Two out of three voters agreed -- 66% agreed and said, yes, that’s right, we need to make sure all of us, not just CEOs, get our fair share.Well, you might think that number’s a little low. But you’ll think differently when you hear who we asked. The poll was of registered Republican working class voters. Or as I like to think of them, workers who happen to be Republicans.Here’s what that definition means to me. It means a solid majority of working people of every stripe share our same basic challenges, the same hopes and dreams, and together we understand economics are at the heart of our problems.You see, working people may embrace a range of philosophies, religions and political points of view, but we are still united by the circumstances of our lives, and by the vision and the hopes we share.And so it is up to you and me, to each of us, to help bridge the gap for the workers who share our values, but who don’t yet see how our interests intersect.That’s why we’re reaching out to all workers, even if they fly the Tea Party flag, because when it comes to economic issues, we must all stand together, so the voices of America, our America, can be heard in the workplace and in our national life. And let me tell you, our research shows us that there is a demographic within the self-described Tea Party community, we’ll call them Tea Party liberals, or Tea Party populists, who share our values, who want America to work for the people who work.Work should never hold us down and trap us in poverty. Work must lift us up. We want our country to work for the people who work! And America is on our side!Power and hope are rising. We’re on the right path, brothers and sisters. From sheet metal workers to retail, from domestic workers to day laborers, a groundswell is growing, and it keeps getting bigger. It's strong, and it'll get stronger. It's a movement to raise wages, so all of us can live a better life.We’ll stand together, to raise wages for all. We’ll fight for construction workers and security guards! We’ll march together! For mass transit and power plant workers! For all working families! For good pay. We’ll stand together! For a strong future. For each other! We won’t back down, or back up, or step down, until we win a new day for the American Dream. We’ll shout here in Vegas and all across America. And we’ll show how much good raising wages can do.Brothers and sisters, I began my remarks by talking about the merging of our union cultures, and let me tell you—what you’re doing within your union is pretty similar to what we’re doing all throughout the labor movement.You see, we’re taking a movement of working people and we’re bringing that movement closer to other major social movements of our day. Whether we’re talking about immigration or the movement for marriage equality, some of those same contentious issues arise -- cultural issues.And I know what some people say. They say the AFL-CIO spends too much time and money on social issues. The critics don’t see jobs coming out of it. They don’t see collective bargaining agreements coming out of it.Here’s what I tell them. I say, first off, there’s a rationale for doing this. Our labor movement cannot stand alone. We must have people on our side, and so we’re stepping forward with those allies and partners who share our values, who share our basic interests, because we are more than just an interest group. We are a movement for working people, all working people. That’s what solidarity is all about. Our strength comes from standing together.And second, I tell them this: When we cast our eyes about for partners, we look for those who share our values and our interests.We know, I know, as the son and grandson of immigrants, of workers who were called every name in the book, who were cheated because we didn’t speak the language, who were the last ones hired and the first fired, I know what it’s like to be an immigrant, working hard and searching for a better life, a life where hard work yields rewards, so you can raise your family the way you want, so you can pass a better life onto your children. That dream is the immigrant dream. It’s mine, and yours, too! That dream is the American Dream!You see, we’re not a bunch of bleeding hearts condescending to the latest liberal fad. We are standing together with working people, for working family issues. And if you think about it, immigration policy has always been work policy, ever since the days of chattel slavery. And the worst thing we can ever do as working people is to allow ourselves to be divided along social lines, to be torn apart and beaten up, one by one.We’re standing together with all workers, because we know if working people don’t stand together, we’ll fall together.So that’s why we’re building a movement, a broad movement for the America we want and need. We’re building a movement that will understand the importance of an energy-efficient future of good jobs and a secure economy. We’re building a movement that will understand the importance of Made in America, that will understand the importance of American Made, Union Made.But when it comes to politics, sisters and brothers, you won’t find us joining together with just anybody.You see, we’re not working for just any candidate. We’re not building power for any political party. Not the Democratic Party. Not the Republican Party. We’re building power for working people, pure and simple. We’re looking at the long view. We’ll work for anybody who works with us, and we’re not afraid of holding anybody’s feet to the fire. Working families need results. Period.You see, we’ve learned some mean political lessons about the red-blue divide in the last few year, hard political lessons, but I want you to listen very closely to what I have to say, we’re stronger because of those lessons. We’re more independent because of those lessons. We’re more focused, more disciplined, more creative, and more powerful.We’re asking hard questions of every single candidate who wants our support, we’re asking questions like, do you support America’s workers? Do you support manufacturing jobs? Do you support our right to bargain collectively for a better life? Do you support good jobs? Will you grow our economy, not shrink it? Will you raise wages?And I tell you, we will not hold our nose and line up behind any Democrat, just because there’s a D next to his or her name. That’s not good enough. It won’t happen.Yet I promise, I swear, nobody will work harder, or smarter, or longer, to elect the leaders who make the right commitments, and nobody will work harder, or longer, to defeat those who don’t, regardless of party. And I’m asking you to do this with me.This electoral season, I want to ask you to be leaders who lead by example. Be the first to knock on the doors. Make the first phone call at the phone bank. I’ll do it, too.We have a plan for what we’re doing. We’ll motivate our volunteers. We’ll strengthen our activists. We’ll connect with more working-class voters, get more working families to the polls, because if we want the policies we need, if we want all of us to get our fair share, we need the right leaders in every corner of America. We’ve got to engage and turn out our people. And after Election Day, we’ll have a stronger network of activists and local leaders ready to mobilize and pressure our leaders, and to support our organizing for the union members of tomorrow.We’re changing lives. We’re scrambling and reaching for a little more hope. We have a vision. And we’re going to make it rea, because when all of us pitch in, that’s shared responsibility, shared sacrifice.From Long Island to Long Beach, from the maintenance shed to the factory floor, we win together when we stand together. So get off your seat and on your feet, sisters and brothers. When we stand together, we win together. And we’re gonna win together!We’ll work for it.  We’ll stand for it.  Together.  Each of us. With solidarity. Real solidarity. Where your picket line is my picket line. And my picket line is your picket line. Shoulder to shoulder. Arm-in-arm. All day. Every day. As long as it takes. To win together. To raise wages. To grow together. To bring out the best in ourselves, to bring out the best in each other. To bring out the best in America. For the America we can have, and must have, and will have. Keep fighting. Keep winning.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
379,Trumka to United Steelworkers: Power and Hope are Rising,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-united-steelworkers-power-and-hope-are-rising,8-13-2014,"Thank you, Brother Leo [Gerard], for that kind introduction. Thank you for inviting me to your convention. It’s good to be here with this important, ground-breaking, and powerful union. This is truly, as your theme says, a union that works.I’ve got some good stuff to talk to you about. I want to congratulate you all for being a union that doesn’t give up, that takes a refinery off the chopping block, for instance, and keeps it from closing by finding a new buyer. You’ve got a million examples and each one is incredible in its own way. This is definitely, a union that works.And, I also have some hard subjects to discuss, about the unity of our movement, about Democrats and Republicans, and about where we stand in the middle of it all.First, I want to say, there is no union like the USW. Just the sheer width, and depth, of your membership, sets you apart. So does your activism. Nobody fights as hard against illegal foreign subsidies, Chinese currency manipulation and job exporting as you do. Nobody struggles as hard to save and revitalize American manufacturing as you do. Nobody has presented and won more trade cases than the USW. And year after year you break new ground in your organizing, and I congratulate you, and thank you for all of it.You look at the world with an eye of opportunity, and I appreciate that. You carry on the best traditions of a man I was proud to call my friend and brother, the late Lynn Williams.I want to tell you a story. Back in May of this year, I went to Pittsburgh for the convention of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO. Maybe some of you were there. At the convention, we had a panel with workers who were in the middle of organizing drives.One of those organizing workers was a woman named Rebecca Taksel, who teaches English at Point Park University in Pittsburgh. She’s been an adjunct professor for about 20 years, and she said something to me that I’ve been thinking about ever since. She said she still only earns about 20% of what a tenured faculty member makes. Think about that, 20 years and 20%. She brings in something like $6,700 for the semester. That’s what she lives on. She’s got no job security to speak of. She has developed college courses on her own time and with her own money, only to be told at the last minute, “Sorry! No need for that course after all.”Adjunct teachers like Rebecca Taksel make up a majority of university faculty in the United States—about 75%. And those teachers work hard. Rebecca gives her students a quality education.Rebecca told me she sometimes asks herself, “Why am I doing this?” And this is her reply. She said, “I was trained to do this. I love to do this. I’m a teacher. And I would just like to get a little respect for the work I do. Just a little respect.”Well let me tell you, brothers and sisters, Rebecca is going to get more than just a little respect from me, and from her employer, too, because she and her co-workers at Point Park voted to form a union with AFA-USW this summer, and a union is the best tool to win respect, to turn a bad job into a good job, one with good pay and benefits and a chance for a secure retirement, because when we stand together, we’re powerful. We earn respect. There’s no denying it. It works. Unionism works.Brothers and sisters, we aim to help working families use unionism to build a better life. I’m not saying that because I like the sound of the words. I’m saying it because it’s true. Unionism works. The USW builds strong careers, strong families, strong communities and a strong future for the United States of America.The best way to fair pay, is a union contract.The best way to retirement security, is a union contract.The best way to a better tomorrow, so you can give your family a decent life and a strong future, it all comes back to a union contract.And a decent life is not too much to ask, because we’re the workers of America, from the foundry to the freeway, we forge steel and smelt aluminum. We mine ore and store the slurry. We build turbines and make paper, we bake bread and teach classes. We lift the loads and answer the call. We do what it takes, no matter the cost. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night. We won’t be turned aside. We won’t sit down or back up or shut up. We won’t be faced down, and we will not be denied.Sisters and brothers, in the past few months, I’ve spoken to workers all across the United States.  I don’t get to Canada as much as I’d like, but I’ve talked to Canadian workers, too, and to be perfectly honest with you, the people I talk to are confused and angry, frustrated and scared. They tell me they’re worried about the future. They’re concerned about the life their kids are going to lead. And they’re wondering how, this long after the financial collapse of 2008, sometimes it seems like too little has changed.I want you to know I understand that frustration, fear and confusion. Let’s consider what’s happened over the past 40 years, how productivity rose while wages froze, which meant virtually all of the wealth created by our growing economy has gone to the richest 1%.As union men and women who represent your members, you’ve seen the day-by-day toll this trend has taken on workers. You’ve seen how corporations sometimes rig themselves to fail, so executives can break pension promises, and walk away with millions. And we’ve seen profitable companies use the struggles down the street to justify their own health care cuts and take-back contracts.And when a factory or plant closes, or moves its production to China or somewhere else, all of us have seen the ripple effects move across our communities, from half-empty classrooms and “For Sale” signs in the front yards to restaurant closures and vacant storefronts.And it hits home, doesn’t it? There are fights over finances. Worn out clothes that just have to be worn anyway. Nothing much for the kids at Christmas. Stuff that counts. Stuff that hurts.This is the story of the past 40 years, and it’s been tough on all of us because our economies don’t work when work doesn’t pay.This situation has given workers everywhere a hard-won education in real economics. You see, a lot of people—especially some with college degrees—haven’t thought of themselves as workers. A lot of people didn’t understand the connections between their neighbors and themselves. They didn’t have to, because generations of strong union contracts kept us in pretty good shape. But that’s not the case anymore, and so workers, like Rebecca Taksel up in Pittsburgh, have begun to say things like this: We are going to call ourselves workers, because that’s what we are, and we’re going to change things!Here’s why I’m telling you this: The biggest story in America is the great wealth divide, and what we’re doing to make it right. That’s the new story in America!People everywhere are starting to understand themselves as workers. People all across this country, and around the world, are beginning to see collective action as a solution to our troubles. From fast food to forged steel, and everywhere in between, more and more people talk about economic inequality, people who never spoke the words before. The public is debating big issues, like a living wage and collective bargaining. We’re talking about raising wages, and we like the idea.And I can tell you this, people who like that idea, are going to love the reality of raising wages a whole lot more. You see, household expenditures make up 70% of the American economy. That’s how raising wages will create jobs, because when workers do well, America does well. We buy goods and services to improve our lives. We create demand, and then corporations hire more workers to meet that demand. It’s what you call a virtuous cycle. It’s the opposite of a race to the bottom. It’s the foundation of a strong economy built on raising wages, not credit card debt and asset bubbles.We’re spreading the word. At the AFL-CIO we’ve got a new program called Common Sense Economics. The USW has a similar project. Together we’ll teach 1 million regular working people how raising wages works. We’ll use information to continue to build momentum for working people. We’ve got other initiatives, too. We’re strengthening our state federations of labor and local labor councils. We’re joining together with community partners and allies, in ways we never have before. We’re a mainstream movement, and we’re acting like it.America is tired of losing middle-class jobs. From Montana to the Gulf of Mexico, from Ontario to the California coast, we’re done with the downward spiral. In poll after poll after poll, we hear Americans say, “We want an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy few.”At the AFL-CIO we asked a group of voters if they agreed with this simple statement: “We need to make sure that all of us, not just the CEOs get our fair share in our economy.”When we asked those making less than $50,000 a year, and two out of three voters agreed -- 66% said, yes, that’s right, we need to make sure all of us, not just CEOs get our fair share.Here’s the kicker. Guess who we asked? Registered Republicans. That poll was of voters registered with the Republican Party. Even a majority of conservative working-class Republicans share our values.Here’s what this means to me. It means a solid majority of working people of every stripe share the same basic challenges, the same hopes and dreams, and economics are at the heart of our problems.You see, working people may embrace a range of philosophies, religions and political points of view, but we are still united by the circumstances of our lives, and by the vision and the hopes we share.And so it is up to you and me, to each of us, to help bridge the gap for the workers who share our values, but who don’t yet see how our interests intersect.That’s why we’re reaching out to all workers, even if they fly the Tea Party flag, because when it comes to economic issues, we must all stand together, so the voices of America, our America, can be heard in the workplace and in our national life.Work should never hold us down and trap us in poverty. Work must lift us up. We want our country to work for the people who work!Power and hope are rising.We’re on the right path, brothers and sisters. A groundswell is growing, and it keeps getting bigger. It's strong, and it'll get stronger. It's a movement to raise wages, so all of us can live a better life.We’ll stand together, to raise wages for all. We’ll fight for athletes and car wash workers, for Harley workers and security guards, nurses and teachers! We’ll march together! For working families! For good pay. We’ll stand together! For a strong future. For each other! We won’t back down, or back up, or step down, until we win a new day for the American Dream. We’ll shout here in Vegas and all across America. And we’ll show how much good raising wages can do.Well, listen, that sounds good, but believe me, I know how hard it is to unite a movement. I know how tough it is to mobilize and motivate a membership as diverse as ours, as broad and strong and varied as are the workers of the USW and the AFL-CIO.I’ve talked to workers who say to me, Rich, why don’t we start a labor party? And then they complain about our leaders who haven’t done enough, or the do-nothing right-wingers in Congress who oppose progress and run down our great country, and here’s what I tell them, I say, America has never been more polarized in my lifetime, and that goes the same for some of our members.Here’s what I say, there is no secret formula to carry unionism into every part of this country, to bring together those who have been divided by cynicism and the vain idea that we’re better off alone than together.Yet we can bring ourselves together. We’ve already started, and it’s working. Working people share a lot more than most of us think. In our research, we’ve found what we’re calling Tea Party populists, and we’ll stand with them. Together, we can turn cynicism into stubborn action. It’s time for us to believe in ourselves again, believe in the strength of our movement, believe in the progress that’s possible in our democracy!We all care about the same things -- 82% of the public wants good American manufacturing jobs, not more bad trade deals. That’s an idea that unites us.If Congress won’t take action to support American jobs and end bad trade deals, it’s our responsibility to continue to build a movement, one that cannot be ignored, so we get a Congress that will. The pundits and politicians in Washington have never understood the power of movements. They’re always looking to the past. But we’re the future. Ninety percent of the American people want an end to Chinese currency manipulation; 90%, that’s an idea that unites America.And yet the corporations that benefit from China’s cheap currency still rule the day in Washington. They think their deals cannot be stopped.But we know better. They’re looking to the past. We are the future.We’ll fight from town halls and county commissions to state houses all the way to Capitol Hill! We’ll fight in Ottawa and San Juan, Puerto Rico!Nobody controls our destiny but us. We do! In the history of this world, working people have always had to fight for every single inch.That’s what we’re doing. We’re building power, the hard way. You see, we’ve learned some mean political lessons about the red-blue divide -- hard political lessons, but I want you to listen very closely to what I have to say, we’re stronger because of those lessons. We’re more independent because of those lessons. We’re more focused, more disciplined, more creative, and more powerful.We’re asking hard questions of every single candidate who wants our support, we’re asking questions like, do you support America’s workers? Do you support manufacturing jobs? Do you support our right to bargain collectively for a better life? Do you support good jobs? Will you grow our economy, not shrink it? Will you raise wages? Will you?You see, we’re not working for any candidate. We’re not building power for any political party. Not the Democratic Party. Not the Republican Party. We’re building power for working people, pure and simple. We’re looking at the long view. We’ll work for anybody who works with us, and we’re not afraid of holding anybody’s feet to the fire. Working families need results. Period.And I tell you, we will not hold our nose and line up behind any Democrat, just because there’s a D next to his or her name. That’s not good enough. It won’t happen.Yet I promise, I swear, nobody will work harder, or smarter, or longer, to elect the leaders who make the right commitments, and nobody will work harder, or longer, to defeat those who don’t, regardless of party.This electoral season, I want you to work like never before. Be the leaders who lead by example. Be the first to knock on the doors. Make the first phone call at the phone bank.You’ll motivate your volunteers. You’ll strengthen your activists. You’ll help us all connect with more working-class voters, get more working families to the polls, because if we want the policies we need, if we want all of us to get our fair share, we need the right leaders in every corner of America. We’ve got to engage and turn out our people.When I say, “our people,” I mean union members and families but also like-minded folks in our neighborhoods and communities.After the polls close on Election Day, we’ll have a stronger network of activists and local leaders ready to mobilize and pressure our leaders and support our organizing for the union members of tomorrow.We’re changing lives. We’re scrambling and reaching for a little more hope. We have a vision. And we’re going to make it real, because when all of us pitch in, that’s shared responsibility, shared sacrifice.From the paper mill to the refinery, full-time, part-time, anytime, from the car wash to the tire plant, we win together when we stand together. So get off your seat and on your feet, sisters and brothers. When we stand together, we win together. And we’re gonna win together!We’ll work for it.  We’ll stand for it.  Together.  Each of us. With solidarity. Real solidarity. Where your picket line is my picket line. And my picket line is your picket line. Shoulder to shoulder. Arm-in-arm. All day. Every day. As long as it takes. To win together. To raise wages. To grow together. To bring out the best in ourselves, to bring out the best in each other. To bring out the best in America.

380,"Trunka to Painters Convention: ""We're done with the downward spiral.""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trunka-painters-convention-were-done-downward-spiral,8-12-2014,"Thank you, Ken [Rigmaiden], for your truly over-generous words of introduction. And thank you for your friendship and your solidarity. I’m proud to call you my friend, and I’m glad to call you my brother. Thank you for all you are and all you do.You know, I don’t think there’s any union that fights as well as, or as far above its weight class, as the Painters and Allied Trades. Your strength and power offer a testament to activism, and credibility, because every time the IUPAT says something, you back it up with action.And, let me just say how much I admire the work your members do. I see it every day. Literally. At the AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, we’re wrapping up a major project, a top-to-bottom energy retrofit.We had an outstanding crew of glaziers in there to replace every window in the building, to make the whole place more energy efficient. We had them for the better part of a year, and you’ve never met a more charming group of workers, sometimes colorful, sometimes a bit off-color, wonderful people.That project really brought home to everybody who works at the AFL-CIO headquarters how critical good jobs are, and how important it is for all of us to find every way possible to put people to work, and to strengthen our pension funds with strong investments that create good jobs. We’re not just sitting back, telling bankers to invest their money. We’re doing it, too.Whether your members hang dry wall, apply auto paint or install floor coverings, whatever the job is, the quality of work is always the same, the very best. The Painters and Allied Trades deliver, because of your top-of-the-line training, your innovation, your skill and your tireless work ethic.You did a great job at the AFL-CIO headquarters. I’ve been hearing some other good news about IUPAT. Your hours are increasing. People are getting back to work. We’re not where we need to be, but we’re headed in the right direction, especially if we can convince Congress to start funding American infrastructure on the scale we need, so we can rebuild this great country and get members at work on the bridges and overpasses and pipelines. That’s how we’ll create 30,000 new jobs to get IUPAT numbers up to, and then above, pre-recession levels.We’ve got a long way to go, to turn America around. But the conversation in America is changing. All over this country, people are talking about economic inequality, people who never spoke the words before.The public is debating big issues, like wages good enough so we can really live, and raise a family if we want to. The public is debating collective bargaining. We’re talking about rights on the job.We’ve been wanting this conversation for a long time, and guess what? We’re winning. People like the idea of raising wages.Let me tell you something, it’s not going to be easy, but we’re going to turn the tide, because, you see, we’re all about raising wages. We’re about unionism. We honor the dignity of labor when we stand together, for a share of what we create. That’s how we’ll build a movement big enough to lift up America’s working families, big enough to rebuild the American middle class. We did it once. We’ll do it again.Unionism works. The IUPAT builds strong careers, strong families, strong communities and a strong future for the United States of America.The best way to fair pay, is a union contract.The best way to retirement security, is a union contract.The best way to a better tomorrow, so you can give your family a decent life and health care and a good education, it all comes back to a union contract.And a decent life is not too much to ask, because we’re the workers of America. From the warehouse to the factory floor, we do it all. We paint the bridges and the ships. We carry the load and answer the call. We do what it takes, no matter what the cost. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night. We won’t be turned aside. We won’t be faced down, and we will not be denied.Sisters and brothers, we’re all too familiar with the story of the past 40 years. We know how productivity rose while wages froze, which meant virtually all of the wealth created by our growing economy has gone to the richest 1%.Our economy doesn’t work when work doesn’t pay.Household expenditures make up 70% of the American economy. That’s how raising wages will create jobs, because when we do well, America does well. We buy goods and services to improve our lives. We create demand, and corporations hire more workers to meet that demand. It’s what you call a virtuous cycle. It’s the opposite of a race to the bottom. It’s the foundation of a strong economy built on raising wages, not credit card debt and asset bubbles.America is tired of losing middle-class jobs. We’re done with the downward spiral.People are starting to understand the connection between good jobs and a strong economy. More than 70% of America’s voters support raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.You know, it’s been so long since the minimum wage last went up, that was in 2009, Sarah Palin was still governor of Alaska, that’s true. That’s how long it’s been. And the last time the minimum wage went up for tipped workers, back in 1991, Bill and Hillary Clinton still lived in Little Rock, Arkansas! We’re going to fight to raise the minimum wage, because work should lift us from poverty, not trap us in it.Poll after poll shows a powerful majority says growing inequality is bad for America. At the AFL-CIO, we do polling, too. Recently we asked a group of voters if they agreed with this simple statement: “We need to make sure that all of us, not just the CEOs get our fair share in our economy.”When we asked those making less than $50,000 a year, two out of three voters agreed, 66% said, yes, that’s right, we need to make sure all of us, not just CEOs get our fair share.Here’s the kicker. Guess who we asked? Registered Republicans. That poll was of voters registered with the Republican Party.Here’s what this means. It means a solid majority of working people of every stripe share the same basic challenges, and the same hopes and dreams, and we recognize economics are at the heart of our problems.You see, some of us might have different philosophies, we might look different, or sound different. Or even think differently, but in important ways we share the same values. We all need a job to pay the bills. We are united by the circumstances of our lives.This is where the programs of the Painters and Allied Trades are breaking ground, because you’re building powerful connections between like-minded people. You’re talking to all kinds of people, union members, non-union, never-heard-of-unions. And whether we’re talking about CORE -- Community Organization for Real Economics -- in St. Louis, or about your charitable outreach in places like Baltimore, or your electoral and political work just about everywhere, we’re talking about the same thing, about building power from the ground up, about bringing working people together.You get things done. At IUPAT, your political action is like a well-oiled machine. And now you’re building out your presence all across your communities.I know you brought together in Washington all your local leaders who do grassroots organizing. They work-shopped plans and priorities, then you sent everybody back to tap into your motivated membership, so you could build and grow your spirit of activism even stronger. That’s how unionism works. That’s doing it right.And I want you to know, your caliber of activism is spreading across our entire labor movement. At the AFL-CIO we’re strengthening our state federations of labor and central labor councils. And believe me, that one by itself could completely transform our movement. We’re joining together with allies, in ways we never have before. We’re a mainstream movement, a growing movement, a powerful movement, and we’re acting like it.It’s up to you and me, to each of us, to help make the voices of America, our America, heard in the workplace and in our national life. And we’re doing it.Power and hope are rising.We’re on the right path, brothers and sisters. A groundswell is growing, and it keeps getting bigger. It's strong, and it'll get stronger. This isn’t something we cooked up in Washington, D.C. It didn’t come from Wall Street. We hear it at the mall in conversations between security guards and sales people. We hear it among Walmart workers who connect on Facebook and see how power grows when we stand together. We see it with the postal unions’ boycott of Staples. We saw it on Long Island where rail workers said, we don’t want to strike, but we will if you won’t come to the table.  It's a movement to raise wages, so all of us can live a better life.We’ll stand together to raise wages for all. We’ll fight for painters and day laborers, bakers and security guards, drivers and teachers! We’ll march together! For working families! For good pay. We’ll stand together! For a strong future. For each other! We won’t back down, or back up, or shut up, until we win a new day for the American Dream. We’ll shout here in Florida and all across America. And we’ll show how much good raising wages can do.Sisters and brothers, we have big things to do as a country—put our people back to work, restore our democracy and build 21st century infrastructure.  We’ve got ideas on how to build American manufacturing, to strengthen our communities and build our tax base. We’re going to invest in American jobs, not throw them away.And we want labor law reform, so all workers can stand together to bargain for a better life.Listen, I know when we talk about labor law reform, it brings up a sore subject. Let me tell you something: as labor leaders, we have learned some hard lessons, really hard political lessons.Yet I want you to listen very closely to what I have to say, we’re stronger because of the lessons we’ve learned. We’re more independent because of the lessons we’ve learned. We’re more focused, more disciplined, more creative, and ultimately more powerful because of the lessons we’ve learned.All across our labor movement, we’re looking to fight for our values, not for any political party.You see, we don’t work for candidates. We are not building power for the Democratic Party. Not the Republican Party. We’re building power for working people, pure and simple. We’re looking at the long view. We’ll work with anybody who will work with us. And we’re not afraid of holding anybody’s feet to the fire. Working families need results. Period.And I tell you, we’ve got a long memory, and we will not hold our nose and endorse Democrats, just because they have a D next to their name. That’s not good enough. It won’t happen.We’re looking close and asking hard questions of every candidate who wants our support, and one question we want every candidate to answer is, do you support America’s workers? Do you support our right to bargain collectively for a better life? Will you grow our economy, not shrink it? Will you raise wages?And I promise, I swear, nobody will work harder, or smarter, or longer, to elect the leaders who make the right commitments, and nobody will work harder, or longer, to defeat those who don’t, regardless of political party.This electoral season, I have a big ask for you. I want you to do this with me. I want you to lead with me. I want you to work like never before. Be the leaders who lead by example. Be the first to knock on doors. Make the first call at the phone banks. I’ll be doing it, too.We’ll motivate our volunteers. We’ll strengthen our activists. We’ll help each other connect with more working-class voters, get more working families to the polls, because if we want the policies we need, if we want all of us to get our fair share, we need the right leaders in our states and for this country. We’ve got to engage and turn out our people.When I say, “our people,” I mean union members and families but also like-minded folks in our neighborhoods and communities.And here’s the best part, after the polls close on Election Day, we’ll have a stronger network of activists and local leaders, ready to mobilize and pressure our local, state and national leaders for the policies we need, and we’ll stand ready to support our organizing for the union members of tomorrow.Standing together, working people will change this country, our country, America the beautiful!We’re lifting up lives. We won’t settle for less. We want a bold future, and that’s what we’ll get. We’re scrambling and reaching for a little more hope. We have a vision. And we’re going to make it real, because when all of us pitch in, that’s shared responsibility, shared sacrifice. We do what it takes.What we want is simple. It’s what everybody wants, the chance to work hard for a decent life, and to give a better life to our kids. We’ll stand together, because we’re strong together.We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  We’ll stand for it.  Together.  Each of us. Painters with teachers. Letter carriers with hotel workers. Taxi drivers with mine workers. With solidarity. Real solidarity. Where your picket line is my picket line. And my picket line is your picket line. Shoulder to shoulder. Arm-in-arm. All day. Every day. As long as it takes. To win together. To raise wages. To grow together. To bring out the best in ourselves, to bring out the best in each other. To bring out the best in America. For the America we can have, and must have, and will have. Keep fighting. Keep winning.Thank you. Thank you, and God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
381,"Trumka to BCTGM: ""I'm ready to fight!""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-bctgm-im-ready-fight,8-6-2014,"Thank you!And thank you, David [Durkee], for that truly warm and generous introduction.  I’ll do my best to live up to it. And thank you for including me in your convention. It’s an honor to be with the BCTGM, and I’m glad to be with you here in Las Vegas.Now, let me ask you something. where’s Frank [Hurt]?Brothers and sisters, you know as well as I do how little Frank Hurt likes fanfare, but he’s not president anymore, so I’m gonna say what I’m gonna say.Frank Hurt is a very special guy, and the amount of respect I have for him is tremendous. He has always been a solid trade unionist, to his core. He never forgot where he comes from -- he comes from a mining family in West Virginia. My father was a miner, and so was Frank’s. My father, bless his memory, died of black lung from breathing all that coal dust. Frank’s father, may God rest his soul, didn’t make it that far. He died from injuries on the job, when Frank was just a young kid.As you all know, Frank and I worked together for years. We have always had an excellent and supportive relationship, but more than that, we’re friends. We like each other.Frank, I want everybody to hear me say this: You’re my brother. Thank you for all you are and all you do. For you, I feel an ocean of admiration and love. Your legacy will endure, and we are all, each and every one of us, better off because of it. Thank you.My friends, please join me in a round of applause for Frank Hurt!Brother David, you’ve got some big shoes to fill, but you’ve done a great job so far. And let me promise you this, whatever BCTGM needs, anything at all, all you’ve got to do is say the word; the hard-working men and women of the AFL-CIO stand ready to deliver.Listen, it’s been a rough couple years, for workers, for our unions, and for all of us.And yet, the tide is changing. All over this country, people are talking about economic inequality, people who never spoke the words before. The public is debating big issues, like a living wage and collective bargaining. We’re talking about rights on the job.We’ve been wanting this conversation for a long time, and guess what? We’re winning. People like the idea of raising wages.That’s how we’ll keep turning the tide, you see, we’re all about raising wages. That’s how we’ll build a movement big enough to lift up America’s working families.That’s how we’ll build a movement powerful enough raise local, regional and national standards. We’ll start by winning good contracts at all the former Hostess plants in places like Billings and Indianapolis, and so many other cities and towns. We’ll start by building powerful community partnerships like the one that’s growing fast in Memphis, Tennessee, and I want to congratulate you on that coalition in particular. That’s the future of American labor. That’s how we will win against all the money and power of Wall Street and corporate greed, because nothing beats people power!  Nobody is going to tear us down. We’re going to lift America up. We’re going to lift America up with union contracts! We’re going to lift America up by raising wages!Brothers and sisters, we’re going to help working families use unionism to build a better life. I’m not saying that because I like the sound of the words. I’m saying it because it’s true. Unionism works. BCTGM builds strong careers, strong families, strong communities and a strong future for the United States of America.The best way to fair pay, is a union contract.The best way to retirement security, is a union contract.The best way to a better tomorrow, so you can give your family a decent life and health care and a good education, it all comes back to a union contract.And a decent life is not too much to ask, because we’re the workers of America. We mill the grain and bake the bread. We work in factories and on the highways. We lift the loads and answer the call. We do what it takes, no matter what the cost. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night. We won’t be turned aside. We won’t be faced down, and we will not be denied.Sisters and brothers, we’re all too familiar with the story of the past 40 years. We know how productivity rose while wages froze, which meant virtually all of the wealth created by our constantly growing economy has gone to the richest 1%.Our economy doesn’t work when work doesn’t pay.Household expenditures make up 70% of the American economy. That’s how raising wages will create jobs, because when we do well, America does well. We buy goods and services to improve our lives. We create demand, and corporations hire more workers to meet that demand. It’s what you call a virtuous cycle. It’s the opposite of a race to the bottom. It’s the foundation of a strong economy built on raising wages, not credit card debt and asset bubbles.At the AFL-CIO we’ve got a new program called Common Sense Economics to teach 1 million regular working people how raising wages works. That’s just one way we’ll turn things around by building power for working people, with information. We’ve got other initiatives, too. We’re strengthening our state federations of labor and CLCs. We’re joining together with allies, in ways we never have before. We’re a mainstream movement, and we’re acting like it.All across this country, short-sighted executives are following the same model. They’re trying to tear down working people. Here’s what they say, “Do more with less. Work more. Bake more. Clean more. Stock more. Haul more.” And here’s what they offer in return: Less money. Worse benefits. No retirement security. And about that work schedule, you gotta be flexible. We don’t, but you do.We’ve seen lockouts like never before, all through America’s breadbasket, from California to North Dakota, Iowa to Oregon, and from Minnesota down to Tennessee.We’ve seen quality companies snapped up by private equity with one goal, to squeeze every available penny and then dump what’s left into bankruptcy for a fire sale. They’re happy to do it. And guess who loses? Workers and retirees. And families and communities. And America.What do you think of that? I think it stinks.Here’s what I think: I’m ready to fight!I’m ready to make a difference, and I’ll tell you something: the American people have begun to understand the connection between good jobs and a strong economy. Good jobs at the bakery, good jobs at the mill, good jobs at the plant, all those good jobs support local businesses. Our neighbors and friends understand that basic idea, and we’re spreading the word.America is tired of losing middle-class jobs. We’re done with the downward spiral. In poll after poll after poll, we hear Americans say, “We want an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy few.”The AFL-CIO does our own polling. Recently we asked a group of voters if they agreed with this simple statement: “We need to make sure that all of us, not just the CEOs get our fair share in our economy.”When we asked those making less than $50,000 a year, and two out of three voters agreed. Sixty-six percent said, yes, that’s right, we need to make sure all of us, not just CEOs get our fair share.Here’s the kicker. Guess who we asked? Registered Republicans. That poll was of voters registered with the Republican Party.Here’s what this means to me. It means a solid majority of working people of every stripe share the same basic challenges, and the same hopes and dreams, and we recognize economics are at the heart of our problems.Last year, I met some Panera workers, who came to DC. We were in the middle of the fight to have a full National Labor Relations Board, and let me tell you, you were terrific in that fight, but you know what? Those workers and I never talked political parties. It didn’t come up. I never thought about it, to be honest, because those workers deserve to have their rights respected on the job. Democrat. Republican. What-have-you.That’s one of the beautiful things that connects us in the labor movement. We all work. We all need work to pay. We are united by the circumstances of our lives, and by the vision and the hopes we share.We’re not done standing with the Panera workers. And we’re not done standing with any of the workers who are rising up, coast to coast, union and non-union, fast food workers, tobacco workers, taxi workers, domestic workers.It’s happening. It’s growing. This isn’t something we cooked up in Washington, D.C. It didn’t come from Wall Street. It’s growing in Memphis. It is rising with the postal unions’ boycott of Staples. It rose on Long Island where rail workers said, we don’t want to strike, but we will if you won’t come to the table.It is rising up from the hotels and casinos right here in Las Vegas.And it is up to you and me, to each of us, to help make the voices of America, our America, heard in the workplace and in our national life. Work should never hold us down and trap us in poverty. Work must lift us up. We want our country to work for the people who work!Power and hope are rising.We’re on the right path, brothers and sisters. A groundswell is growing, and it keeps getting bigger. It's strong, and it'll get stronger. It's a movement to raise wages, so all of us can live a better life.We’ll stand together, to raise wages for all. We’ll fight for farm workers and day laborers, bakers and security guards, drivers and teachers! We’ll march together! For working families! For good pay. We’ll stand together! For a strong future. For each other! We won’t back down, or back up, or shut up, until we win a new day for the American Dream. We’ll shout here in Vegas and all across America. And we’ll show how much good raising wages can do.Sisters and brothers, we have big things to do as a country—put our people back to work, restore our democracy and build 21st century infrastructure. We’re going to strengthen and grow American jobs, not throw them away.We know what America needs.  We’ve got proposals to fix what’s broken, like raising the minimum wage, like bankruptcy reform to protect workers and retirees instead of Wall Street bankers. These are popular mainstream ideas.  More than 70% of America’s voters support raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.  Sixty-five percent of the U.S. public say the gap between the richest and the rest of us has gotten worse over the past decade, and the same percentage says our growing inequality is bad for America.We’re putting forward majority ideas when we propose ways to hold corporations accountable, especially the ones that are deserting our country to avoid paying taxes but still expect full American corporate benefits. It’s gotten so bad that even Fortune Magazine—which is about as pro-business as you can get—calls these tax-dodgers—and I quote—“un-American.”We can fix that, with the right leaders.And we can make a difference for millions of retail and service workers by turning the new bill from Reps. Rosa DeLauro and George Miller, called Schedules that Work, into law.And we’re going to fight to raise the minimum wage. You know, it’s been so long since the minimum wage last went up.  Sarah Palin was still governor of Alaska, that’s true. And the last time the minimum wage went up for tipped workers, was back in 1991, when Bill and Hillary Clinton still lived in Little Rock, Arkansas! We’re going to fight to raise the minimum wage, because work should lift us out of poverty, not trap us in it.But that’s not all we want. We want labor law reform.I promise you, labor leaders have learned some hard lessons, really hard political lessons, over the past five years. Yet I want you to listen very closely to what I have to say, we’re stronger because of the lessons we’ve learned. We’re more independent because of the lessons we’ve learned. We’re more focused, more disciplined, more creative and more powerful because of the lessons we’ve learned.We’re putting those lessons to use. This electoral season, I want you to work like never before. Be the leaders who lead by example. Be the first to knock on doors. Make the first call at the phone banks. You’ll motivate your volunteers. You’ll strengthen your activists. You’ll help us all connect with more working-class voters, get more working families to the polls, because if we want the policies we need, if we want all of us to get our fair share, we need the right leaders in every corner of America. We’ve got to engage and turn out our people.When I say, “our people,” I mean union members and families but also like-minded folks in our communities.But don’t get me wrong. We are not working for any candidate. We are not building power for any political party. Not the Democratic Party. Not the Republican Party. We’re building power for working people, pure and simple. We’re looking at the long view. And we’re not afraid of holding anybody’s feet to the fire. Working families need results. Period.Yet I promise, I swear, nobody will work harder, or smarter, or longer, to elect the leaders who make the right commitments, and nobody will work harder, or longer, to defeat those who don’t, regardless of political party. And I tell you, we’ve got a long memory, and we will not hold our nose and endorse Democrats, just because they have a D next to their name. That’s not good enough. It won’t happen.We’re asking hard questions of every candidate who wants our support, and one question we want every candidate to answer is, do you support America’s workers? Do you support our right to bargain collectively for a better life? Do you believe in American manufacturing? Will you grow our economy, not shrink it? Will you raise wages?Standing together, working people will change this country.Listen, I know how hard you work. I know how dedicated you are. I know your political activism, and I know your community activism. Keep it up. Keep growing. Keep reaching out.We’re changing lives. We’re scrambling and reaching for a little more hope. We have a vision. And we’re going to make it real, because when all of us pitch in, that’s shared responsibility, shared sacrifice. We do what it takes.What we want is simple. It’s what everybody wants, the chance to work hard for a decent life, and to give a better life to our kids. We’ll stand together, because we’re strong together.We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  We’ll stand for it.  Together.  Each of us. With solidarity. Real solidarity. Where your picket line is my picket line. And my picket line is your picket line. Shoulder to shoulder. Arm-in-arm. All day. Every day. As long as it takes. To win together. To raise wages. To grow together. To bring out the best in ourselves, to bring out the best in each other. To bring out the best in America. For the America we can have, and must have, and will have. Keep fighting. Keep winning.Thank you. Thank you, and God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
382,Trumka to RWDSU Delegates: Unionism Works,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-rwdsu-delegates-unionism-works,8-5-2014,"Thank you, Stuart [Appelbaum], for your truly over-generous introduction.  And thank you for your friendship and your solidarity.  I’m proud to call you my friend, and I’m glad to call you my brother.  Thank you for all you are and all you do.Four years ago, you held your last convention here in Florida.  I was not able to attend, but not for lack of trying, I can promise you that.  I did record a video expressing my great support for the strike at the Motts plant in upstate New York.It was a powerful strike, and it achieved important immediate goals—goals relating to maintain-ing good wages, benefits and retirement security.Yet it achieved another, larger goal as well.  Our brothers and sisters took a long stand in Williamson, New York, to stop the managers of a profitable plant who sought to slash wages just because they could, because of high unemployment from the recession.Our brothers and sisters took a stand against those who tried to take our dignity and turn us into commodities.  The executives at Motts actually used those words.  They said workers are a commodity, just like soybeans or oil.  They said when the price of a commodity goes down, like when unemployment is high, wages should go down.That’s wrong.  That’s ugly.  We are not a commodity.  We’re a community.  We’re working people, who do our jobs, who raise our families, who love our country, who built the American middle class with our own hands, by creating wealth for those corporate executives.  We do all these things, and we will not allow ourselves to be used up and spat out.  We’re not soybeans. We’re human beings.And that’s one thing I love about RWDSU, you work hard every single day for the dignity of regular working people, and I appreciate it.  I know about your organizing.  I know how well you engage your communities.  I know your work for immigration reform.  I know about the Retail Action Project, how you talk to all workers about life on the job, and how to make it better. That’s powerful.  That’s visionary. And let me tell you this: The fight for against Bain Capital and Ares Management for fair pay and decent health care for the Guitar Center workers is what the labor movement is all about. I’ve been following that fight, and the dirty tactics of Bain and Ares have been shameful and ugly. I want every Guitar Center worker to know the entire AFL-CIO and every one of our affiliates stands behind them in their efforts to win a fair contract! We’re going to fight, and we’re going to win!Listen, workers everywhere are tired of feeling like we’re just a commodity, expendable, replaceable. The conversation in America is changing.  All over this country, people are talking about economic inequality, people who never spoke the words before.  The public is debating big issues, like wages good enough so we can really live, and raise a family if we want to.  The public is debating collective bargaining.  We’re talking about rights on the job.We’ve been wanting this conversation for a long time, and guess what?  We’re winning.  People like the idea of raising wages.We’re going to turn the tide, because, you see, we’re all about raising wages.  We honor the dignity of labor by standing together, for a share of what we create.  And that’s how we’ll build a movement big enough to lift up America’s working families, big enough to rebuild the American middle class.  We did it once.  We’ll do it again.Unionism works.  RWDSU builds strong careers, strong families, strong communities and a strong future for the United States of America.The best way to fair pay, is a union contract.The best way to retirement security, is a union contract.The best way to a better tomorrow, so you can give your family a decent life and health care and a good education, it all comes back to a union contract.And a decent life is not too much to ask, because we’re the workers of America.  From the warehouse to the hothouse, we do it all.  We work in factories and on the highways.  We package meat and sell it, too.  We lift the loads and answer the call.  We do what it takes, no matter what the cost.  We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night.  We won’t be turned aside.  We won’t be faced down, and we will not be denied.Sisters and brothers, we’re all too familiar with the story of the past 40 years.

Programs like this and the Retail Action Project will help turn things around by building power for working people, with information. We’ve got other initiatives, too.  We’re strengthening our state federations of labor and central labor councils.  And believe me, that one by itself could completely transform our movement. We’re joining together with allies, in ways we never have before.  We’re a mainstream move-ment, a growing movement, a powerful movement, and we’re acting like it.We’re crystal clear about what we stand for, and what we stand against.  We stand against anything and everything that hurts working people, that endangers us and our families, that makes our lives harder.  All across this country, short-sighted executives are bent on profit at all cost.  Here’s what they say: “Do more with less.”  Here’s what they say: “Work more.  Cook more.  Clean more.  Stock more.  Sell more.”And here’s what they offer in return: Less money.  Worse benefits.  No retirement security.  And about that work schedule, you gotta be flexible.  We don’t, but you do.Does it sound familiar?  What do you think?I think it stinks.I think we’re ready to fight!  And one way is by supporting the Schedules That Work Act from Representatives Rosa Delauro and George Miller in the U.S. House.You see, we’re ready to make a difference, and the rest of America is, too.  People understand the connection between good jobs and a strong economy.  Good jobs at the factory, good jobs at the mall, good jobs at the Motts plant, good jobs at Tysons, good jobs in Georgia, Florida, New York, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia, Massachusetts—all those good jobs support local businesses.America is tired of losing middle-class jobs.  We’re done with the downward spiral.  In poll after poll after poll, we hear Americans say, “We want an economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy few.”At AFL-CIO, we do polls, too.

It means a solid majority of working people of every stripe share the same basic challenges, and the same hopes and dreams, and we recognize economics are at the heart of our problems.That’s one of the beautiful things that connects all working people.  We all need a job to pay the bills.  We are united together by the circumstances of our lives.This is where RWDSU organizing and outreach among car wash workers, and at processing plants, and in retail is breaking ground.  The car wash work in particular is difficult. There’s no two ways about it. But it’s good work. It’s essential work. You’re not just talking dues and sample contracts. You’re experimenting with new ways to organize, reaching out to immigrants, reaching out to nontraditional workers.  You’re digging deep into the community.  You’re joining together with like-minded allies.  You’re building powerful alliances.  Other unions are on the same path.  This is the definition of a growing movement -- gaining momentum.This isn’t something we cooked up in Washington, D.C.  It didn’t come from Wall Street.  It’s rising in conversations on the bus between security guards and sales people at the mall.  It is growing among crossing guard workers, and at Subway restaurants in truck stops, and among Walmart workers who connect on Facebook and see how power grows when we stand together. It is rising with the postal unions’ boycott of Staples.  It rose on Long Island where rail workers said, we don’t want to strike, but we will if you won’t come to the table.And it is up to you and me, to each of us, to help make the voices of America, our America, heard in the workplace and in our national life.

These are popular mainstream ideas, bipartisan ideas.  More than 70% of voters want immigration reform, including most Republicans.  More than 70% of America’s voters support raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.

Let me tell you this: labor leaders have learned some hard lessons, really hard political lessons.

Will you raise wages?And I promise, I swear, nobody will work harder, or smarter, or longer, to elect the leaders who make the right commitments, and nobody will work harder, or longer, to defeat those who don’t, regardless of political party.This electoral season, I want you to work like never before.

We’re scrambling and reaching for a little more hope.  We have a vision. And we’re going to make it real, because when all of us pitch in, that’s shared responsibility, shared sacrifice.

383,Trumka to Transportation Communications Workers: Solidarity Works,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-transportation-communications-workers-solidarity-works,7-23-2014,"Thank you, Bob [Scardelletti], my old friend.  Thank you for your warm words and generous sentiment.  I couldn’t say exactly how long we’ve known each other, but it’s been quite a long while.  I can tell you this: I appreciate you.  You’re a down-to-earth union man, focused on your members.  And you’re effective.  Thank you, Bob, for who you are and what you do.Brothers and sisters, it’s good to be with you.  It’s good to see a union that’s doing so well. You’ve got great contracts, great benefits, great retirement.  Every worker in America should have it so good, and, let me tell you, we’ve got something like that in mind.You see, I’d like all of America to share the goal of lifting all people up, rather than allowing ourselves to be divided.Does someone need retirement security?  We’ll stand with them until they get it.  Does someone need fair pay and good benefits?  We’ll show them how to build a union to bargain collectively for what they need.It’s not rocket science.  It’s unionism.  It’s the American way.  And it works.That’s the message we’re spreading all across this great country.Unions build strong careers, strong families, strong communities and a strong future for the United States of America.The best way to fair pay, is a union contract.The best way to retirement security, is a union contract.The best way to a better tomorrow, so you can give your family a decent life and health care and a good education, it all comes back to a union contract.And a decent life is not too much to ask, because we’re the workers of America.  We haul the loads and ship by rail.  We build the roads and bridges.  We drive the trucks and answer the call. We do what it takes, no matter what the cost.  We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night.  We won’t be turned aside.  We won’t be faced down, and we will not be denied.Sisters and brothers, we’re all too familiar with the story of the past 40 years, and how tough things have been for the majority of working families from coast to coast.  We know that productivity rose while wages froze, which means virtually all of the wealth created by our hard work has gone to the richest 1%.Our economy doesn’t work when work doesn’t pay.Household expenditures make up 70% of the American economy.  That’s why working people are the real job creators—because when we do well, we buy goods and services to improve our lives. And when we spend, we create demand, and corporations hire workers to meet that demand.  It’s what you call a virtuous cycle.  It’s the opposite of a race to the bottom.  It’s the foundation of a strong economy built on real wages, not credit card debt and asset bubbles.At the AFL-CIO we’ve got a new program called Common Sense Economics to teach 1 million regular working people how our economy should work.  That’s just one way we’ll turn things around by building power for working people.  We’ve got other initiatives, too.  We’re strengthening our state federations of labor and CLCs.  We’re joining together with allies, in ways we never have before.  We’re a mainstream movement, and we’re acting like it.Now I know the TCU hasn’t suffered from the off-shoring and outsourcing of American jobs, not like the Machinists and other manufacturing unions, but the truth is we’re all connected, and, as your president says, if corporate CEOs could figure out a way to send your jobs to China, it would happen in a heartbeat.  So we’re banding together with industry and anyone else who will join us to support American manufacturing from the ground up.You see, America is tired of losing middle-class jobs.  We don’t like it.  We’re done with the downward spiral.  We don’t want it anymore.The AFL-CIO did a poll recently.  We asked a group of voters if they agreed with this simple statement: “We need to make sure that all of us, not just the CEOs, get our fair share in our economy.”When we asked those making less than $50,000 a year, two out of three voters agreed -- 66% said, yes, that’s right, we need to make sure all of us, not just CEOs, get our fair share.Here’s the kicker.  Guess who we asked?  Registered Republicans.  That poll was of voters registered with the Republican Party.What this means to me is that working people of every stripe share the same basic challenges, and the same hopes and dreams.  That’s why we’re educating, mobilizing and organizing these workers on a national scale.  And that’s why it makes sense for you to partner with House Republicans when your interests coincide.You see, we’re not working for any candidate.  We’re not building power for any political party. Not the Democratic Party.  Not the Republican Party.  We’re building power for working people, pure and simple.  We’re looking at the long view.Yet I promise, nobody will work harder, or smarter, to elect the leaders who make the right commitments, and nobody will work harder or longer, to defeat those who don’t, regardless of political party.  We’re not going to hold our nose and endorse Democrats, just because they have a D next to their name.  That’s not good enough.America needs leaders who will support the priorities of working people.Brothers and sisters, we have big things to do as a country—put our people back to work, raise wages, restore our democracy and build 21st century infrastructure.  We’re building power from the ground up, and we’re taking it one day at a time.  We don’t have to accomplish everything at once.We can take the time to do it right, because we know, the American people need what we have to offer.  America needs solidarity.Brothers and sisters, from the Vatican to the Moral Mondays in North Carolina, people want an end to the politics of cruelty, the politics of poverty, the politics of exclusion.The time is right.  The world is changing.  America is changing.  The power of the 99% is growing.  This is the new story in America.This new national storyline did not start in Washington, D.C., or in the centers of American power.  It didn’t come from Wall Street.  One hundred and fifteen years ago it rose from the rail yards and depots.  It came from the mines and mills.  It rose from factories and warehouses, and today it is rising up from the hotels and casinos, the fast food restaurants and the taxi stands and from the early bus, when the domestic workers travel across town together for a day’s work.  It comes from the Facebook pages, where Walmart workers meet and learn how much they have in common, and how strong they are together.  It comes from the college graduates trying to find jobs under crushing debt, and from those earning our terribly low, low minimum wage.And it is up to you and me -- to each of us -- to help make the voices of America, our America, heard in the workplace and in our national life. Work should never hold workers down and trap us in poverty.  Work must lift us up.  We want our country to work for the people who work!Power and hope are rising, sisters and brothers.Power and hope are rising.  It’s truly a groundswell, in the words of the great poet Maya Angelou, who died just a few short weeks ago:“Still I rise.Just like moons and like suns,With the certainty of tides,Just like hopes springing high,Still I rise.You may trod me in the very dirt …You may trod me in the very dirt …but still, like dust, I rise.”This fall, when you go into negotiations, think about this: We’re building power.Workers all across America are stepping forward. All across this country, our political programs are swinging into action. We’re knocking on doors. We’re getting to the phone banks. We’re choosing our targets. We’re registering our voters. We’re building power.Because I don’t care how well you speak, or how convincing your argument, when you’ve got political power, our issues suddenly grow legs.  All of a sudden, our issues start to move forward.  It’s amazing.I want to see a lot more of that.  We’ve only had a taste.  But to get it, we’ve got a lot of work to do between now and November, and after.Listen, I know how hard you work.  I know how dedicated you are.  Working people need you again.  We need your political action, we need your mobilization, we need it to show working people everywhere we can stand together, in solidarity, for a better life.  It works.It’s about changing our lives, and scrambling and reaching for a little more hope.  We have a vision.  And we’re going to make it real, because when all of us pitch in, that’s shared responsibility, shared sacrifice.  We do what it takes.What we want is simple.  It’s what everybody wants, the chance to work hard for a decent life, for health care, for a secure retirement, and to give a better life to our kids.  We’ll stand together, because we’re stronger together.We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  We’ll stand for it.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity. Real solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line.  And my picket line is your picket line. And we’ll stand together.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm in arm.  All day.  Every day.  As long as it takes.  To win together.  Because we’re going to win together.  Grow together.  To bring out the best in ourselves, to bring out the best in America.Thank you.  Thank you.  Have a great convention.  And God bless you!

384,"At APWU Convention, Trumka Pledges to Fight for Saturday Delivery",https://aflcio.org/speeches/apwu-convention-trumka-pledges-fight-saturday-delivery,7-22-2014,"Thank you!And thank you, Mark [Dimondstein],for that truly warm introduction, and for including me in your convention. It’s an honor to be with the American Postal Workers Union. It’s wonderful to be in Chicago, with you.First, I want you to know I’ve been following your growing activism, and I think it’s smart. In particular, I like the fact that you’re moving ideas that Post Office can put into effect today.  You’re not waiting on Congress to fix the U.S. Postal Service.  You’ve got new leadership, and you’re taking full advantage of the energy and enthusiasm of your leaders to see what all of us can do, what positive changes we can make.Second, I want to acknowledge the APWU for your important work in helping to pull together the historic alliance of the four postal unions. None of us should miss the significance of this coalition. It’s a big deal, because it could very well change the dynamic of the U.S. Postal Service, and it’s part and parcel of the growing activism of workers across America.And I want say something about the work your members do every day. You moved almost 160 billion pieces of mail last year, including 66 billion letters and other first-class mail. Most of your work is never seen by the public. Most people have no idea what you do. But we feel it. We depend on it. You provide a critical service, absolutely critical. You embody professionalism, in public service. Thank you.The American public trusts our Post Office because you always deliver. Year after year after year, the headline is the same: “The United States Postal Service once again finds itself at the top of the list of most trusted federal agencies.” That’s a real quote from a national survey.I’ve got something else to tell you, get ready for this, the American public doesn’t trust Staples like we trust you. It’s not the same. Stop Staples!There’s still a boycott. Staples can’t dodge this one. The battle continues. Staples hasn’t changed. We haven’t changed.Let’s be perfectly clear. You heard me! Don’t Buy Staples!We will not stand by and let the Postal Service privatize America’s most trusted institution.Stop Staples is a powerful campaign. You’ve done the groundwork. You’ve built a winning campaign, and it’s gaining steam. The momentum is growing. Unions are stepping forward to stand at your side, and people all over the place are talking about it.You’re building a coalition, and it’s getting bigger.You’re raising your voices, and it’s getting louder!You stand together to defend the institution we love, and when you do, you show America what unionism is!Brothers and sisters, we’re going to help working families use unionism to build a better life. I’m not saying that because I like the sound of the words. I’m saying it because it’s true. Unionism works. The APWU builds strong careers, strong families, strong communities and a strong future for the United States of America.The best way to fair pay, is a union contract.The best way to retirement security, is a union contract.The best way to a better tomorrow, so you can give your family a decent life and health care and a good education, it all comes back to a union contract.And a decent life is not too much to ask, because we’re the workers of America. We sort the loads and ship the mail. We build the roads and bridges. We drive the trucks and answer the call. We do what it takes, no matter what the cost. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night. We won’t be turned aside. We won’t be faced down, and we will not be denied.Sisters and brothers, we’re all too familiar with the story of the past 40 years. We know how productivity rose while wages froze, which meant virtually all of the wealth created by our constantly climbing productivity has gone to the richest 1%.Our economy doesn’t work when work doesn’t pay.Household expenditures make up 70 percent of the American economy. That’s how working people are the real job creators, because when we do well, we buy goods and services to improve our lives. And when we spend, we create demand, and corporations hire workers to meet that demand. It’s what you call a virtuous cycle. It’s the opposite of a race to the bottom. It’s the foundation of a strong economy built on real wages, not credit card debt and asset bubbles.At the AFL-CIO we’ve got a new program called Common Sense Economics to teach 1 million regular working people how our economy should work. That’s just one way we’ll turn things around by building power for working people. We’ve got other initiatives, too. We’re strengthening our state federations of labor and CLCs. We’re joining together with allies, in ways we never have before. We’re a mainstream movement, and we’re acting like it.We’re building power every way we can. We’re supporting workers who organize in new ways. We’re mobilizing with new energy. We’re supporting change at the local level, and the state level. And we’re strengthening our electoral campaigns at the federal level.We’re fighting back against the planned closures of 82 processing plants. Honestly, these closures are about the dumbest thing I ever heard. I’m tired of postal service leaders who want nothing more than postal service destruction.I don’t like him, but I know what makes Rep. Darrell Issa tick. He has a right to his opinion. He has an ideological problem with the U.S. Postal Service. You can sum up all his ideas in one word: privatize. But what I don’t understand is how someone can take a job like U.S. Postmaster General without embracing a strong and positive vision of the service you provide.For one thing, the postal service earned an operating profit last year, so it’s a struggle to argue for major changes. For another, if you contend—as Patrick Donahoe does—that the postal service must compete better, why would you try to cut Saturday delivery? It’s one of the service’s most powerful competitive edges!And when the postal service remains the standard-bearer for reliability and trust, why in the world would you put timely delivery at risk by trying to close 82 plants?And don’t even get me started on the Staples plan. That’s just another way to outsource and downgrade postal service jobs from career quality to minimum wage to make a few executives richer.As a plan, it stinks.As reality, it stinks even worse.We won’t allow it.And I’ll tell you something. There’s an interesting thing happening in America today. You see, the American people have begun to understand the connection between good jobs and a strong economy. Good jobs at the post office support local businesses. Our neighbors and friends get that basic idea, and we’re spreading the word.America is tired of losing middle-class jobs. We’re done with the downward spiral.The AFL-CIO did a poll recently. We asked a group of voters if they agreed with this simple statement: “We need to make sure that all of us, not just the CEOs get our fair share in our economy.”When we asked those making less than $50,000 a year, two out of three voters agreed, 66% said, yes, that’s right, we need to make sure all of us, not just CEOs get our fair share. Here’s the kicker. Guess who we asked? Registered Republicans. That poll was of voters registered with the Republican Party.Here’s what this means to me. It means a solid majority of working people of every stripe share the same basic challenges, and the same hopes and dreams, and we recognize economics are at the heart of our problems. And that’s why we’ve started educating, mobilizing and organizing these workers on a national scale.You see, I believe the labor movement has an opening in America today. Every day, more and more people are ready to hear what the labor movement has to say.But we have a challenge. We need to present a positive vision for the future, like what you’re doing with the idea of non-bank financial services at post offices, so under-served communities aren’t forced to pay huge fees to check-cashing companies and pay-day lenders. Sen. Elizabeth Warren likes the idea, and she’s pushing it, and that’s all well and good, but we don’t need a legislative solution. We’ve got a solid and independent piece of research pointing the way. The post office has the power to get the ball rolling today, and a recent poll found it’s a popular idea with the American public!What else do you want? All we need is a postmaster general who knows a little something about business, like maybe someone who sees the potential in $9 billion in added revenue from new service, rather than $750 million in savings from job-killing cuts.With ideas like these, we can start to show working-class people the good things we can accomplish by standing together, to build strength and prosperity for all of us.Ideas like these will help us motivate working-class voters to get to the polls, because if we want the policies our working families need, if we want all of us to get our fair share, we need the right leaders in our states and for this country. We’ve got to engage and turn out our people.When I say, “our people,” I mean union members and families but also like-minded folks in our communities.But don’t get me wrong. We’re not working for any candidate. We’re not building power for any political party. Not the Democratic Party. Not the Republican Party. We’re building power for working people, pure and simple. We’re looking at the long view.Yet I promise, nobody will work harder, or smarter, to elect the leaders who make the right commitments, and nobody will work harder, or longer, to defeat those who don’t, regardless of political party. We’re not going to hold our nose and endorse Democrats, just because they have a D next to their name. That’s not good enough.We’re asking hard questions of every candidate who wants our support, and one question we want every candidate to answer is, do you support the United States Postal Service? Do you believe in the U.S. Postal Service? Do you believe in postal workers? Will you grow the service, not shrink it? Will you build the service, not tear it down?Standing together, working people will change this country. It’ll take hard work, but we have an advantage mobilizing hard-working voters—because the values and policies we stand for, are directly in our shared interest. Raising wages, protecting health care and retirement security, making workplaces safe and jobs family-friendly, and making sure this economy works for the many, not just the wealthy few.Brothers and sisters, we have big things to do as a country—put our people back to work, raise wages, restore our democracy and build 21st century infrastructure.  We’re going to strengthen and grow the U.S. Postal Service, not throw it away.We’re building power from the ground up, and we’re taking it one day at a time. We don’t have to accomplish everything at once.We can take the time to do it right, because we know, the American people need what we have to offer. America needs solidarity.Sisters and brothers, from the Vatican to the VFW post and everywhere in between, people want an end to the politics of cruelty, the politics of poverty, the politics of exclusion.The time is right. The world is changing. America is changing. The power of the 99% is growing. This is the new story in America.This new national storyline did not start in Washington, D.C. or in the centers of American power. It didn’t come from Wall Street. It grows when whole communities join postal workers to defend the quality service of the USPS. It has risen up from the hotels and casinos and the taxi stands and from the early bus, when the domestic workers travel across town together for a day’s work.  It comes from the Facebook pages where Walmart workers meet and learn how much they have in common, and how strong they are. It comes from the college graduates trying to find jobs under crushing debt, and from those earning our terribly low, low minimum wage.And it is up to you and me, to each of us, to help make the voices of America, our America, heard in the workplace and in our national life.Work should never hold us down and trap us in poverty.

385,Trumka to Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen: We Build America ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-brotherhood-railroad-signalmen-we-build-america,7-14-2014,"Thank you, President [Dan] Pickett, for that warm introduction.  I’m honored to join you here at your convention.  Thank you!Thank you for inviting me.  It’s wonderful to speak to the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen. What a history you have, and what a future.Listen, the Railroad Signalmen may not be the biggest union in the AFL-CIO, but you fight well above your weight class.  That’s because of your powerful leadership, and the true dedication and skill of your members.  When it comes to crossing safety, and freight security, nobody holds a candle to the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen.That doesn’t happen by accident.  That’s not a product of luck.  That’s a result of strong leadership and hard work.  It speaks to the honor and commitment each of you members brings to the job every single day.  And I commend you for it.Let me tell you, when the fighting heats up—and we know it does—it feels good to have trade unionists like Dan Pickett in the foxhole next to me.  And I’d take a member of the BRS any day of the week.  I mean that sincerely.Brothers and sisters, let’s give your president a round of applause.  Thank you, Dan, for what you do and what you are.  I’m proud to call you my friend.  I’m proud to call you my brother.  I’ll stand with you anytime, anywhere, for as long as it takes.  Thank you.Give yourselves a hand, too!  You raised the issue of railroad safety and security, and you made it a national priority.  And as a result, you can carry on your important work. And you’re adding members.You and I know those members aren’t simply numbers on paper.  Each one represents a good job with great health benefits and retirement security.  You can raise a family on a job like this, and give your children a better life.  Each new member of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen means one more worker can step with confidence toward the American Dream.In a nutshell, that’s unionism.  It’s that simple.Sisters and brothers, when one more family can aspire to the American Dream, all of us come a little closer.The best way to the American Dream, is a union contract.The best way to win fair pay, is a union contract.The best way to retirement security, is a union contract.The best way to a better tomorrow, so you can give your family a decent life and health care and a good education, it all comes back to a union contract.We want a decent life.  It’s not too much to ask.  You prove it with everything you do, think of those quad gates at railroad crossings.  You make sure our families and freight travel safely, and you create good jobs at the same time.We’re the workers of America.  We create the wealth.  We install the switches and maintain the systems.  We drive the trucks and make the roads.  We build the bridges and bake the bread.  We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night.  That’s what we do. That’s who we are.  The American labor movement!Brothers and sisters, all across America our labor movement is building power for working people.  We’re strengthening our state federations of labor and CLCs.  We’re joining together with allies, in ways we never have before.  We’re a mainstream movement, and we’re acting like it.And yes, we will be campaigning hard in this electoral season.  All of us will be looking closely at each candidate for local, state and federal office, this year and next year, and the year after that.  We’ll ask these candidates tough, pointed questions, and we will get firm answers, solid commitments.  We won’t be taking anything for granted.You see, we don’t work for any candidate.  We’re not building power for any political party.  Not the Democratic Party.  Not the Republican Party.  We’re building power for working people, pure and simple.  We’re looking at the long view.Yet I promise, nobody will work harder than we will to elect the leaders who make the right commitments, and nobody will work harder to defeat those who don’t, regardless of political party.  We’re not going to hold our nose and endorse Democrats, just because they have a D next to their name.  That’s not good enough.Here’s why this is important.  The AFL-CIO did a poll recently about the potential electoral impact of raising wages.  We asked a group of voters if they agreed with this simple statement: “We need to make sure that all of us, not just the CEOs get our fair share in our economy.”When we asked those making less than $50,000 a year, two out of three voters agreed, 66% said, yes, that’s right, we need to make sure all of us, not just CEOs, get our fair share.Here’s the kicker.  This was not a poll of the general public.  This was a poll of registered Republicans.  You heard me right.  Two out of three working class voters registered with the Republican Party say we need to make sure all of us, not just CEOs, get our fair share of the wealth we create.Here’s what this means to me.  It means working people of every stripe share the same basic challenges, the same hopes and dreams.  And that’s why in the AFL-CIO we have started educating, mobilizing and organizing workers on a national scale.  We’re talking to everybody. Workers in unions.  Not in unions.  Never heard of unions.  We’re wide open.But we have a challenge.  Working-class voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential elections.  So if we want the policies our working families need, if we want all of us to get our fair share, we’ve got to engage and turn out our people.And by our people, yes, I’m talking about our members and families—but also regular working people who share our basic values, our aspirations.  I’m talking about our neighbors, friends we worship with, our cousins and all those people you know on Facebook, everybody.  All of us who feel that no matter how hard we work these days, we can’t get ahead.  We need everyone to know, we might not be able to get ahead alone, but we can get ahead together.Sisters and brothers, we have big things to accomplish as a country—put our people back to work, raise wages, restore our democracy and build 21st century infrastructure. You see, we’ve been talking about America’s infrastructure deficit for years, but maybe not the right way, because some people get frightened by the word “deficit.”The fact is, the American Society of Civil Engineers says America needs to upgrade our infrastructure to the tune of $3.6 trillion -- $3.6 trillion!  That’s a big number, but we shouldn’t be afraid of that number.  Because it’s not a sacrifice.  It’s an investment.  It’s exactly like planting seeds.  Put them in the ground.  You’ll see.  We’ll grow railroad tracks.  We’ll grow roads.  We’ll grow bridges.  We’ll grow an entire economy!Putting money in roads and railways will give us solid returns for generations.  Investing in good jobs yields a good result.But if we don’t put that seed in the ground, that’s not smart.  It’s not sensible.  It’s cutting yourself off at the knees.  And that’s what these politicians are doing to the American economy.That’s why, all over the country, I’ve been telling people American infrastructure spending will be the engine of job growth we need.  It will spur American manufacturing, with strong Buy America provisions to make sure workers and our companies invest in America’s communities. We will be more competitive with good roads, deep seaports, transit, rail, airports, better bridges!We’ll build them.  That’s how we build America!  That’s how we move America!Every family will share the benefit.  Every community.We’ll build the future we know we can have, and must have, and will have.  Because we believe in the power of America.  We believe in the American Dream.  We’ll never give up.  We’ll never back down.  We’ll never say quit.  We’ll never say die.  We’ll fight ‘til we win!We’re fighting for what’s right, for the people who do the work, and we intend to win.Let me tell you, infrastructure dollars are just the opener!  I’m talking about raising wages, job safety, fair trade and MADE IN AMERICA!Brothers and sisters, from the Vatican in Rome to the Moral Mondays in North Carolina and a dozen other places I could mention, people want an end to the politics of cruelty, the politics of poverty, the politics of exclusion.The time is right.  The world is changing.  America is changing.  The power of the 99% is growing.  This is the new story in America.This new national storyline did not start in Washington, D.C. or in the centers of American power.  It didn’t come from Wall Street.  It has risen up from the railroad tracks and the taxi stands and from the early bus, when the domestic workers travel across town together for a day’s work.  It comes from the Facebook pages where Walmart workers meet and learn how much they have in common, and how strong they are.  It comes from the college graduates trying to find jobs under crushing debt, and from those earning our terribly low, low federal minimum wage.Work should never hold us down and trap us in poverty.  Work must lift us up.  We want our country to work for the people who work!Power and hope are rising, brothers and sisters.Power and hope are rising.  It’s truly a groundswell, in the words of the great poet Maya Angelou, who died last month:
“Still I rise.” 
“Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,Still I’ll rise.
You may trod me in the very dirt, 
You may trod me in the very dirt,but still, like dust, I rise.”America’s workers are rising.  We’re standing up, standing together.  You’ve seen the fast food workers.  You’ve supported the Walmart workers.Every job has value.  There is no shame getting up in the morning and doing a job.  None at all. Every job has dignity, and we stand for the ideal that every worker, every single worker, must have a voice on the job for safety, for dignity, for fairness, for good pay and benefits, and for the prospect of a decent retirement.We’re not where we need to be, but we’re working to get there.  The great wealth divide, between the richest 1% and the rest of us, keeps getting bigger.  We’re going to turn that around, and start to narrow the gap.  But it’ll take a lot of work to get us there.  We’re fighting hard to raise wages, but we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us.  We’ve got organizing work to do, and, for the next four months, we’ve got electoral work to do.Let me re-emphasize that: We’ve got a long to-do list between now and November, and after.Listen, I know how hard you work. I know how dedicated you are. And I’ve got to tell you, working people need you again.  We need your political action.  We need you for legislative accountability.  We need you for our voter registration drives.  This is solidarity, for a better life. And it works.That’s what all our work is about.  It’s about changing our lives, lifting families, and scrambling and reaching for a little more hope.We have a vision.  And we’re going to make it real, because all of us pitch in, that’s shared responsibility, shared sacrifice.  We do what it takes.What we want is simple.  It’s what everybody wants, the chance to work hard for a decent life, for health care, for a secure retirement, and to give a better life to our kids.We’ll stand together, because we’re stronger together.We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  We’ll stand for it.  Together.  Each of us.  With solidarity. Real solidarity.  Where your picket line is my picket line.  And my picket line is your picket line. And we’ll stand together.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Arm-in-arm.  All day.  Every day.  As long as it takes.  To win together.  Because we’re going to win together.  Grow together.  To bring out the best in ourselves, to bring out the best in America.Thank you.  Thank you, and God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
386,Trumka to UNITE HERE: We Can Get Ahead Together,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-unite-here-we-can-get-ahead-together,6-27-2014,"Thank you!It’s an honor to be with you all. Thank you for inviting me. It’s wonderful to speak to UNITE HERE! What a history you have, and what a future!First, I want to tell you how much I love and admire this union. You’re a truly powerful force in America, and you know how to inspire us all, to help us persist in transforming our shared vision into reality.I’m thinking right now about the Frontier strike that ended in 1998, which strengthened the resolve of the Culinary Workers and every worker in Las Vegas, and ushered in a new era of prosperity for working people in that incredible city. I remember that fight like it was yesterday.I’m proud to have stood with you. We stood together on that picket line, solid, arm-in-arm, and I know we’ve got some Frontier strikers here with us today! Stand up! If you were on that picket line, stand up!Give yourselves a hand! You lifted up a generation of Nevada workers, but it wasn’t easy. It took seven long years. It took seven years! And after seven years, working people won!And I am so proud, so proud, I stood with you, and we stood together to make work pay.That same spirit is right here in this room. You see, I know just as well as you do that a hard-won victory can galvanize a generation. I have no doubt that the Frontier victory inspired thousands of families, tens of thousands, and can be traced backward to wins all across this country and forward to successful and in-progress organizing drives in places like Phoenix and New Orleans and Miami, to riverboats on the Mississippi and bottom-up fights in Houston and San Antonio.That’s unionism. And let me tell you what else is unionism: “Changing 50,000 More Lives.”That’s a beautiful theme. That’s a forward-looking theme. That’s a winning theme.Brothers and sisters, we’re going to change 50,000 lives for the better, and there’s just no telling all the good to come from it.The best way to fair pay, is a union contract.The best way to retirement security, is a union contract.The best way to a better tomorrow, so you can give your family a decent life and health care and a good education, it all comes back to a union contract.And a decent life is not too much to ask, because we’re the workers of America. We create the wealth. We turn on the lights and clean the rooms. We drive the trucks and make the roads. We build the bridges and bake the bread. We wake our country up every single day, and we tuck her into bed at night. We won’t be turned aside. We won’t be faced down, and we will not be denied.Sisters and brothers, we’re building power for working people. We’re strengthening our state federations of labor and CLCs. We’re joining together with allies, in ways we never have before. We’re a mainstream movement, and we’re acting like it.And yes, we will be campaigning hard in this electoral season. All of us will be looking closely at each candidate for local, state and federal office, this year and next year, and the year after that. We’ll ask these candidates tough, pointed questions, and we will get firm answers, solid commitments. We won’t be counting on gratitude.You see, we don’t work for any candidate. We’re not building power for any political party. Not the Democratic Party. Not the Republican Party. We’re building power for working people, pure and simple. We’re looking at the long view.Yet I promise, nobody will work harder to elect the leaders who make the right commitments, and nobody will work harder to defeat those who don’t, regardless of political party. We’re not going to hold our nose and endorse Democrats, just because they have a D next to their name. That’s not good enough.Here’s why this is important. The AFL-CIO did a poll the other day about the potential electoral impact of flat wages. We asked a group of voters if they agreed with this simple statement: “We need to make sure that all of us, not just the CEOs, get our fair share in our economy.”When we asked those making less than $50,000 a year, two out of three voters agreed, 66% said, yes, that’s right, we need to make sure all of us, not just CEOs get our fair share.Here’s the kicker. Guess who we asked? Registered Republicans. That poll was of voters registered with the Republican Party.Here’s what this means to me. It means working people of every stripe share the same basic challenges, and the same hopes and dreams. And that’s why we’ve started educating, mobilizing and organizing these workers on a national scale.But we have a challenge. Working-class voters are less likely to turn out in off-year elections.  So if we want the policies our working families need, if we want all of us to get our fair share, we need the right leaders in our states and for this country, we’ve got to engage and turn out our people.And by our people, yes, I’m talking about our members and families—but also regular working people who share our basic values, our aspirations.  I’m talking about our neighbors, our friends from church, our cousins and all those people you know on Facebook, everybody. All of us who feel that no matter how hard we work these days, we can’t get ahead, we need each other. We can’t get ahead alone. But we can get ahead together.It’ll take hard work, but we have an advantage mobilizing hard-working voters—because the values and policies we stand for, are directly in our shared interest. Raising wages, protecting health care and retirement security, making workplaces safe and jobs family-friendly, and making sure this economy works for the many, not just the wealthy few.Brothers and sisters, we have big things to do as a country—put our people back to work, raise wages, restore our democracy, and build 21st century infrastructure. And that’s just the opener. We’re going to end the mass incarceration of a generation of our brothers, we are going to end the practice of throwing young men of color into jail for years for having a bag of weed, or other nonviolent offenses.We can’t deny people opportunities and then, when they stumble, lock them in jail, and throw away the key.And, let me tell you, we’re going to end the crisis of our broken immigration system. We won’t have our families torn apart. We won’t let our immigration laws be used as a hammer to beat working people. We want a workable path to citizenship for the millions and millions of immigrants in America today, and we want deportations to stop. We want them to stop now!Right now, 1,100 people are deported every single day.Good people, who are American in every way but on paper, good people who have committed no crime other than working to build a better life, are hounded by the authorities in a democratic society. Families are torn to pieces. That’s just wrong, and it has to stop.Brothers and sisters, from the Vatican in Rome to the Moral Mondays in North Carolina, people want an end to the politics of cruelty, the politics of poverty, the politics of exclusion.The time is right. The world is changing. America is changing. The power of the 99% is growing. This is the new story in America.This new national storyline did not start in Washington, D.C. or in the centers of American power. It didn’t come from Wall Street. It has risen up from the hotels and casinos and the taxi stands and from the early bus, when the domestic workers travel across town together for a day’s work.  It comes from the Facebook pages where Walmart workers meet and learn how much they have in common, and how strong they are. It comes from the college graduates trying to find jobs under crushing debt, and from those earning our terribly low, low minimum wage.And it is up to you and me, to each of us, to help make the voices of America, our America, heard in the workplace and in our national life. Work should never hold us down and trap us in poverty. Work must lift us up. We want our country to work for the people who work!Power and hope are rising, sisters and brothers.Power and hope are rising. It’s truly a groundswell, in the words of the great poet Maya Angelou, who died last month:“Still I rise.”
“Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,Still I’ll rise.
“You may trod me in the very dirt… 
You may trod me in the very dirt…but still, like dust, I rise.”We’ve got a lot of work to do between now and November, and after.At the Washington office of the AFL-CIO this week, we’re holding a Citizenship Fair. You see, we’re helping green card holders become citizens. That’s not a new thing. UNITE HERE has had an active citizenship program for years.You know, for 100 years, the best path for immigrants to reach the American Dream was through a union hall. It’s the same today. And more and more of us in the labor movement are catching on. That’s a good thing. It’s an example of how the American labor movement will be building power for working people at the same time as we build for electoral politics. The two will create a cycle, always building power, always growing, always reaching for a better tomorrow.Listen, I know how hard you work. I know how dedicated you are. When it came to the Working Voice PAC two years ago, UNITE HERE stepped up with generous support, and I mean generous, and I thank you for your confidence and your leadership. Your contributions add vital strength to our political program, and I want you to know that it’s appreciated.Working people need you again. We need your political action. We need you for legislative accountability. We need your voter registration. And we need your organizing, we need it to show working people everywhere we can stand together, in solidarity, for a better life. It works.I know how well it works, because I see it even in so-called right-to-work states. I know of UNITE HERE hotels, in places like Phoenix, with 88% membership. That’s no accident. It’s a testament to service, it’s a testament to how solidarity changes lives.That’s what all our work is about. It’s about changing our lives, and scrambling and reaching for a little more hope.We have a vision. And we’re going to make it real, because all of us pitch in, that’s shared responsibility, shared sacrifice. We do what it takes.What we want is simple. It’s what everybody wants, the chance to work hard for a decent life, for health care, for a secure retirement, and to give a better life to our kids.We’ll stand together, because we’re stronger together.We’ll work for it, sisters and brothers.  We’ll stand for it.  Together.  Each of us. With solidarity. Real solidarity. Where your picket line is my picket line. And my picket line is your picket line. And we’ll stand together. Shoulder to shoulder. Arm-in-arm. All day. Every day. As long as it takes. To win together. Because we’re going to win together. Grow together. To bring out the best in ourselves, to bring out the best in America.Thank you. Thank you, and God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
387,Trumka Outlines Lessons from the Financial Crisis ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-outlines-lessons-financial-crisis,6-20-2014,"Good morning everyone. Welcome.It is great to have all of you here. Before I begin, I’d like to acknowledge Pia Bungarten of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and Gustav Horn of the Macroeconomics Institute of the Hans Boeckler Foundation for partnering with the AFL-CIO in sponsoring today’s conference.I also want to welcome Michael Sommer, who recently stepped down as head of the German Trade Union Federation to become vice president of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation.Before I deliver the substance of my remarks this morning, I want to say a few more words about our dear friend Pia.After five years directing the Washington office of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, Pia will soon return to the foundation’s headquarters in Bonn to take up a leadership position there. Today’s event may well be her last public event in Washington.Bonn’s gain will be Washington’s loss, and we at the AFL-CIO will feel that loss especially. Over the last several years, Pia has been a true citizen-ambassador for the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, for Germany’s Social Democratic Party and for Germany itself. She’s always fostered rich and meaningful dialogue on economics and foreign policy, always in the service of stronger trans-Atlantic relationships. Those relationships are truly an essential pillar of world peace and shared prosperity.Here’s the thing: Politics and economics are team sports, but sometimes one person can make the whole league play better, and that’s what Pia did with regard to the quality of our political conversations and the depth of the relationships between the German and American labor movements.Pia, thank you for your spirit, your integrity, your ideas and your work ethic, and good luck to you in your new assignment. You will always be welcome at the AFL-CIO, and I hope we keep in touch and continue to work together.My friends, please join me in a round of applause for Pia Bungarten.Last year, we held two conferences: first one in Washington and then a second in Berlin. The conferences had one theme—A Trans-Atlantic Agenda for Shared Prosperity.Our charge, our responsibility, is to take the policy ideas from last year’s conferences and find ways to put them into practice in the United States and in Europe’s largest economy.The financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession that followed are the worst economic events since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  And in reality this crisis is not over.  Just a month ago, we saw the European Central Bank adopt negative interest rates to head off the threat of EU-wide deflation.  And yet, too many in the press, in think tanks, and most of all, in positions of political leadership, have returned to the pre-crisis mentality.Quite frankly, that mentality has led to major policy failures causing needless suffering for millions of working people, men and women and families who lost homes and jobs and who will bear the pain of this Great Recession for decades to come.In Europe, we all know the price of austerity as a response to economic crisis—unending economic crisis and, on the political side, a resurgence of right-wing authoritarianism as voters lose confidence in democracy itself.What is less well known is how these same ideas have damaged the United States.It has taken more than six years -- six years -- for the U.S. economy to reach the same number of jobs we had before the Great Recession started.  The unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 6.3%, which equals the peak rate during the recession in the early 2000s.But the unemployment rate isn’t the full measure of what’s wrong with our labor markets.  More and more people are dropping out of the labor force entirely. The rate of eligible workers in the labor force has dropped to about 63%, which is as low as it was in the late 1970s.And most important, austerity has meant years of stagnating real wages for most of America’s workers.  But this is not a new story—wage suppression has been at the center of the U.S. economy since the late 1970s.  Over the decades since then we have seen brief moments of rising wages at the peak of debt-driven boom-bust business cycles, but stagnation has been the norm. This is a core pathology in our economy whose structures—everything from trade policy and monetary policy to our labor and employment laws—have been designed to keep wages from growing in tandem with workers’ productivity.And now we see these same structures are operating on a global scale, keeping unemployment high, labor markets soft and worker bargaining power weak.  The result is a fundamentally unstable and broken world economy, where deflation is an ever-present threat, and the only sources of growth are financial bubbles and international capital chasing ever-lower wages.Of course, whether or not the global economy is broken depends on where you sit.  For a relatively small number of people, this system has produced wealth beyond the dreams of Midas.  And this makes many political leaders eager to find economic policies that both cater to this global economic elite and somehow address inequality.  But there is no way to do that.We see this in the schizophrenia of major international economic institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the OECD.  As I have said elsewhere, on Monday they decry inequality and call for shared prosperity, and on Tuesday they defend austerity and attack workers’ rights.  Here in the U.S. we have a particular version of this problem—nostalgia for the 1990s.  The 1990s were a time when for a few brief years it seemed like financial speculation actually could produce rising wages—that plutocracy could work for everyone.  But it is clear today that those years were just a phase in a downward spiral—an economy built on falling wages and redistribution from working people to the rich, made tolerable with brief episodes of prosperity driven by asset bubbles. The 1990s might look like prosperity on paper, but it was fake debt-fueled bubble prosperity, and meanwhile financialization, corporate-oriented trade policies and weakening worker bargaining power eroded the foundations of shared prosperity. It was the kind of prosperity you ultimately pay for with a financial crisis and a collapse.We cannot afford more efforts to find common ground between democracy and plutocracy.And while this may be a tough message here in D.C., when you get outside of Washington, it turns out that all kinds of people are tired of the status quo of an economy that only works for a privileged few.  Last week, Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was at a fundraiser in Washington as his constituents voted in droves for his opponent, an unknown college professor. The pundits went nuts trying to figure it out, but it’s clear as day to me. Eric Cantor played the Washington game of obstruction to the hilt, and as his opponent frequently said, he was the man who put the “crony” in “crony capitalism.”Regular people are sick of that game—no matter whether we are Democrats or Republicans. We’re sick of it.  And we have figured out that the whole game amounts to flat paychecks for us while a handful of people get fantastically rich.  And so I have good news, because here in America millions of people are finding a constructive outlet for our anger and dissatisfaction. Look at the growth of solidarity among fast food workers, among day laborers, taxi workers, TV writers, college graduates, Walmart workers, domestic workers, hotel workers and so many more.At the same time my German friends tell me that a lot of people in Germany have learned that when workers have a real say in the economy the economy works better.  And so even though Germany has a coalition government, that government is moving forward to create a minimum wage that is worth close to $12 an hour, and at the same time is looking at measures to strengthen collective bargaining and codetermination.In every major economy, when we ask the question, “What have we learned from the crisis?” we face the issue of “Who is “we”?”Economic elites seem to have learned that they can go on as they did before the crisis, accumulating wealth others created.  Some politicians seem to think that they can keep carrying water for economic elites and still get the votes of the majority whose incomes keep falling.  That, it seems to me, was Eric Cantor’s mistake.  Others, the real leaders, respond to this great choice with a clear answer -- shared prosperity, rising wages, a restored democracy must come first.Today, you will hear from one of those leaders, the chairman of the House Progressive Caucus, Keith Ellison.  Keith, like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown and Mayors Bill De Blasio and Marty Walsh, clearly stands against plutocracy. These leaders have solutions that go beyond the hatreds and mythical ideologies that inspire the radical right here and in Europe. At the core of their program is one big idea—and that idea is shared prosperity.Working people are ready to work—to pound the pavement—for political leaders who can show that they have learned from the crisis. And America has begun to have a long overdue national debate. If the chattering classes in D.C. would listen, they’d hear the echoes of the debate from Cantor’s district. We want this debate in every contest for state and federal office, in every country, and in the offices of every international organization. We want an answer to the simple question: What do we want our global economy to look like so it delivers shared prosperity?Do we want it to be a plantation? Or a community?That is a serious question, because in an age of global financial and economic integration, of imminent climate catastrophe, of environmental problems that become economic problems that become national security problems in a matter of days, our world simply cannot afford the plantation model any longer.  It is a recipe for catastrophe.  That in a nutshell is the lesson of the economic crisis.And what does community look like?  You all will discuss this today in detail, but let me offer a couple of suggestions.First, in a community, there is full employment and everyone has access to a good job with decent conditions in an economy where wages rise with productivity.Second, in a community we invest in public goods—the things that make the good life possible for all of us—from roads and bridges to high-speed rail to clean energy to world-class schools.  And that should start with making sure everyone on our planet has access to the basics of modern life—from clean water to Internet access.Third, in a community we all have a voice, on the job and at the polling place.  And a voice on the job means the right to bargain together, as a union, with our employers.Fourth, in a community we all pay our fair share in taxes.And perhaps most importantly, in a global community, these principles apply everywhere.  There should be no room in a global community for tax havens, or little principalities where dictators and hereditary monarchs torture workers who demand a living wage, or huge global economic powers that build the wealth of their national elites on impoverished and silenced workers—and by the way, I want you to think carefully about what countries I might be talking about in that last category.If we hold to these principles, we can create a new global New Deal that ushers in a new day of shared prosperity and democracy.  And that would be a legacy of the crisis worth defending.I hope today we get to debate the agenda I have outlined.  I am sure many of you have brought your own agendas to this discussion.  What I hope we have in common here is that our answer to the question of what have we learned from the crisis is that we must have fundamental, structural economic change if we are to remake the global economy as a community and not a plantation.Now, as you can see from the program, we have assembled an outstanding group of economists to speak on these issues. And at lunchtime we will hear from two distinguished policymakers – Congressman Keith Ellison, who is co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and Michael Sommer, who is vice president of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and former president of the German Trade Union Confederation.The AFL-CIO is deeply honored to have the privilege of co-sponsoring such a distinguished gathering of policymakers and economic thinkers. And now, let me turn the floor over to this morning’s panel. Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
388,"Trumka to New York NAACP: ""What will be our future?""",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-new-york-naacp-what-will-be-our-future,6-11-2014,"Good evening.  I am honored to be with you tonight at the first chartered branch of the NAACP, at the institution often known as the labor branch of the NAACP.  And I am humbled that you are honoring me, and allowing me a small part in the shared history of the civil rights and labor movements.It’s especially meaningful to me to accept this award in 2014.  This is a anniversary year for civil rights milestones.  A few weeks ago, we marked the 60th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education.  In 1954, before the AFL-CIO was born, the CIO filed an amicus brief in that landmark case.  And less than a month from now, on July 1, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Civil Rights Act.These milestones have prompted me to think about the hurdles our movements face, both then and now.  In the struggle for rights in the workplace, in civil society and at the voting booth, haven’t we always faced the twin challenges of public indifference and concerted opposition?Activists in every movement and every era, I suppose, must feel that the world into which we are born is a conspiracy against the cultivation of our dreams of freedom and justice.  Yet it is only because the world views our ideals with such coldness and outright hostility that we are compelled to broaden our reach and organize those who share our dreams and values.Back in Washington in the offices of the AFL-CIO, we have many objects and pieces of art gathered by the labor movement over the past 100 years.  Among them, no object is more prized, and no object issues a greater challenge than a case of 100 pens that hangs in our hallway.   President Lyndon Baines Johnson used each pen to sign a bill enacted by Congress during a brief, extraordinary period in our nation’s history that began following the assassination of President Kennedy.President Johnson presented that case to the AFL-CIO when I was just a boy in school, in gratitude for the help working people gave in passing the legislation that truly made America a greater society.  At the top is the pen that signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.The men and women of the American labor movement who earned this gift are for the most part no longer with us.  I’m talking about the first African American Vice President of the AFL-CIO, A. Philip Randolph, who, with his deputy Bayard Rustin, were organizers of the 1963 March on Washington.  I’m talking about Walter Reuther, the president of the United Auto Workers who helped fund the March, and I’m talking about so many other men and women who endured every day disrespect and discrimination, yet never lost their dignity or determination, and found it within themselves to organize for their dreams and for the children of a nation.   We here tonight are who we are, we lead the lives we lead, we live in a far better country—because of them.How much better?  That is the fundamental question, isn’t it?  In the America of 50 years ago, we did terrifying harm to each other routinely and without consequence.  In different parts of our country, for African Americans, Asians, Latinos or Native Americans to enter a public space was to be humiliated.  To be told, “You can’t go in there” when you wanted to go to a restaurant, to have to explain to your children why they could not go to the amusement park or to the beach they saw on TV, to have to use the side entrances everywhere from movie theaters to railroad stations—a system of humiliation designed to cater to and reinforce the deep social sickness of racism that has infected white America from the days of slavery and conquest.  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 changed much of that.The workplace, too, was routinely a place of discrimination and humiliation and dreams denied—for people of color, for women and for Jews and Catholics.  A place of closed doors, iron ceilings and raw bigotry.  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 changed a lot of that—and gave us many tools we still use today to continue the work of ending discrimination in the workplace. The way to honor the women and men of the Civil Rights Revolution is not by giving them halos and isolating them and their causes in museums and memorials.  Because those men and women themselves spent little time looking backwards.  They had their eyes on the prize, and so should we.  The question we should ask tonight is not, “What is our past?”—because we know where we came from.  The question we should ask is, “What will be our future?”  What will the civil rights movement mean 50 years from now?  What will we accomplish that will be worthy of remembering at the 100th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?Because the great questions of the civil rights movement are not specific to any time.  They are as old as the Bible and as new as racial profiling and the deportation crisis tearing apart immigrant families.  Are we truly brothers and sisters? Do our country, our government, our laws defend the dignity of each of us equally?  Are some of us shouting and others silenced?  Do we share in the great wealth of America as much as we share in creating that wealth—or are some of us so rich and some of us so impoverished that we forget our own humanity?  Is our country’s economic model a plantation or a community?These are the questions of our time. To get to the answers we want, we have to be clear-eyed, big-hearted and very, very smart. To get to the answers we want, we need to free our national spirit. We need the vision to see 50 years ahead, and the vigor to get there one day at a time.It won’t be easy. We can see the struggle to incubate this new America all around us.   It is often a struggle between those who want to embrace our future and those who can only be dragged forward, kicking and screaming. The attacks on voting rights.  The appeals to racial hatred. The murder of Trayvon Martin. The war on women.  The irrational hatred of our president, fomented and funded by highly rational people with a perverse agenda.  And the hatred toward Latino immigrants and the great rush to deport them and tear apart their families.This struggle—between hope for the future and fear of it—points to the questions we must answer.Will we reverse the terrible economic destruction wrought on communities of color by Wall Street?  The mass destruction of African American home ownership?  The economic collapse of African American and Latino families—whose median net worth is less than the value of a second-rate used car?Will we end the shame of our dual caste society—where more than 11 million of our undocumented friends, neighbors and co-workers do our country’s work but cannot vote?  How will the Americans of 2064 judge us for letting this injustice continue?Will we, in 2064, still incarcerate more of our citizens than any other developed country? Will mass incarceration of young men of color seem as far away in 2064 as segregated water fountains do today?In 2064, will our government treat people of color, and young people, and seniors who try to vote as if they are doing something wrong?  Will our nation still be playing the strange game of Jim Crow—with arcane ID laws designed to stop fraud that doesn’t exist, closing polling places and limiting registration hours—or will we do as other democracies do and try to make it easy to vote? And finally, in 2064, what will we be able to say about how men treat women in our workplaces?  What will an hour of women’s work be worth? We do not know the answers to these questions, but we do know what will determine the answers.  It is not the passive good will of our fellow citizens.  It is not the inevitable march of progress. There is no such thing. You could say that the Civil Rights Act was the product of Lyndon Johnson’s formidable political will, or Martin Luther King Jr.’s vision and leadership, or the martyred little girls dead in a church in Birmingham.  But the real truth is that the Civil Rights Act was the product of all of that and so much more—of political and moral and social power—of our movements—and the mass movement made visible on the Mall in the March on Washington in August 1963, after years and years of marches stubbornly organized and held.The March on Washington and a great and peaceful movement propelled the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but that was not all the March set out to do.  The demands of the March on Washington were Jobs, Justice, Education and Freedom.  We need jobs, justice, education and freedom today. In our time, each of us will have a part to play in the movements that will take us to 2064.  Those who grow the movements of tomorrow need our help. So ask yourself tonight, “What can I do to organize, to build a new movement for jobs, for justice, for education, and yes, most of all for freedom—in my workplace, in my community, in my country?”So that when our grandchildren call the roll in 2064, you and I—each of us here—holds a place in the great journey of our country.Stretching back to Dr. King and Eugene Debs, to Mother Jones and Harriett Tubman and Rosa Parks, to Cesar Chavez and Harvey Milk.To names long forgotten in the dim past of slave revolts and peasant rebellions and citizen uprisings.And stretching forward in time to people yet to be born who will ask of us: What did we do? Where did we march? With whom did we stand?  What did we do, in our time, here and now, to make justice flow down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream? And let our answer be: We played our part, we took our steps in our nation’s journey toward justice.  Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
389,Trumka: The Catholic Case Against Libertarianism,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-catholic-case-against-libertarianism,6-3-2014,"Good afternoon. My name is Rich Trumka. I’m president of America’s federation of labor unions, the AFL-CIO, and I’m so pleased to be with you at this critical meeting here at Catholic University, this great center of learning and moral teaching.  I’m particularly honored to have been asked to introduce one of the world’s foremost faith leaders, but before I get to my introduction of this truly extraordinary man who will speak to us today on the Catholic Case Against Libertarianism, I want to tell you a story.I grew up in a small town called Nemacolin, in the coal country of Southwest Pennsylvania. Pretty much every man in my family worked in the mines.  My town was a company town, which means the mining company owned everything, every house, every yard, the company store, every square foot with the exception of Our Lady of Consolation Church, which was at the heart of our town’s Catholic community.The company even paid us with script, not U.S. currency, so we could only shop at the company store.  Slavery was illegal, but we weren’t free either.Before my time, back in the 1920s and '30s, it seemed like nothing and no one could stand in the way of the coal companies’ pursuit of profit.  They had a special police force at their call—the Coal and Iron Police.  The companies’ private guards threatened, attacked and even murdered miners who tried to stand together to form our union—my union, the United Mine Workers of America.My dad used to tell me about one time, after company guards broke up a union meeting, a mounted troop of Coal and Iron Police tried to run down him and my granddad.  I know just where it happened.  My dad and granddad ran through the woods and over a hill and up the steps, and into Our Lady of Consolation Church.  Father Simko heard the commotion and came out front with a crucifix raised high like this, and he stepped right between my dad and granddad and the mounted police, who came thundering up the hill and onto the church steps.  He held up that cross as a shield and said, “You can’t ride up on these steps. This is a sanctuary!”You see, I grew up in a community where the church was alive with working people.  It was a refuge against injustice, a place of compassion, a flesh-and-blood sanctuary.I don't need to tell you that a lot has changed since Father Simko raised that crucifix.  We formed our union.  My dad and granddad both raised families and have now passed away.  My father died of black lung from all those years working underground.  Like them, I was a coal miner, too, before I became president of my union and then of the AFL-CIO.Times have changed, yet over the past year, our church has brought newfound vigor to traditional Catholic social doctrine, highlighting the dangers and injustices of our modern economic and political lives.  Pope Francis has spoken against mass unemployment and human trafficking—he called it a “scourge.”  Pope Francis speaks of work as “both a gift and a duty.” He said, “Labor is not a mere commodity, but has its own inherent dignity and worth.”Not long ago in Rome, Pope Francis said, “Solidarity, this word that strikes fear in the more developed world.  It’s almost a dirty word. But it is our word!”Pope Francis could not be more right.  For more than a hundred years around the world, the labor movement and the Catholic Church have stood together in solidarity for people who labor for a living.And this is an important time for us to be talking solidarity—especially because we also hear a lot of talk about libertarianism.  Even as our church has raised its voice for workers, libertarianism is challenging our church’s very commitment to ideas of solidarity, challenging our ties to each other.  Libertarianism sounds like a good thing, it sounds like liberty, but it’s not. It’s the notion that we, as individuals, have no responsibility toward one another, that we can do whatever we want to each other, anything at all, that in a fundamental way we are isolated and cut off from each other, and that whatever happens to each of us as a result is OK.That idea is a demonstrably false picture of how human beings live meaningful lives, and it leads to an unmanageable world where we cannot solve common problems together. But libertarianism is worse than that.  It’s contrary to the core doctrinal understandings of the Catholic faith.  And, in the past, both the labor movement and the Catholic Church have stood up against libertarianism, and we must confront it again, and name it for what it is.Libertarianism is not liberty, as I said. It is a doctrine that makes excuses for human beings oppressing each other.  Think about the story I told you about my family.  It’s a story about how libertarianism becomes authoritarianism.  The Coal and Iron Police enforced a system of private power and inequality that was cloaked in the rhetoric of libertarianism—the idea that the coal company, because it was a private actor and owned everything in our town, could do what it wanted, without regard to the human consequences, and could use violence against its victims when we objected.Together, the Catholic Church and the labor movement stand for a different moral and political order entirely.  We stand for liberty that comes from living and engaging in a democratic society.  We stand for communities bound together by solidarity.  We believe in the duty to ease pain and to comfort those who are suffering—and not just with kind words, but with action.That is why I am so heartened by the words of our Holy Father Pope Francis.  No one has done as much in as short a time to raise the plight of the world’s laboring millions as he has.  With Twitter, with his writings, with his spoken word, Pope Francis has forcefully asserted the foundational teachings of the Catholic Church.  From the Vatican, he has opened the door for all believers to experience again the transformative grace of a merciful God.Some people act surprised at the Holy Father’s teachings.  But no one should be.  He is holding up and restating the very foundations of Christianity -- the teachings of Jesus Christ.  We are connected to each other.  We are bound together.  Our church must never walk away from the principle that we are sisters and brothers, part of God’s family, and that every person has dignity and worth as a child of God.And that’s why this gathering is so important here, in this great institution of Catholic learning, where people like John A. Ryan and George Higgins did so much to advance the cause of social justice in America.Their spirit is sorely needed today.  Look outside this hall, around this country, across the globe, where is the spirit of compassion our Holy Father embodies?  Where is the moral order we seek, when working people labor harder and harder for less and less, when 11 million immigrants are hounded by the authorities—just as my dad and granddad were hounded—for no crime other than coming to this country with the dream of providing for their families?  Where is the mercy for our struggling families?Pope Francis is speaking for the church I grew up in when he calls for an organized moral response to the injustices of modern capitalism.  Pope Francis is not breaking new ground with his concern and love for the world’s poor, but rather embracing cornerstone Catholic teachings at the highest level.  Nor is he speaking only to the poorest nations of the earth.  We in the United States need to listen very closely, as his message is directed very much at us.And so we are indeed fortunate today to have with us a man who truly walks the same path as our Holy Father.  I'm not a Catholic scholar, but I'm told many of Pope Francis' teachings can be traced to Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez.  Just as my father and grandfather taught me about solidarity, Cardinal Rodriguez with his powerful words and humble ways, mentored and taught Pope Francis.  Cardinal Rodriguez, who comes to us from Honduras, one of the poorest dioceses in the Western Hemisphere, gave Pope Francis a lasting model of courageous activism and merciful love.  He also chairs the pope’s council of eight cardinals, his council of reformers.  Many people don’t know this, but in the 1990s Cardinal Rodriguez almost single-handedly took on the problem of crushing government debt in the developing world, where millions struggled to repay billions in loans squandered by corrupt leaders.  I’ve heard it said the Cardinal practically chased the IMF and the World Bank around the globe in his successful search for justice, and as a result millions upon millions of families have clean water and good food to eat, schools to attend and other necessary public services.Cardinal Rodriguez, I anticipate listening closely to every word you say to us here.  I know of and admire your passion and your leadership, and I am told you speak with the pope by cell phone at least every few days.  Well, my dear cardinal, when you speak next with Pope Francis, please tell him the workers of America love him and thank him.My friends, please join me in welcoming the archbishop of Tegucigalpa, His Eminence Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

390,"Trumka to ITUC: Organize, Organize, Organize! ",https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-ituc-organize-organize-organize,5-19-2014,"Brothers and sisters, I am honored to be with all of you, because together we stand alongside the working men and women who are the backbone of the global economy. And I don’t mean only union members, I mean all working people. Whatever our line of work, from taxi drivers to teachers to autoworkers to bidi rollers, we create value. And whatever our personal beliefs, we are unified by basic interests and a common vision, in which all people who work get a fair share of what we produce. It’s that simple.And yet our vision is far from reality. We have plenty of work to do.First, let me say I fully support the priorities outlined at this Congress to transform our movement into a global power to organize workers and to shape pro-worker policies. We’re creating a new and vibrant global labor movement, and I want to thank Sharan Burrow for her tremendous leadership and for making the ITUC a place of action. We will continue to work with you and your team. And many thanks, also, to Michael Sommer for your commitment and leadership here at the ITUC.As we speak together today, our economies remain sluggish, held down by the politics of austerity. Workers everywhere are living with the worst global jobs crisis in almost a century. This is no accident. It was designed. Don’t let anyone tell you different. Fortunately, many people, including some of our leaders, are starting to get that. Yet while we hear less about austerity and more about investment and good jobs, it’s been too much talk and too little action.Our leaders must invest in our future to promote real growth, growth based on rising wages and good jobs, instead of cheap credit and giveaways to the super-rich.Yet as a global labor movement, we have our own work to do. My friends, it’s time for all of us to renew our investments in the future of working people, by putting resources into organizing new members. Our priorities are the same as workers everywhere, and if you have any doubt of that, you need only review the ITUC global survey. So let’s reach out to those brothers and sisters who need unionism the most. Let’s reach out to unorganized port workers in Colombia, to sub-contracted workers in Indonesia, to bank workers in the U.S., to healthcare workers in South Africa.You see, the ideals of unionism are something we all share, just as we will all share the same fate if we allow these ideals to be trampled on. Employers like WalMart and Foxconn, T-Mobile, Amazon, Kellogg’s and temp agencies like Kelly, are eager to do just that.It’s our responsibility to stand with every worker who needs us, but our labor organizations aren’t large enough to do it alone. If we want to build transformational power, we must build broader coalitions. We have to join forces in civil society, on education and women’s rights, migrant rights, young workers and so much more. Let’s open our doors and stand together with anyone who shares our values and wants to stand with us.We will have to struggle for every inch of progress. Workers always have. Yet we can and must win. We’ll use every tool at our disposal. For example, some of you may have noticed that I asked the General Council to include the U.S. on the ITUC’s country watch list. The American practice of firing workers who stand up to form a union—it happens routinely—puts us on this list. The American practice of deporting immigrant workers who speak out to form a union—it happens all the time—puts us on this list.Well, what do we do when employers threaten us? We organize, organize, and organize!We’ll stand together to create power, and we’ll use our power to create good jobs and a new, greener economy. We’ll use our power to support collective bargaining and minimum wage laws and social protections and fair tax policies that make corporations pay their fair share.In this global economy, we are all connected. Together we will make work pay for the people who work. Because we wake the world up each and every day, and we tuck her into bed at night. We forge the steel, sail the ships, mix the asphalt, bake the bread, wash the clothes and so much more. We will not be turned aside, and we will not be denied!© 2023 AFL-CIO.

391,Trumka: Infrastructure is an Investment,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-infrastructure-investment,5-15-2014,"Brothers and sisters, we’ve been talking about infrastructure for a long time, a long, long time. We’ve been talking long enough.It’s time for action.We’ve got some political work to do.You see, the politicians who say we can’t create jobs and we can’t afford safe bridges, good highways, smart energy grids and high-speed rail must be pretty ignorant about business, about real life, about the American economy.Putting money in roads and bridges is like planting seed corn. Investing in good jobs yields a good return. When you put seed in the ground, you get something to harvest. When you put cement in the ground, you get roads. When you put steel in the ground, you get train tracks. You get it.But if you don’t put that seed in the ground, that’s not smart. It’s not sensible. It’s not “thinking like business.” It’s cutting yourself off at the knees. And that’s what these politicians are doing to the American economy.The American Society of Civil Engineers says America needs infrastructure dollars -- like $3.6 trillion. $3.6 TRILLION!That’s to fix what we’ve got. We need the same amount again to build the next generation of infrastructure for America’s future.Don’t be afraid of those numbers. This is not a sacrifice. It’s an investment. It’s exactly like seed corn. Put it in the ground. You’ll see. We’ll grow roads. We’ll grow bridges. We’ll grow an entire economy!American infrastructure spending will be the engine of job growth our country needs. It will spur American manufacturing, because we’ll have strong Buy America provisions to make sure workers and our companies invest in America’s communities. We will be more competitive with good roads, deep seaports, transit, rail, airports, and better bridges!We’ll build them. That’s how we build America! That’s how we move America!Every family will share the benefit. Every community.We’re making this an electoral issue this fall. We’re standing with business and allies and partners to make sure politicians running for office can’t dodge the consequences of inaction.I want you to do something. Listen close. I want each and every one of you to call on Congress. Tell them the time to invest in our future is now. I want you to listen to who replies, and who doesn’t.Pay attention to who offers solutions, and who offers excuses. You see, we don’t care what political party you’re in, if you don’t support America’s future, we won’t support you!Because we’re going to make sure the American economy drives forward. It’ll take infrastructure dollars. That investment will be like an open door to a future real growth built on good wages, not cheap debt.That’s not too much to ask, sisters and brothers, for the people who wake America up each day and tuck her into bed at night. That’s not too much to ask for the people who grade the roadways and lay the asphalt, who build the bridges and drive the buses. We’ll fight for what’s right. We’ll stand together, shoulder to shoulder, and we won’t sit back or stand down, and we will not be denied!Thank you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
392,Trumka Bids Farewell to National Labor College,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-bids-farewell-national-labor-college,4-26-2014,"President Paula Peinovich, Dean Dan Katz, faculty, family, friends, past graduates and especially today’s graduates of the National Labor College, I am honored to congratulate you and celebrate your journey.Education is a funny thing, because there are so many ways we learn. School is one way. Work offers other ways. Everyday experiences add to your knowledge base, too. But something special happens when all three of those things come together, when you’ve lived and worked for a good while, and then you take the time to step back for some intensive study.Ideas aren’t abstract anymore, as they are when you’re young. When you’re older and more experienced, you know the reality behind the concepts, and you can apply them to your work lives.There’s an old union saying—I’m sure you’ve heard it—that innovation comes from the factory floor. It’s true. It’s another way to say that experience is about the best teacher there is, and one of the best tools to generate ideas.But innovative ideas can sit unused in your head sometimes. You need a mechanism to apply them to life. That’s why companies have research and development departments. The National Labor College has been many things to many people, and one of those things is an R&D department for our labor movement.You, each of you, is a walking, breathing illustration of the mission of the Labor College—to train and educate union workers, to enrich work and personal lives and also to develop stronger labor leaders.And quite frankly, I believe in you and in your future. I know this moment is bittersweet, because the brick-and-mortar days of the National Labor College will soon be behind us. On-line learning will continue for some workers, but the long-term future of the college is what you and our other graduates will contribute to the future of the labor movement.The labor movement will also be here for you. As you have studied and learned, our movement studies and learns—and we go forward. We never stop. We learn from what works and what doesn’t. Sometimes the lessons are hard—but nothing worth doing is easy, as you can attest.And let me tell you, if we pursue our shared future with even half the energy and plain old-fashioned stick-to-it-iveness you took to get these degrees, there's no end to what we'll be able to accomplish. I want to tell you a story. This is for the graduates. It’s also for the wives and husbands, the children and parents who all lent a hand to make this educational journey possible.  It’s not a big story—it’s about one of those small moments that come to mean so much in a life.Some of you might know I’m from Nemacolin, a small town in the southwest corner of Pennsylvania. My father and grandfather and uncles and other relatives and neighbors were coal miners, and those men and women stood together and bargained and suffered and worked to give me the opportunities I had. I owe everything to them, just as we all owe great debts to those who lifted us up.After high school, I followed my dad into the mines. It was stifling and dangerous down there. The sound bounced off the walls. You’d come out absolutely covered in dust and grime. Don’t even think about what’s in your lungs. My father and grandfather helped me figure out how to work my way through college. It took me seven years, and after that I went on to earn a law degree—working six months and going to school for six months.A few years later, when I was president of the United Mine Workers, I had been back up to my hometown on union business—probably a safety grievance or something—and I stopped in for dinner at my parents’ house. After we had eaten and talked awhile, I was headed out the door and back to Washington with my friend, Tom.As we walked past my father on the porch, my dad said, ""Wait.  Have you got your watch?"" I said, ""Yes."" ""Do you have enough money?""  He was reaching for his wallet. ""Yeah, Dad, thanks,"" I answered.He settled back into his chair and said, ""OK. Have a safe trip. God bless you."" As I swung the car door shut and we drove away, I felt humbled in a way I can't quite explain. Had I been younger, I might have been impatient or embarrassed, even. There I was—president of the United Mine Workers—and my aging father wanted to make sure I had my watch and some pocket money. And that simple, powerful moment has stayed with me.I guess if I had to make a parallel with that story, I’d say the National Labor College, our labor movement is like my dad, and you all are like I was, heading out the door to go about my life. It’s beautiful. And I promise you, we are so proud of this institution and what it has accomplished, so proud of you.It’s not easy to go to college, especially if you’re the first in your family to go, and especially if you’re a non-traditional student, working all day, writing papers half the night. I want you to know that your brothers and sisters recognize how special your degree is, and the learning it represents.Thank you. And let me give some advice—it's another thing my Dad always told me: Don't let anybody divide you. Fight for what's right. And fight twice as hard against what's wrong.Brothers and sisters, the working people of this country will take America back. We will rebuild the American Dream. There aren’t any short cuts or easy answers. We’ll do it the hard way, which is also the right way. And we will need each other to do it. Your role is important. And so I ask you, in your own way, by your own lights, to go forward from here to turn your dreams into reality and to be the best union members, the best leaders and the best people you can be.And like Dad said to me, ""Have a safe trip. God bless you.""© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
393,Trumka to Pennsylvania AFL-CIO Delegates: The Face of Labor is Changing,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-pennsylvania-afl-cio-delegates-face-labor-changing,4-11-2014,"Brothers and sisters, thank you!We’re doing it right now.  We’re doing it right now.  We’re building solidarity.  We’re broadening our movement.  We’re reaching out to each other.  We’re standing together.And it feels good!  This is what unionism looks like!Thank you, Brother Rick [Bloomingdale]!  Thank you for inviting me.  Thank you for being my union brother.  We’ve been through a lot together, and we’re not done yet.You see, the landscape of work here in Pennsylvania is changing.  Not long ago, most union members looked like me, and you and you and you.  And most of those union members did something like what I used to do, which was to work in a coal mine, or a steel mill, or on the railroad, or somewhere along the supply line, from the mines to the manufactured goods we built for America.Well, the face of labor is changing right here in Pittsburgh and all across America.But the complexion of the face doesn’t matter, because the principles remain the same.It’s about solidarity.  It’s about togetherness.  And unionism.The problems we face in America are great, and each of us alone may have more questions than answers, but we can have faith in unionism and democracy, because I know we can find the answers together.  We can find the solutions by standing shoulder to shoulder.  We can show workers across Pennsylvania and America unionism works.  And we can reclaim our American democracy for the people who work.Brothers and sisters, solidarity works.  I’m not saying so because I read about it.  I know it from personal experience.  And I want you to know, and tell your friends at work who couldn’t make it here today, I want you to know we will stand with you while you organize.  I will stand with you while you organize at Duquesne, at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, at the Three Rivers Casino.And if you’ve got to walk a picket line to get a fair contract, I’ll stand on that line like it’s my line!  I don’t say this lightly!  I mean it.  I will be here when you need me.  I’ll stand with you when it’s easy, and I’ll stand with you when it’s hard -- especially when it’s hard!Look around yourselves.  We are Pennsylvania workers!  This is ground zero for solidarity.  The American labor movement sprang up out of the rocks and dirt right here!  The American middle class grew right here!We’ll do it again, brothers and sisters, by the grace of God!We do it with solidarity.  Real solidarity!  I’ll stand with you!  You’ll stand with me!  We’ll be shoulder to shoulder.  We’ll get it done.  Get off your seat and on your feet.  We’ll rally and fight and march in the street, because we are America’s working people, and we will not be denied!Sisters and brothers, in his State of the Union remarks this year, President Obama spoke about the outrage of inequality in America.  Across the board, everyone from pundits to the pope, and even some CEOs! all say the same thing: Great and rising inequality is the biggest problem in America today.It’s really no surprise.  And we’ve been living it, and fighting against it for years -- decades!You see, over the past 40 years the richest 1% has taken a larger and larger share of our national income, leaving very little for the rest of us.  Between 1997 and 2008, before the crisis hit, all the income gains in our economy went to the top 10% of households.  Not some, not a lot—all.  The wages of the lower 90% of the workforce fell.That hurts.  We know this story all too well.  We’ve been living it.So think about this: If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation, it would be $10.75.  If it had kept pace with productivity, it would be $18.67 an hour.  Not bad, right?  If it had kept pace with the top 1%, it would be $28.75.  I think we could handle that.Work should raise people out of poverty, not trap people in it.Too many of us today feel trapped by the work we do.  It’s wrong.  It’s un-American.  Three words describe the overarching strategy pushed by right-wing CEOs and embraced by the Republican leadership, leaders like Gov. Tom Corbett.  Those words are, push pay down!We might also choose some different, more colorful words.You know the problems with Tom Corbett.  Do I have to go down the list?  You know them.  So do I.  What in the hell is Gov. Corbett thinking?  Right-to-work-for-less in Pennsylvania?  He must not want his job anymore.Let me tell you something.  Corbett is a Republican—but Democratic politicians aren’t automatically good, either.  Sometimes they drive me up the wall.  And in my lifetime I have seen some solid working-family Republicans from Pennsylvania who I’m proud to call friends. Corbett is not one of them.But from House Speaker John Boehner to Rep. Paul Ryan to Gov. Tom Corbett, and most all of the hard-right Republican politicians in between, everything they put forward just pushes pay down for everybody who works for a paycheck.Why does Corbett want to privatize state wine and spirits stores?  To push wages down.  Why does he want to voucherize public schools?  To push wages down.  How about privatizing the Turnpike?  The lottery?  Mental health services?  Same reason.  To push wages down.  It’s the same story every time, everywhere you look.Gov. Corbett talks about austerity, so why’s he giving billions in your tax money to profitable corporations and millionaires?  I think Corbett and his friends can have all the austerity they want.  We don’t want any of it.  Working people want prosperity!You see, Mr. Corbett, we have a better idea, two words: raise wages.If you look at everything we do in the labor movement, everything from these organizing drives, to our support for American manufacturing, to our call for $4 trillion to fix America’s aging and out-of-date infrastructure, all of it contributes to our broad effort to raise wages.Our state federations of labor and central labor councils have opened our doors to like-minded community allies.  We’re ready to plan with and stand with anyone who shares our values, and wants to stand with us.You see, we’ve got a single focus.  I want you to think about what I’m going to say.  Look at our work to promote comprehensive immigration reform, with a reasonable and workable path toward citizenship.  Look at our partnerships with worker centers and day laborers and domestic workers—these are the right things to do.  These campaigns are strengthening working people, so all of us can together pursue for the same goal -- raising wages!We’re building our campaign capacity, so we can elect more working family candidates, and, when they are in office, watch them like hawks to make sure they stand with us to fight to raise wages!We want to raise wages, we want to raise the federal minimum wage—to at least $10.10 an hour. That vote is coming up in the Senate in a few weeks, and we need your help?  This bill includes the federal tipped minimum wage, which has been stuck at the outrageous level of $2.13 since 1991!Brothers and sisters, sometimes after taxes, a tipped worker’s paycheck reads zero dollars and zero cents!  How is that possible in America?And right here in Pennsylvania, you’ve got some courageous leaders who want to lead the nation by raising the minimum wage—including tipped workers—to $12 an hour!  That’s more like it! That’s a step in the right direction.  You know what the next step is?  It’s called forming a union. Unions work!That’s what we’re about.  Raising wages is our top agenda item.  It’s the purpose behind all our political campaigns in 2014.  Our agenda is driving our politics.  We’re not putting politics first anymore, sisters and brothers.  Raising wages will not take a back seat, not to any political party, or any candidate.We say, “Raise wages!” because good jobs build America.America has a weak recovery, and we had an economic crisis because working people can hardly afford to buy anything, except on flimsy credit!  Consumer spending is the lion’s share of our economy.  If we raise wages, we can support our communities.  We can pay our bills.  Raising wages will make our economy strong!  And we want everyone to know it.  So this year we’ve launched a program called Common Sense Economics.  Worker to worker, we want to reach a million people with this clear, simple message: Raising wages works!Common Sense Economics will teach each and every one of us how to spread this message everywhere.Listen, if you work for a living, if you work hard and play by the rules, if you create value, you should never have to take a second job, or go to the food bank, or raise your kids in poverty. America is better than that.  We work harder than that.  America is richer than that.Because, you see, when we do our jobs, we make a paycheck for somebody.  We give somebody a raise.  Somebody's getting rich.  Somebody else, not us!  So let’s turn America right-side-up, so work will pay the people who work.My friends, we’re going to save America from the false patriots like Tom Corbett, who tear apart the foundations of our economy, to push pay down, to destroy good jobs.And we’re spreading the word: Workers are the solution!  Good jobs are the solution.  Union workers are secure workers and confident consumers, and confident consumers are what make the American economy grow!  It’s more than right.  It’s essential.  The right of workers to organize, to bargain collectively and raise our voices together in solidarity is just as important to our great nation as the right to vote!We’re on the right path, brothers and sisters.  A groundswell is growing, and it keeps getting bigger.  It's strong, and it'll get stronger.  It's a groundswell to raise wages, so all of us can live a better life.  And today this groundswell is right here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and we carry a simple message: Unite for a better life!History will show that the Pennsylvania labor led the way!To get it done, our activism must extend from the ballot box to the city streets, from the public space to the workplace.  I know you’ll do it.  That’s how we’ll rebuild the American Dream, with activism!We’ll stand together, to raise wages for all.  We’ll fight for firefighters and hotel workers and casino workers, for public workers and private workers!  We’ll march together.  For working families.  We won’t back down, or back up, or shut up, until we win a new chance for the American Dream.  We’ll shout here in Pennsylvania and all across America.  And we’ll show how much good raising wages can do.America hungers for unity, my friends.  America wants real progress.  Sisters and brothers, the strength of our movement is our solidarity, the connections between us.  We’re strong because of our trust and shared responsibility.  Our word is our bond.  That’s something I take seriously.These are the values that we share.So let me talk about my vision for what comes ahead.  Unions across America in the coming weeks and months will be talking to candidates and making endorsement decisions.  You’re doing it right here in Pittsburgh.  It’s a critical process in the labor movement before every election season.And I want to share with you my thoughts about how we will retain our political independence while fighting for the candidates who will fight for us.From city and county races on up, you’ve got a lot of work to do here in Pennsylvania, but it’s all good work, because need it to build strength for working families.All across America, we’re strengthening our labor movement.  We’re building capacity and strong alliances with like-minded organizations and community partners.  We’re finding those issues that unite us, that truly bring us together.  And we’re mobilizing around those issues. We’re registering voters.  We’re gearing up our programs.As we talk to candidates, as we talk to voters, we will prove to our endorsed candidates that broad prosperity is a good issue to campaign on.  We’ll prove that raising wages is a winning issue to campaign on.We will prove to our candidates that collective bargaining is not a dangerous word, so when our candidates go to City Hall, or Harrisburg, or Capitol Hill, or the White House, we can always be confident that broad prosperity, raising wages, and collective bargaining, will be out in the open, and right at the top of the agenda!And where we have to fight back, like right here against Gov. Corbett, let’s fight back hard! Let’s take these fights and throw them back at those who want to push pay down.  I want us to help lift more working people toward the middle class, so more workers have good pay and benefits, and a secure retirement.  So more workers have good union contracts.  I want to push for the things we want, not just holler about what we don’t want.What we want is simple.  It’s what everybody wants, the chance to work hard for a decent life, for health care, for a better life for our kids.  We want the American Dream, brothers and sisters, and we’ll stand together to get it.  Together.  We’ll go forward, and ain’t nobody going to turn us around! Thank you! God bless you and the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
394,Trumka to the Center for American Progress: America Needs a New Trade Policy,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-center-american-progress-america-needs-new-trade-policy,3-25-2014,"Thank you, Neera [Tanden], for the kind introduction.  I appreciate the good work of the Center for American Progress. I know that the Center has been wrestling with trade and inequality, among many other issues, and we appreciate the spirit of new thinking you have brought to international economic policy over the last few months.I’m pleased to be here today to talk about trade policy—and, more broadly, how the United States engages in the global economy, and what that means for America’s workers, and for workers around the world.Because you know, here in Washington, we rehash the same arguments over and over again.  This is true of trade in particular.  If you close your eyes at a trade event and listen, you might think it was 1999, or 1994.Back then, nobody really knew what the results of NAFTA would be. Today we do. They’re bad. And that’s why we cannot enact new trade agreements modeled on NAFTA. It’s also why we cannot use an outdated NAFTA-style process for arriving at those agreements, especially not in an election year. I’m talking about fast-track negotiations. That style of trade diplomacy requires trust. But the American people don’t trust the leaders of either party, and for good reason, because both parties can’t seem to kick a disastrous, outdated, failed model of global economic policies.Now, I say “economic policies” and not “trade policies” for a reason.  And it’s particularly important as the Obama Administration negotiates the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the trade agreement with the European Union. They’re called trade agreements, but that’s not what they really are.  The real issues our negotiators are sweating over are not tariffs, but governance—rules over investment, intellectual property, consumer and environmental protection, labor rights—issues not inherently trade-related.You see, NAFTA put corporations in charge of America’s economic strategy -- with the goal of shipping jobs off-shore to lower labor costs. The big trade deals since then used NAFTA as a starting blueprint—from the WTO to our bilateral relationship with China to the recent agreements with Korea, Colombia and Panama.And while we know there have been many changes in the trade template since NAFTA – especially in the important area of strengthening workers’ rights protections – in way too many other areas, this model has failed to evolve with our complex and dynamic global economy.  Over all – this model is simply not working, not here in the United States, not in most of our trading partners.  We have a lot of work to do to make this model work for working families – both in changing the rules and learning how to enforce them effectively.No other country pursues trade deals like we do.  Nobody else – not India or Germany, Sweden or China – uses these deals to get rid of good jobs.  We have lost more than 60,000 factories in the last dozen years, as major companies created more jobs offshore than at home, and imports outstripped exports year after year.  Our current account deficit in 1993 was 1% of GDP.  In 2012 it was almost three times that. We run our biggest trade deficit with China—the bulk of those imports is electronics. Many of our top 10 exports to China are basically trash – things like scrap metal and waste paper.We pursued the strategy that led to structural trade deficits on purpose, because it pitted the workers of our trading partners against our own, and against each other.  For their part, our trading partners short-changed their domestic markets in favor of supplying America, so they, too, pushed weak unions, low wages, artificially cheap currency and subsidies for foreign investment like tax-free export zones.This trade-fueled imbalance fed a glut of global savings.  That savings glut in turn funded a bloated global financial system, which gave us the global economic crisis of 2008 and today continues to fuel rising inequality around the world. For business, NAFTA – and the tax, deregulation, and austerity policies that went with it – seemed great.  But 2008 revealed how destructive these economic policies truly are.  The model chronically starves the productive sector and working families, while it fuels financial bubbles and busts, after which working people everywhere struggle to provide for ourselves and our families. Economists call it a crisis in global demand.In the U.S., we also have a crisis of competitiveness, because, ever since the 1980s, big business looked offshore first rather than investing in America as a place to produce anything.  Congress fought over every dollar, for everything from primary education and university research to roads, bridges, ports, airports and our social safety net.  As a result, we no longer invest in the ideas of the future, and the American Society of Civil Engineers rates our infrastructure a D+.  That’s not where America should be.The net result has been accelerating, radical economic inequality.  That’s what it was intended to do.  It shifted our GDP’s composition from wages to corporate profits.  Ninety percent of America's working people have seen their wages drop in real terms over the past 10 years.  Not stay the same.  Drop.Let me give you a real-world example of that impact.  Of the workers who have been directly laid off because of off-shoring, the Washington Post said last week, the fortunate ones who found new jobs took on average a 20% pay cut.  Think about it—how would you or your family cope with a pay cut like that?That’s how this global model has killed effective demand.  Countries everywhere pushed ahead to push wages down.  Look at Mexico.  The poverty rate remains higher than 50%, and the minimum wage has lost almost 40% of its purchasing power since the early 1990s.  How's that for a bargain?NAFTA worked too well.  It’s still keeping wages low.  It’s still subverting the rule of law.  The law here guarantees all workers the right to bargain collectively with their employers if they so choose, free of retaliation by both the employer and the government.  Yet look what happened when Volkswagen workers in Chattanooga tried to exercise that right.  Government officials, starting with NAFTA-advocate Sen. Bob Corker, threatened those workers, saying a new VW assembly line would go to Mexico rather than Chattanooga if the workers voted to form a union.Maybe that’s why proponents of these outdated agreements no longer say they’re good for everyone, or even most of us.  Instead, they say we don’t have a choice.  It’s an argument as old as human society – the argument that injustice is inevitable.It’s old, but wrong.  The NAFTA model is not inevitable.  We have a choice, and we will choose between the world economy of today—with slow growth, high unemployment and obscene levels of inequality—and the world of tomorrow, of broadly shared prosperity.  We will choose between a world of wealth for the 1% with poverty for the rest of us, and a world in which all of us who work hard can enjoy the fruits of our labor.Yes, there is a better way.  And its best advocate is President Obama, on his better days.  A few years ago in Pittsburgh at the G20 Summit, President Obama said, and I quote:  ""We can no longer meet the challenges of the 21st century economy with 20th century approaches.""  He put an emphasis on making our institutions reflect the realities of our times.  He talked about helping people climb out of poverty, about food security and clean and affordable energy, and most of all he talked about jobs in a world with unprecedented levels of unemployment.President Obama continued to press for jobs, growth and fairness, even as the European Union did the opposite with austerity.America and the world need to expand on President Obama’s vision, not reject it.  We need new policies to spark a virtuous cycle where rising wages fuel demand, not flimsy debt-driven demand but healthy demand, which would in turn spark business investment and more jobs and higher wages in a strong cycle of global growth that works for all our families, for the environment and our communities.We need a global New Deal, a worldwide program to bring the basic infrastructure of modern society—electricity, water, schools, roads, internet access—to everyone on Earth.  It’s the right thing to do, and it would build our economies by giving us more customers.Yet President Obama has not consistently pursued the vision he laid forth at the G-20.  In TPP and in the talks with the EU we see again the old NAFTA template, but with a new, aggressive corporate twist.  This has been particularly clear in the European negotiations, whose advocates talk not about tariffs at all but what they call “behind the border barriers.”  What they’re talking about are the rules and regulations that create safe workplaces, clean water, safe food and all the things that make life decent and good.In the Trans-Pacific context, the question is really this:  Are we building a trade zone to compete with China or to emulate China?  And on what basis?  Because it isn’t clear from the current path of negotiations that either of these options can or should succeed.  We aren’t going to undercut China by curtailing our own democratic rights and freedoms – and we shouldn’t try!  And we aren’t going to build an attractive global model if we keep insisting on the same undemocratic investment provisions – and fail to address labor, environment, and consumer protections in an effective and compelling way.TPP and TTIP are products of the Obama Administration.  And our hope has been that we would see a new template, one that we could support.  Yet so far, we see the same corporate-dominated processes, and, in too many respects, the same fundamental outdated framework for both agreements.Still, I maintain some hope, even for TPP.  After the collapse of the Baucus fast track bill, some new thinking may yet occur in the TPP negotiations.I raise that hope because of the prospect of a more prosperous world in which we have closer ties with Europe and Asia.  The goal of labor is not isolation.  We want a chance to compete with the world, but only if we compete to produce things people are willing to pay for.  We don’t want to see how low we can drive down our living standards.We know what we’re looking for in these agreements.  We want trade agreements to contribute to democratic global economic governance and to promote good jobs, full employment and rising wages.A key element, of course, is strong labor rights protections so that every worker in every country can exercise fundamental human rights on the job – without fear. So we are looking for every trade agreement to require nations to adopt, maintain and enforce the core labor rights – as agreed by the International Labor Organization – and as set out in the ILO core conventions and their related jurisprudence.  These include freedom of association and the right to organize, and bans on child labor, forced labor, and discrimination in employment.The United States and our trading partners must commit to these basic minimum labor standards, and that means going beyond the so-called May 10 standards put in place during the Bush-era.We need enforcement, because no rule makes a difference if it can’t be enforced.  We want effective redress for abuses.We also need to ensure that measures designed to protect workers’ incomes, like intellectual property protections, don’t harm the global poor.  IP protections—which should promote innovation and serve the public interest—are critical to creating and maintaining jobs.  And the U.S. should make sure that other countries respect the innovative work of American artists, actors, writers and inventors.  Yet our government should never use free trade deals to limit access to life-saving drugs.  A people-centered trade agreement won’t provide special appeal and intervention rights for big Pharma under the guise of promoting trade.But formal labor rights are only part of the story.  We alsoneed rules—enforceablerules of international trade that level the playing field—to protect legitimate domestic regulations and prevent unfair trade.The most important element of a level playing field is effectively addressing currency manipulation. This happens constantly.  Countries manipulate the value of their currency to give an unfair advantage to their exports and to shield their domestic markets from competition.  TPP and TTIP must include enforceable mechanisms to address currency manipulation.But those are only the first steps.Trade rules cannot become a backdoor attack on the very idea of a public sector, a public sector that does core public functions like providing social insurance, including health care, infrastructure and education, and regulating economic activity in the public interest.Our governments must be able to act in a time of economic crisis to protect and create jobs.That’s why trade agreements must not interfere with procurement policies like Buy America, and “buy-state” and “buy-local” policies.  It’s vital to democracy that government bodies at every level should be able to stimulate their economy, to ensure the purchase of recycled products, to ensure that labor rights are respected and to promote living wages.We live in a globalized economic environment, and one where the need for rules that protect people and the planet is growing.  We simply cannot afford trade rules that push in the other direction, that make the global economy a free fire zone for corporate power, or make it impossible to act effectively to address profound challenges like climate change.All of these ideas together would put our democratic rights at the center of our economic policies and our trade agreements. Otherwise, we have the NAFTA model thinly disguised tools to increase corporate profits by poisoning workers, polluting the environment and hiding information from consumers.When a company turns the public interest on its head by claiming that it has a right to hide information—instead of a consumer having a right to know—we know trade policy has gone too far.  And yet that is exactly what many global corporations argue when they fight labeling for dolphin-safe tuna, country of origin for beef, or to avoid labeling genetically modified ingredients.  These are tough issues—and should be decided by citizens in a democratic fashion, not behind closed doors by trade negotiators or private arbitrators.In the talks with the EU, the large banks in both economies are trying to use the agreement to weaken financial regulation.It’s appalling that the global megabanks are trying to deregulate through trade agreements—it has nothing to do with trade and everything to do with avoiding responsible behavior.  Instead, financial services provisions of future trade agreements must guarantee the rights of nations to institute capital controls and stabilize the financial system, to protect consumers and depositors.  Ultimately, we cannot have a virtuous cycle of rising incomes and investment in the global economy if that global economy continues to be dominated by financial interests.Just as critical is the case of our environment.  Climate policy must be a part of trade policy. Trade deals must recognize and respect democratic decisions about the use of green procurement and resource conservation.  Climate change is a real threat, and it cannot be completely solved by national action.  Trade agreements must provide border adjustments so that trading partners who act to protect the environment and reduce emissions responsibly are not punished through global trade and investment shifts.  Without border adjustments, attempts to deal with climate change in one country will be counter-productive—adding to carbon emissions by pushing economic activity toward more carbon-intensive economies.And yet U.S. trade policy is completely disconnected from U.S. climate policy.  Until U.S. trade policy is included as part of U.S. climate policy, it is hard to see how we will either act effectively on climate or enact public-spirited trade laws.Finally, the next generation of trade agreements must be ironclad.  They can’t include escape hatches, such as allowing imports from countries that don’t comply with the agreements’ standards to be treated as if they were produced under the rules of the agreement.  That means there must be strong rules of origin, otherwise we reward the most unscrupulous outsourcing companies over workers and our communities.If there is one thing we have learned in the 20 years since NAFTA and the original Fast Track, it’s that to achieve any of these measures, trade agreements must be negotiated in an open, democratic and accountable manner.Trade deals that affect jobs and wages, health care and food security and electricity rates affect us all, and we need to be able to engage citizens to promote, amend or defeat them.We have that chance with all other legislation—at committee mark-up, when it hits the House floor and when it goes to the Senate.  Why can’t we do the same for trade deals?  Why do deals like these need to be negotiated in secret?  It is hard to avoid the feeling that the answer is simple:  No one outside of Washington would support the agreements that have been done under the outdated FTA model.  But this time we are not going to be fooled.As of today, the American labor movement continues to engage in a dialogue with the Obama Administration, with leaders in Congress of both parties and with labor movements and governments around the world in the hope that we can make the TPP and the TTIP into agreements that advance genuine broad-based global prosperity.But make no mistake about it, old-style trade deals that put Wall Street first and workers last are goners, no matter what kind of rhetoric their advocates toss around.We are ready to stand with President Obama in realizing the vision of global economic growth and equity.  But first he has to decide if that is the vision that will animate his trade policies.

395,Trumka to Harvard Business School: Move America Forward,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-harvard-business-school-move-america-forward,2-27-2014,"Thank you Rosabeth [Moss Kanter], it is a pleasure for me to be here today with you, Secretary Foxx and Tom Donohue.  I also want to express my appreciation to the Harvard Business School and to Dean Nohria and Professors Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin for all you have done in recent years to spark a conversation about public investment and American competitiveness.You know, we did not become the world’s largest economy just by good luck.  We have never been the world’s most populous country or the largest country in land area.  Our economy became the most productive in the world in substantial part because we made massive, smart investments in public goods at the right times. First in canals and ports, then in railroads, and in universal telephone and telegraph service.  Then we built an interstate highway system and an unparalleled airport system that knit our country together as no country our size had ever been before.Government was not a bystander in this process.  And neither was business.  Business’ support for public investment by government was key to making the 20thcentury the American century.  But no nation can live off its past.  And unfortunately, that is literally what we are doing.  We have been coasting on those investments for decades.The American Society of Civil Engineers’ most recent report rates our nation’s infrastructure a D+, and they say it would cost $3.6 billion dollars to bring our infrastructure up to par.  That’s up from $2.2 billion just four years earlier.  And understand, this is just the deferred maintenance on our infrastructure inheritance.Some of the examples of the deficiencies are stunning, penny wise and pound foolish.  25% of our bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.  42% of major urban highways are congested, costing business and citizens over $100 billion per year.  The FAA estimates that airport delays and congestion cost the nation $22 billion in 2012.That’s what the experts here at home say when they look at all the pieces of our infrastructure from the bottom up.  And the picture is no better when business leaders are asked about how the U.S. stacks up internationally.The most recent World Economic Forum competitiveness report ranked our roads 18th in the world, down from 11th five years ago.  On railroads we are 17th.  On ports, 16th.  On air transport, 18th.  Middle of the pack and falling?  The United States?  This is simply not acceptable.    Because for America’s working people, these numbers spell economic disaster.  Any strategy we might pursue to achieve competitive advantage as a nation will require world-class infrastructure.  In a world of growing trade and growing competition, inferior infrastructure means long-term economic decline.   I can tell you that our competitors are not standing still, something I saw on a recent trip to China. The Chinese high-speed rail system is nothing short of amazing. The most amazing thing about it is that not too many years ago, both the U.S. and China committed to building high-speed rail. Today, the Chinese system carries more passengers than the U.S. domestic airline industry. The U.S. system does not exist—there is not a single mile of high-speed rail in this country.Near Shanghai, I visited the Yangshan Deep Water port, the world’s largest and busiest container port.  In 2001, nothing was there but a sleepy fishing village.  But the Chinese move fast.  The first phase of the project opened in 2004, and by 2013 China had accomplished its goal of having the world’s largest port.To get to the port, I traveled on a 20-mile-long, six-lane bridge.  The bridge was completed in two and half years and employed close to 6,000 workers.  That’s what we’re up against.If the United States does not act, we will fall further behind.And we must understand the scale of the real need.  We should be investing hundreds of billions more a year in infrastructure.  Over 10 years we need trillions more in infrastructure investment than our current trend line.  And most of that investment will have to be funded with public dollars.  There is no shortcut.But in the face of all these needs and the political paralysis in Washington, those of us concerned about our country’s future must have priorities.  The most pressing priority is to authorize and fund a new surface transportation act.The Highway Trust Fund is going broke, projected to be out of money by September. Failure to act will mean our transportation system will decay further, construction workers will stay on the bench, supply chain and transit workers will lack steady work and our economic competitiveness will be diminished.Surface transportation legislation is the most important jobs legislation Congress considers on a recurring basis.  Each $1 billion in federal funding generates 35,000 jobs, and employment in the construction sector is still down by 1.6 million compared to before the recession.We must find the political will to pass a multi-year solution, funded through a user fee that is adequate to meet the needs.  The AFL-CIO supports increasing the gas tax, or some variation of it, because at this late hour it is the only credible solution, and it maintains our user fee-based system.  Tom and I recently testified before the Senate on this matter, and Chair Boxer told us she favors a 5- or 6-year authorization.  The AFL-CIO would be very supportive of something along those lines.Once we get past the emergency of the surface transportation funding crisis, the AFL-CIO supports a broad investment agenda in all aspects of our nation’s public goods—transportation and energy and communications infrastructure, our aging municipal water systems, and our schools at every level.  We need public goods that meet the needs of the 21st century—that tackle the challenge of climate change, that place us as a nation in the technological lead—not in catch-up mode.  This will require a highly skilled, productive workforce.  Union-based apprenticeships stand ready to meet this need for as large an infrastructure program as the nation can imagine.So we must find a way to expand and modernize our urban and regional transit systems.  Rising ridership and falling funding are not compatible, and the need to connect workers with jobs is growing.We need smooth, efficient and seamless connectivity between one mode of transportation and another.  Our air transportation system is running on outdated technology, our ports are scrambling to prepare for the Post Panamax cargo ships that will be the new world standard and high-speed rail must become a reality, not a pipe dream.Our nation has two choices.  One is to move forward, invest in America and lead the 21st century.Or, we can look back, reminisce about how great we were and lament that America could not find the political will to invest in ourselves.I am truly heartened by the partnership the AFL-CIO has with the Chamber of Commerce on infrastructure.  But for that partnership to succeed in an era of political extremism and gridlock, it will require real passion on all of our parts—the Chamber and the federation, individual companies and unions at the national and at the state and local levels—and institutions like the Harvard Business School. I can only speak for the AFL-CIO—but I pledge to you we are ready to work together with business, government—all of us—and to bring all the passion and determination we have to this effort.Because we intend to be successful.  Labor, business and the American public, left to right, we can come together and build a competitive 21st century America.  And we have no time to lose. Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

396,Trumka Outlines Global Apprach to Growth ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-outlines-global-apprach-growth,2-27-2014,"Seven years have passed since the great financial crisis began in early 2007, and that was merely the opening of a profound economic crisis that is not over. This meeting is of great importance because it is a serious effort by one of the key international institutions charged with preventing just this type of crisis, the OECD, and one of the world’s great philanthropic institutions, the Ford Foundation—to meet the intellectual challenge posed by this crisis to the conventional economic wisdom of the past 30 years -- what Pope Francis calls “the sacrilized workings of the prevailing economic system.”So I want to commend Angel Gurria for his leadership, and Darren Walker for his willingness to join in this effort.  But then I want to challenge you to go deeper.Because it is easy to have a conversation about inclusive growth that presumes our basic pre-crisis ideas about how the world economy works still are valid, but we just need to be a bit more humane about the way they are implemented.  This approach treats the crisis we are still living through as something that just happened, like a meteor hitting earth.The reality is that the crisis was the logical consequence of the key economic ideas of the past several decades.  The idea that inequality promotes growth.  The idea that deregulated financial markets both created value and had no effect on macroeconomic stability.  The idea that destroying workers’ rights and bargaining power improves labor markets.  The idea that national economies are somehow decoupled from each other, instead of being mutually interdependent.  The idea that equality of opportunity can coexist with radical inequality of wealth and income, as if the child of a Walmart worker and a Walmart family heir have an equal chance to go to Harvard.Where did these ideas lead?  Even before the crisis, aggregate positive national growth numbers disguised a reality of falling incomes for a majority of the population—and nowhere more so than in the United States, the epicenter of the crisis.In the United States, between 1997 and 2008, before the crisis hit the labor markets, all the income gains in our economy went to the top 10% of households.  Not some, not a lot—all.  The wages of the lower 90% of the workforce fell.This is the result of a generation of policies that destroyed workers’ bargaining power, and so dramatically increased inequality.  The harm that was done is not incidental.  These policies harmed the vast majority of our population. And it should be no surprise to anyone that the imposition of these same ideas post-2008 in Greece and Spain and Ireland have produced the same horrifying results.In contrast, Germany, with strong labor market institutions, weathered the economic crisis with modest unemployment, and Brazil, which pursued policies designed to strengthen labor market institutions, reduced poverty and inequality during the same period.  And even China, which has perhaps the world’s highest level of inequality, responded to the economic crisis with massive public works, and largely avoided the prolonged mass unemployment the U.S. has suffered.Of course, Germany and China at the same time have contributed significantly to overall global economic stagnation through their reliance on export-led growth and the impact of that strategy on the larger global economic environment. It’s clear that rethinking our ideas about the relationship between growth and inequality is no small matter.  This rethinking must be at the center of policymaking and economic thinking, not   an exercise on the margins.And this rethinking is a huge political challenge, too.  Because the reality is that inequality feeds on itself.  Once a society reaches a certain level of inequality, the winners can rig the rules for the next round of the game.  The tax laws, the labor laws, the banking laws and, most importantly, the laws of the political process itself.But—as all of you here clearly recognize—the challenge of inclusive growth is a global challenge.  I am here with you in my role as both president of the AFL-CIO and president of the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD, representing all the unions of the OECD countries.  In that role I am acutely aware that the OECD countries do not make up the world.  Policies that promote inclusive growth must include the developing world as well as the big emerging market countries and the developed world, and they must address new threats such as climate change as well as age-old challenges of economic justice. So what would a comprehensive global approach to inclusive growth look like?It would have three pillars.  Investment.  Jobs.  Incomes.Investment.  Billions of people in the developing world are unconnected from the formal, regulated economy and live without the basics of modern life.  This is a problem fundamentally of inadequate public investment and inadequate labor standards, and the consequences are both blighted lives and inadequate global demand.  In the developed world, there is a similar problem of an aging and technologically outdated infrastructure that is leading to the erosion of the foundations of broad-based prosperity in many developed countries, and threatening our ability as a planet to stop climate change. Investing in public infrastructure is a way of creating livable cities, instead of massive slums, and would have the added benefit of creating jobs.  Here in New York, and in Los Angeles and Chicago, and in other great American cities, the labor movement is working with the business community and with community groups to forward this investment agenda city by city.  But we need national and international policy support.  Jobs.  There will never be inclusive growth as long as we treat unemployment as a distasteful afterthought, not to be mentioned in polite company.  Ending mass unemployment is now, as it was in the Great Depression, the prerequisite for healthy economies and healthy societies.  Because there will never be income growth as long as we have mass unemployment. Incomes.  But even with a massive jobs program, growth will not be inclusive growth so long as the global economy has no meaningful labor standards and workers lack bargaining power.  The lack of workers’ bargaining power in both developed and developing countries has been a key driver of major global imbalances, and income stagnation and even decline in many countries.But inclusive growth should have something more—a social and moral dimension that speaks to indefensible practices like mass incarceration and the consignment of immigrants to second-class status in many of the world’s economies.In the end, any effort to put the global economy on the right track must deal with each of these issues, and must do so consistently.  It is not possible to have inclusive growth while pursuing austerity policies or attacking workers’ bargaining rights in the name of “flexibility” At a time when demand is greatly depressed and unemployment levels are at new highs, labor market deregulation simply condemns many more workers to join the ranks of the unemployed.Consistency and seriousness about inclusive growth will not be easy.  Turning away from what Pope Francis calls “the economy of exclusion and inequality” will mean challenging the political economy of concentrated wealth.  But there is no other path to prosperity than shared prosperity.   Thank you.

397,Trumka: We Must Be Pro-Job and Pro-Environment,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-we-must-be-pro-job-and-pro-environment,2-10-2014,"Good morning and thank you, Dave [Foster]. I’m honored to be here with you all, and to say a few words on behalf of the 12.5 million working men and women of AFL-CIO unions.Today we are focused on the biggest issues facing our society—the intertwined challenges of an endangered global climate and our nation’s endangered prosperity. We must solve both those challenges, and we must solve them at the same time.Why? They must be solved together not just because it’s the right thing to do, which it is, but because if we don’t solve them both, we aren’t going to solve either of them.Runaway climate change and the threat of global climate instability endanger not only prosperity, but human civilization.  That’s a fact we dare not ignore.  But we must face the political and the economic realities preventing us from action to stop climate change as clearly as we must look at the science. So today I want to talk to you about two realities we must face, understand and challenge.  The first has to do with inequality, and the way inequality prevents action.  And the second is trade, and how trade policies will undo everything we seek to achieve if we don’t change the way our trade policies deal with carbon emissions.President Obama rightly says that inequality is the defining issue of our time.  It is also the key to the climate fight.  Inequality erodes the basic sense that we are all in this together, and that together we must meet the terrible threat of climate change.  But we did not become unequal by accident.For more than 30 years, powerful people have made economic decisions in this country with the clear purpose of lowering the wages and diminishing the economic security of working people.  Policymakers decided to engage with the global economy through trade deals whose real purpose was not trade, but empowering and enriching multinational corporations.  The ultimate result has been downward pressure on wages and consumer and environmental standards. Corporate leaders took apart the pension system, with the help of pliant politicians.  Other politicians chose tax cuts over investing in our future, and the result is a D+ infrastructure and a public education system drained of resources and under attack by the power of private wealth.Let me tell you just one fact that pretty much says it all.  I recently returned from a trip to China.   In the last few years, China and the U.S. both committed to build high-speed rail networks.  But starting in 2010 the U.S. chose the path of fiscal austerity, while China created jobs through public investment.  Today, the U.S. has not a single mile of high-speed rail, while China’s high-speed rail system carries as many passengers as the entire domestic U.S. airline system.Today in the U.S., five years after the financial-sector meltdown, corporate profits are up, the stock market is way up and median family income is down 4%.  Just last week, a New York Times article explained how big corporations are adjusting their business models to a nation in which the middle class is disappearing.That’s not a recipe for convincing the main-street American public to support more big changes that affect the whole economy.Friends, the challenge of climate change can only be solved when we find a formula based on clean energy that also meets the real needs of regular people in their everyday lives—our need for decent work and pay, for access to energy and water, for healthy communities, food security and so much more.It is not good enough to simply call for an end to carbon emissions—we have a responsibility to think carefully about how to actually make change. And I am here to say that the discussion must begin with dialogue and negotiation with those whose lives and communities, health care and pensions are bound up with carbon-based fuels.Simply demanding that plants, industries and projects be stopped and shut down—that poisons the well politically. People who want to stop climate change must engage with the people whose lives and livelihoods are at stake here and now, and we must join together for positive, job-creating approaches, or we will all fail.Real leadership means finding tens of billions of real dollars to fund both investment and just transition.  The alternative is the continued politics of stalemate and inaction.Consider one example.  The main pension for retired coal miners—covering over 100,000 people—needs an additional $2 billion to meet its obligations.  Any workable, equitable path forward on climate includes making sure those miners and their families get what they earned through a lifetime of backbreaking, dangerous work.Now maybe $2 billion sounds like a lot of money.  But it is literally less than the one-year increase in wealth for many of our nation’s billionaires in 2013. This is not a question of what we can and cannot afford to do as a society—this is a question of what we choose to do or not do. I know my friends from the environmental movement here today agree, because of the tremendous support the environmental community gave to the fight to hold Patriot Coal, Peabody Coal and Arch Coal to the promises they made to the men and women who made them rich. As someone who began his working life in a coal mine, that support means the world to me, and I thank you on behalf of coal miners everywhere who spent their working lives in hard, dangerous work and struggle today to maintain their health and a modest retirement.But this fight has just begun, and wrapped up in it is the question of whether we can as a nation, as a democracy, take on the threat of climate change.Because my friends, it doesn’t have to be this way.  There is an alternative to injustice and tragedy.  There are many, many pro-job and pro-environment investments that take us down the path to a cleaner, more prosperous future, and together we can make them a reality.Our nation has the technology to reduce methane leaks in our natural gas system, and to create good, family-supporting jobs doing it. That’s why the AFL-CIO and the BlueGreen Alliance have formed a partnership called Repairing America’s Aging Pipelines (ReCAP), to do the work on the ground to get these programs moving.  We need more ideas like this—more ideas that create jobs, make our economy more competitive and fight climate change.We have the technology to reduce building emissions by up to half, and to put millions of people to work in the process.  At the AFL-CIO, we are completing a retrofit of our headquarters, financed by the pension fund of the working men and women of the Electrical Workers.  There is no reason other than the dysfunction of our financial system that we can’t retrofit every large building in America.But as much progress as we can make in the United States, the reality is that our climate is a global public concern.  Moving emissions from one country to another doesn’t help.Now I know a lot of people in this room have been focused these last few weeks on fighting for a new trade model, and fighting to stop yet another fast track to more NAFTA-style trade deals.And I know many people in this room are aware that language in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement threatens to undermine our ability to protect the environment in our country and globally.But the stakes are actually much higher.While we have much to do in the United States, the reality is that our economy is far more energy efficient in the way we produce goods and services than many of our major trading partners.  For example, we run our largest trade deficit with China.  China emits more than four times as much global-warming pollution per dollar of output as we do. That means if we make carbon-based energy expensive in the United States, but have no trade rules that regulate the carbon intensity of our imports, all we will do is drive our industry to countries like China.  The net result will be not just job loss in the U.S., but higher net global emissions. So how can we possibly enter into trade agreements like the TPP or the Bilateral Investment Treaty with China that do nothing to discipline carbon emissions? Why is the U.S. Trade Representative not pulling on the same end of the rope as the rest of the U.S. government?Why is the U.S. Trade Representative negotiating an environmental chapter that doesn’t address our biggest environmental threat?Why is the U.S. Trade Representative not a participant in the interagency group on climate?And why are we negotiating more trade agreements with inadequate labor rights language and special legal rights for corporations?  More NAFTAs will only further erode the public’s confidence in our government, making meaningful action on climate more and more difficult.My friends, we often talk about climate deniers.  But today we are effectively denying climate change exists with the way the rules of the global economy are being written. Together, the labor and environmental movements must demand a new trade model, a trade model that fights climate change.  Instead of the false promise that we can outsource our carbon emissions, we need a comprehensive approach to stopping climate change across our economy and across the world economy, an approach that puts us on the right path on climate, jobs and energy.We need to think big because the problems are big. We must act based on a clear understanding of how the politics and economics of climate change interact with the politics and economics of a world that is now, in truth, in its seventh year of economic crisis. The obstacles to effective action to stop runaway climate change are not scientific or technical—they are political.  The obstacles to action can be found in the myth that there is no such thing as climate change, in the delusion that in a democratic society elites can make working people bear all the costs of change, and finally in the myth that it is possible to do anything about carbon emissions if there are no border adjustments in our trade agreements.We can overcome these political obstacles.  Government can make private actors internalize externalities by putting a price on carbon.  And government can prime the technology pump by investing in innovation.  Or government – our government -- can do nothing, and nothing will happen.I am here on behalf of the American labor movement to tell you we remain committed to the task of stopping runaway climate change.  This is not easy for us.  For millions of workers in the U.S., our livelihoods, our families, our communities are at stake—not decades from now, but right now.  We need to act together, to find common ground, to make the kind of effort we once made to win world wars, to find solutions that speak to the hopes and aspirations of working and middle-class Americans -- and we must shed the illusion that some other path will work.The BlueGreen Alliance is about finding that common ground, about thinking big, about fighting unemployment and about fighting climate change.  I am pleased and honored to be on this path with you.  There is no other path to prosperity for us, our children and our grandchildren.Thank you.

398,Shuler: America Succeeds When Women Succeed,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-america-succeeds-when-women-succeed,2-7-2014,"Thank you, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson-Lee, Keith Ellison, Raul Grijalva, Garbriela Lemus for your leadership and the work of the Progressive Congress…and thank you to all our good friends in Congress and our progressive partners. It’s great to be here in Philly – on a stage with some of the change makers “sheroes” I admire most—naturally, they’re women -- Saru Jayaraman, Rep. Edwards and, of course, Leader Pelosi – and the biggest thrill is to be here representing women who are members of our country’s labor unions—women who know the value of “leaning in”…collectively. That’s what unions are all about—coming together for strength in numbers. It’s what makes union women an especially important part of our progressive movement. And it’s what today is all about—bringing our strength as women together to make America better.Dr. Lemus asked me to come talk about how unions help women achieve economic equality. What is the “union difference?”Well, there are so many – but let me just touch on three ways.And I’ll start with what’s easy. Unions make a difference for women in dollars and cents—$222, to be exact. That’s how much more the typical woman in a union job makes in a week compared with a woman in a nonunion job. $222 every week. And what about the wage gap between men and women? We all talk about women making about 77 cents to every man’s dollar, right? Even more of a gap for women of color – well, with union women are 91 cents on average – the gap being about 9 cents – still not equal, but a whole lot closer than the gap between men and women overall. (I always say, the best way to get pay equity is a union contract!).And, of course, unions aren’t just about higher wages for individual women. When enough women have bargaining power in an industry, it pushes up wages throughout entire industries where women predominate: nursing and teaching, for example. Those jobs help build the middle class. And women in unions bargaining together overtime made those jobs into careers that could support a family.With most of our country’s future job growth expected in low-wage occupations, think of the difference it could make if more women in jobs like homecare and hospitality could bargain collectively. That’s why the work Saru is doing charting new pathways for collective power is so important!That brings me to the second way unions make a difference for women – and it’s how we are able to shape what goes on in real workplaces all across the country.Women who can bargain collectively aren’t settling for the “Mad Men” environment President Obama joked about in his State of the Union address. Women with bargaining agreements are blazing trails on family-friendly policies that allow women to rise—retirement security, flexible schedules, paid family leave and paid sick leave.I’m sure you all know this—nearly 40 million people in this country do not have a single day of paid sick leave. Not one day! No woman—no man, either—should ever be put in the position of having to choose between her livelihood and staying home for a day with the flu—or because her child or a sick spouse or her elderly parent needs her. Surely in 2014, America’s women—like women in almost every other advanced nation on this planet—should be able to meet their responsibilities to their families, their jobs and themselves.And now for the third way unions make a difference – and it’s familiar to everyone in this room – and that’s in our politics. You all can probably appreciate the union difference when it comes to electing progressive leaders and holding them accountable. We’re not shy! We’re proud of making our voices heard – and you know that the harder our elected leaders and candidates work for us, the harder we work for them!And something that’s not talked about as much – but makes all the difference -- is the voice we have when we come together—a voice on the job to demand respect for the knowledge we possess … and a voice for legislative and political change. The power that comes from standing up and working together on a common goal.And those voices aren’t abstract or intangible. We can count them. 6.5 million. That’s the number of women in the labor movement – about ½ our membership.And now imagine 6.5 million women speaking together on the economy. On everything from fair wages to paid family and medical leave to economic policy and comprehensive immigration reform. That’s what we’ve got in the labor movement. 6.5 million women. Fun fact: the union movement is actually the largest women’s organization in the country.And now let’s imagine even more people joining in the conversation on economic security – all 12.5 million AFL-CIO union members. And then let’s amplify that movement – building the voice for working people – by joining with workers all around the country, inside and outside unions – from steelworkers to waitresses -- with community partners and political allies -- standing together with one collective voice on the economy.That’s our goal – collective action: so that workers voices can be heard in every workplace, every community, at every level of government.That’s a good goal, right? I think we can all get behind that.And what are those voices calling for?Policies to tackle income inequality. Everybody, from President Obama to the Pope to Beyoncé, is talking about income inequality. But what you don’t hear much about is where it came from. Income inequality is not an act of God or of nature. It’s the result of deliberate policy decisions—bad decisions, inspired by the 1%. But…good policy, led by the rest us of, can actually turn income inequality around.It’s the only way we can get to prosperity for all—women, men, families, responsible employers, communities, people of color, LGBTQ sisters and brothers. All of us.Isn’t that the American Dream?If we’re going to make the American Dream truly available to ALL, we need an all-out, long-term campaign to increase the wages of America’s working people—starting by raising the minimum wage. And that includes the tipped minimum wage, which hasn’t been raised since 1991—the woman who served you today may be making a base wage of just $2.13 an hour.Nobody should work hard every day and still be unable to support his or her family. I’m talking especially about women … because women are two-thirds of minimum wage workers.If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation, it would be $10.75 an hour today. If it had kept up with the raises of the top 1%, it would be over $28.And yet we cannot get 218 members of the U.S. House of Representatives to vote for a $10.10 minimum wage—which is STILL too low! Leader Pelosi, I know you share the frustration – my hope is that this issue fuels the fire in November so we can elect more working family friendly candidates to help you in Washington.And paid sick days, paid family and medical leave, and fair scheduling are part and parcel of raising wages in the modern age. We’re all working more, families are stretched thin – and we need policies that provide support for what families need.And, of course, there still are not enough jobs—one job for every three people who want desperately to work is not good enough. Prosperity for all means full employment—that goal should be hard-baked into our economic policy. What is more fundamental to the economic strength of a nation than jobs for its people?The most immediate thing we need our Congress to do now—today—is restore emergency unemployment aid for the people who have been searching for jobs for many months…even years. The Republicans went off to their comfortable holidays at the end of last year, leaving 1.3 million jobless workers without a lifeline—and these numbers grow every week. It’s unconscionable. It’s immoral. It’s un-American.We can do better than this. We need Congress to act on these things now.Not to mention what working women and men need tomorrow, and next year, and for our children’s future: public investment to fix our infrastructure and create jobs; protecting and expanding Social Security benefits; fair trade agreements that help rather than hurt the working women and men of our nations and others; fixing broken immigration system; and of course, promoting the right to come together and bargain collectively with employers to build better futures and a stronger economy.In closing, I’d like to remind you of the worker’s voices, but specifically, women’s voices that have been raised in the past year. The voices of domestic workers who’ve come together for clear standards. The voices of restaurant workers for paid sick days and a livable minimum wage. The voices of fast food workers for economic justice. The voices of Walmart workers demanding a way out of poverty. Pretty powerful stuff --Think about the courage they showed. They don’t have a union protecting them yet they’re standing up to McDonalds when they really need those jobs. They’re standing up to the world’s largest employer and the Walton family.If they can do that, surely we can stand up together to the Koch brothers. To ALEC. To all those who say low wages and shattered expectations are just the way it has to be.This is America. We can do better. And when women do better, America does better.Thank you.And now, let me introduce someone who is working night and day for the women and men in the restaurant industry and those who aspire to improve it.Saru Jayaraman is the co-founder and co-director of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United and director of the Food Labor Research Center at University of California, Berkeley.ROC now has 10,000 members in 19 cities nationwide. Let’s hear more from Saru….  © 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Shuler
399,Trumka at U.N.: We Must Act on Climate Change,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-un-we-must-act-climate-change,1-15-2014,"Good morning and thank you, Tim [Wirth], I’m honored to be here with you all, and to say a few words on behalf of the 12.5 million working men and women of AFL-CIO unions.In the two years since I was last with you, much has changed---but one thing remains constant.  And that is the simple truth that halting runaway climate change is about investment.  Lots of investment, the International Energy Agency says $36 trillion in new investment by 2050.  CERES, in its Clean Trillion report, says $1 trillion a year by 2030.  So we in this room remain central actors in this play, but as I will discuss more in a moment, we are not the only central actors.But first, a word about the terrible cost of inaction and denial.When I was a coal miner, the company I worked for often subscribed to a convenient version of scientific reality.  You see, it was expensive to shore up the mine tunnels safely, so the company wanted to defy gravity.  It cost money to properly ventilate the mine so it didn’t fill with explosive gas, so they liked to tell us the air was fine, when it wasn’t.And most of all they told us it was healthy to breathe coal dust, when we knew it was killing each of us, and our families.But of course, the real laws of science always win—tunnels without supports cave in, mines filled with methane explode, and miners’ lungs filled with coal dust, have no room for oxygen. Climate change is the same.  While we play the politics of denial, physics is relentless.Already unprecedented storms have devastated coastal areas across the globe—including New York itself.  Climate change and extreme weather could cost the world more than 3% of global domestic product by 2030.And if we don’t act, the longer term forecast is for something much worse, perhaps within the lifetime of our children and grandchildren—warming at levels so great that literally no one knows what might happen—unknown unknowns.  We are passengers on this earth, and we cannot change planes.  If we don’t act, our Earth may become the equivalent of a high altitude plane without a pressurized cabin.  It can fly just fine, but it can’t carry us.We have a responsibility to act, and the events of the last two years teach us action will require more than a basic understanding of climate science.  We must understand how the politics and economics of climate change interact with the politics and economics of a world that is now, in truth, in its seventh year of economic crisis.  It is not good enough to simply call for an end to carbon emissions—we have a responsibility to think carefully about how to actually make change.This is our responsibility, because our climate, more than almost anything else in the world, is a public good.  And the reality is that private investors, despite all the desire and good will in the world, will not invest sufficiently in reducing carbon emissions without public policies—carrots and sticks—designed to make it happen. Getting those policies enacted is a political task, one that in the U.S. is made incredibly difficult by the recent experience of the average American family.  My friends, let me outline for you three things that are at the heart of why the last two years have been so disappointing, in terms of action on climate: unemployment, austerity, and inequality.First, jobs and unemployment.  The official unemployment rate in the U.S. is just under 7%, down from 10% at its peak, but still higher than at the worst of the 2001 recession.  And in many states dependent on carbon-based fuel production, unemployment is even higher, and Congress continues to fail to extend unemployment benefits for the millions still looking for work. Worldwide, the picture is worse—the International Labor Organization estimates there are over 200 million people unemployed worldwide—a number greater than the entire U.S. workforce.  Unemployment breeds desperation, and people without work are easy prey, for those who will tell them that stopping climate change means fewer jobs.Second, austerity.  The richest countries in the world, the countries with the greatest capacity to act to address runaway climate change, have spent the last three years following economic policies that reduce public investment, and make unemployment worse.  You couldn’t come up with public policies more destructive to any effort to address climate change—both in terms of the economics and the politics. There is no way to stop runaway climate change without massive public investment.  Yet politicians and economists promote austerity, while wringing their hands about inaction on climate.  Shame on them for their hypocrisy, and their cynical contribution to inaction.Let me tell you just one fact that pretty much says it all.  I recently returned from a trip to China.   In the last few years, China and the U.S. both committed to build high-speed rail networks.  But starting in 2010 the U.S. chose the path of fiscal austerity, while China created jobs through public investment.  Today, the U.S. has not a single mile of high-speed rail.  While China’s high-speed rail system carries as many passengers as the entire domestic U.S. airline system.Third, inequality.  As inequality has increased in developed countries, most big changes in the economy have had a negative effect on working families and their communities.  Jobs are lost to free trade.  Public services are diminished.  Pensions are lost to bankruptcy, and our infrastructure is in shambles. Today in the U.S., five years after the financial-sector meltdown, corporate profits are up, the stock market is way up, and median family income is down 4%.  That’s not a recipe for convincing the general public to favor more big changes that affect the whole economy.In the developing world, the moral scandal of extreme poverty exacerbates any attempt to reduce pollution through measures that compromise energy access for people who are both poor and energy-poor.  Citizens in these nations want and deserve solutions to climate change that do not involve cutting off their hopes for a better life.Friends, the challenge of climate change can only be solved when we find a formula based on clean energy that also meets the real needs of regular people in their everyday lives.  Their need for decent work and pay, for access to energy and water, healthy communities, food security and so much more.If we want investors to put trillions of dollars into climate change mitigation and adaptation -- which we clearly need -- the policy and regulatory environment must support those investments.As long as we live in democracies, citizens must have confidence that their needs are going to be met for the public policies to be put in place that will make it possible for investors to invest in the public good of a stable climate.The truth is that the obstacles to effective action to stop runaway climate change are not scientific or technical—they are political.We have the technology to reduce building emissions by 50%.  At the AFL-CIO headquarters, we have deployed many of these technologies in a retrofit project financed by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers National Pension Fund, and we put engineers, carpenters, glazers, electricians, and plumbers to work doing it.  The AFL-CIO Housing Investment Trust has put hundreds of millions of dollars to work retrofitting public housing, creating jobs, saving energy, and saving money.And our nation has the technology to reduce methane leaks across our natural gas production, transmission, and distribution systems, and to create hundreds of thousands of jobs doing it, and the AFL-CIO and the Blue-Green Alliance have formed a partnership to do the work on the ground to get these programs enacted.We also have the example of the U.S. automobile industry.  Almost four years after GM and Chrysler went bankrupt, the U.S. auto industry is turning out fuel-efficient vehicles that are the climate-policy success of our time, getting cleaner every year, and avoiding more greenhouse gasses than any other sector of the economy.And the auto industry is hiring.It’s a remarkable story of investing in America, and creating tens of thousands of production and engineering jobs by making advanced-technology fuel-efficient vehicles.These investments and technological advances didn’t occur in a policy vacuum.  Indeed, they were shaped and encouraged by federal policy.Regulations on fuel economy and tailpipe emissions gave certainty to product plans and reduced the risk of investing the hundreds of billions of dollars it will take to remake the auto industry.Loans and grants by the federal government reduced the cost and risk of investing in the most-cutting edge technology and helped get production up and running in the United States.  And that investment is creating jobs as we speak.That’s the kind of success we need to replicate on a much wider scale.  Good investments creating good jobs.  Investments by government in setting the table and helping industries grow to scale.  Investments by companies innovating and then bringing new products to market.We make the most progress when we find solutions that address both our endangered prosperity and our endangered climate.But we aren’t going to accomplish what we need to one industry at a time.Nothing illustrates this more than the current efforts to regulate the electric power sector in the United States.  There are fierce debates about the economic feasibility of the technologies.  The matter seems likely to stay tied up in court for years.We don’t have that kind of time, and it won’t work anyway.  We can’t possibly succeed with piece-meal policies that pit sector against sector.  The politics of a “stick only” approach are poisonous, and those poisonous politics will embolden climate deniers.We need a comprehensive approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation across our economy.  It has to begin with dialogue and negotiation with those whose lives and communities, health care, and pensions are bound up with carbon-based fuels.But frankly my friends, that kind of discussion is not going to yield fruit until we can break the logjam in Washington, D.C. and in capitals across the globe.  We must push for a comprehensive energy, jobs and climate bill—one that provides the carrots and the sticks that can make change work for working people.  Let me speak candidly, as someone who talks to people on all sides of the increasingly passionate debates around energy policy, about what some key actors need to do if we are going to make progress.First, to environmental activists.  I understand your despair at the lack of action.  But you cannot allow despair to lead you to embrace self-destructive tactics.  Simply demanding that plants, industries and projects be stopped and shut down—that poisons the well politically.You must engage with the people whose lives are at stake and you must be about positive, job-creating approaches, or we will all fail.  And you must stop making the perfect the enemy of the good.  Every source of energy, every technology both creates jobs and has environmental consequences—but only carbon emissions threaten our civilization.  This means technologies some environmentalists don’t like, such as carbon capture and sequestration and nuclear energy, must be part of the solution.To billionaires like Mike Bloomberg who have put up small fractions of their personal wealth to fund campaigns to “end coal,” we say: You are not doing what it will take to be successful.  Running campaigns that can only be interpreted by working families as threats to their livelihoods and their communities actually hurts the chances of meaningful action on climate policy.The smart money should be on a comprehensive approach that includes clean energy, investments in technology and job creation.  That means making sure that fossil-fuel linked communities and sectors are not made to bear the entire cost of change.And that requires real money.  Real leadership means finding tens of billions of real dollars to fund both investment and just transition.  The alternative is the continued politics of stalemate and inaction.Consider one example.  The main pension for retired coal miners—covering over 100,000 people—needs an additional $2 billion to meet its obligations.  Any workable, equitable path forward on climate includes making sure those miners and their families get what they earned through a lifetime of backbreaking, dangerous work.Finally, to business and finance—the world needs your political leadership.  There is no way to break the logjam in Washington around climate and energy and jobs without business leadership.   Business and labor have shown we can work together on immigration and infrastructure.  We can do it on energy, too, and we can build a partnership with the environmental community--but we cannot do it if business stays on the sidelines politically.My message is pretty plain: Those who want to foster and encourage the financial, regulatory and market conditions that will increase the opportunities for profitable investments in new technologies and cleaner energy, please join with us in trying to break the logjam in Washington.Government can make private actors internalize externalities by putting a price on carbon.  And government can prime the technology pump by investing in innovation.  Or government can do nothing, and nothing will happen.But the choice will fundamentally be made outside government.  By business, and investors, workers and environmentalists.  If we choose to act in ways that pit us against each other, we will come closer and closer to the point of no return—not political no return, but physical no return.I am here on behalf of the American labor movement to tell you we remain committed to the task of stopping runaway climate change.  This is not easy for us.  For millions of workers in the U.S., our livelihoods, our families, our communities are at stake—not decades from now, but right now.  We are prepared to make hard decisions and to make sacrifices, but not while the most privileged in our society stand on the sidelines and expect our poorest communities to bear the costs.We need to act together, to find common ground, to make the kind of effort we once made to win world wars, to find solutions that speak to the hopes and aspirations of working and middle-class Americans, and we must shed the illusion that some other path will work.Together, investors, business, labor and environmentalists can -- and we must -- come together to break the political logjam that prevents the progress we so desperately need.Thank you.© 2023 AFL-CIO.

400,Trumka to IBEW: Political Independence Critical ,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-ibew-political-independence-critical,10-2-2013,"Thank you, Jim [Ross], for your kind introduction and also for inviting me to speak here with all of you.We are gathered together at a critical moment for the IBEW, for the AFL-CIO and the entire labor movement—and indeed for working people across America and around the world.Together we are in the process of redefining our unions and our movement—and in doing so I believe we will alter the prospects for working men and women for generations to come. And I am proud to be standing at these historical crossroads with each and every one of you … and with your outstanding leadership … and I want to specifically name your president Ed Hill… as one of the most principled and effective leaders in our movement and in America today.We need strong leaders. You see, here in Washington, we are confronted with politicians who too often see the world as a zero sum game, as if points scored in a government shut-down fight on Capitol Hill actually mean something in and of themselves.Well, I don’t need to tell you regular people are exhausted… by the D.C. gridlock, by the stupid games of the Republican leadership… and yet we can’t tune them out, because we’re the ones who always get hurt.Right now, House Speaker John Boehner is trying to score a political victory while the federal workers who make America run are trying to figure out how to cover the mortgage and fill up the tank without a paycheck…. And while too many Americans are locked out of the services we count on.My friends, I’m not concerned with “wins” for Democratic or Republican politicians. I’d applaud John Boehner if he would lift a finger for working people! I’m telling you, I care about one thing: the state of working families.Brothers and sisters, we are politically independent. We do not… and will not… exist to build any political party or any politician. We are building power for working people. Period.Our independence is more critical today than it ever has been.And let me be frank: I am deeply troubled by the way the Affordable Care Act has been administered. Too many calls seem to have been made in the interests of insurance companies and employers. The law is far from perfect…. And yet the ACA gives millions of America’s families access to quality health care they desperately need.We acknowledge that achievement. And yet… my friends… we will also raise our voices when the law goes astray. And that’s exactly what we’re doing.We will fight anything that hurts working people. We will not be silent. We’ll fight it. We won’t back up or step back… and we will not stand down.Sisters and brothers… friends… at the end of the day, our job is simply to make the lives of people who work better. I think about the regular people all over this country who get up and do a job… who take care of their kids… and who struggle day by day for a better life.And no matter what else, each of your members and every worker in America … every single one of us … deserves basic dignity and respect … and to be able to bargain for a fair reward for the job we do. That should be the baseline.That's what a union does.  We stand together for a better life. That's why we struggle for our rights on the job, and that’s why we’re here in Washington… to carry water for the people back home who don’t want … and maybe can’t even survive … another destructive trade deal like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.We need truly fair trade … and environmental laws that work without punishing working people. And we need true immigration reform… including a safe and workable path to citizenship… so every single worker in America can stand up… with confidence… for his or her rights… and stand together with coworkers… for a voice on the job. We’re done with immigration laws that pit working people against each other and allow corporations a steady supply of workers without papers and without enforceable rights … insecure workers who know immigration enforcement is always just a phone-call away.That’s what we’re fighting for … federal policy to make our working families stronger -- not weaker.I'm going to say that one more time.  Every single one of our legislative fights will strengthen us… all of us. A union stands for all.  That's what makes us strong.My friends, at the AFL-CIO Convention in Los Angeles a few weeks ago, we talked about building community, and reaching out beyond our own members in our communities.  We passed resolutions to strengthen the labor movement at every level… in every city and every state… with new levels of accountability for state federations and labor councils and affiliates.We must make these changes. Nothing is more important to our ability to win good contracts, to gain genuine American living standards, to engage in electoral politics when it matters, and to build real strength in our unions and our communities. They’re all tied together, and they all come back to that one central idea… we’re stronger together. Brothers and sisters, by the end of the AFL-CIO convention, we had a full agenda of change… in three broad areas. The first is growth, innovation and political action.  The second is building shared prosperity in the global economy.  And the last is all about community partnerships and grassroots power.But you know… and I know… the convention was just the beginning.  For the next step, I need your help.  I'm asking for your commitment…. Brothers and sisters, I am not satisfied with a few nice phrases on fancy paper.  It’s time to use the power we have, and the power we’ll build, to improve the lives of working people.  I'm dead serious about that.You see, the truth is… working people are hurting. The American working class is no longer our middle class. You know it. We all live it. This is our shared experience in America today. Everyone who works for a living, works harder, and creates more value, over longer hours, and yet we earn less. Think back over the past 15 years—think of all the work you did, all your co-workers did, all your friends and neighbors and family did.  All of the wage increases over the last 15 years, not some, not most, not the majority, but every single penny, all of it went to the richest 10%. I want you to remember this statistic, because it’s the source of so much pain, and because it’s something we’re going to change.  All of the wage increases over the last 15 years went to the top 10%.  And the incomes of the rest of us—90% of America—went down.  And the incomes that went up the most were those at the top already—the richest 1%.Since 2009, the pay of America’s corporate CEO’s has gone up 40%.  Imagine for a second how strong our families, our communities, and our economy would be if the incomes of ordinary people had increased at that rate.  Think about it.  Forty percent!The 1% bends our rules, corrupts our democracy, and takes all the money.  It's wrong.  It’s un-American.  It's upside down.Sisters and brothers, we are going to turn America right-side up!Everything we do, everything, must be part of our over-arching strategy for winning shared prosperity.  I'm talking about everything we do, from the local to the national level.  What you do.  What I do.  Every day.  If we're not moving the dial, we'd better stop and think about it.  And then do something different.I’m not talking about a silver bullet, or a magic bean.  I'm talking about old-fashioned unionism.  About talking to each other, supporting each other, organizing each other, talking within our movement, and with friends and allies outside the walls of our union halls, to find out what we need from each other, to find out what will make us all grow stronger!  And then, we’ll take action, and move forward together!You know, it doesn’t take but once or twice, standing together, before the strings of our common experience strengthen into the tight bonds of real solidarity.  That’s how we’ll build community.  That’s how we’ll rebuild an America where you don’t surrender your humanity, your dignity and your rights when you go to work.Brothers and sisters… between all of us… we’re going to tear down the barriers. We’ll join with anyone … union, non-union, never-heard-of-union.  We won’t let employers or politicians tell us who’s in our movement and who isn’t. That’s our job, our responsibility.  And we’ll stand and fight, and march, and struggle with every single worker who needs us, because we know solidarity, and we will not be denied!America will understand our willingness to use solidarity, our willingness to stand together.We will let it be known that every worker who stands with us… will have a friend for life, a powerful ally, thousands of friends, millions of friends, who will rise together and march together -- not just when it’s easy, but when it’s hard. Especially when it’s hard.  And the harder is it is, the longer we’ll stand.More than 50 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King spoke to the 4th AFL-CIO Constitutional Convention.  He said:“Powerful forces tell us to rely on the good will, and understanding of those who profit by exploiting us.  They deplore our discontent, they resent our will to organize.”Dr. King knew all about discontent.  He knew all about the will to organize.  He was not a union member, but he was a courageous leader who knew how to break the silence, how to stand together, and how to win together.  And, brothers and sisters, he was as good a friend as any worker could have.  He walked down a line of National Guard bayonets with us.  And he gave his life in Memphis, even though he knew his life was threatened, and he died with our union brothers and sisters, those strong sanitation workers in the city of Memphis who suffered discontent, and who stood up with the will to organize. And I ask you now, who will we stand with?  Who shares our discontent?  Who needs our will to organize? 
We will stand with anyone who needs us.  Dr. King said it then.  America needs it now!We need it now!Everything we’re doing, everything from our growing political independence, to our defense of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps, to our campaign for comprehensive immigration reform and to fix the Affordable Care Act.  All of it has one purpose, one purpose… to build power for working people, for you, and for me, and the rest of the 99%.We’re doing this, because, as my friend Sen. Elizabeth Warren put it, the pundits, and the big corporate lobbyists here in D.C. might be against us, but the American people are on our side.On every issue we care about, our values are America’s values, and our agenda is America’s agenda.We’re working for Wall Street reform.  The far right-wing is fighting it, but the American people are on our side.   More than 80% of the American people are on our side!We’re fighting bad trade, and no one thinks we can win, but the American people are with us, by a margin of four to one! The American public is on our side!We’re working for investments in America’s infrastructure, not millions, not billions, but trillions.  The right-wing politicians in Washington are fighting us, but more than 70% of the American people are on our side!We’re working for education, health care, safe jobs, and an economy that works for the people who work.  Washington says it can’t be done, but the American people are on our side!My friends, we’ll start at the local level, and we’ll build to the national level.  And we’ll keep building, for global prosperity, for good jobs, for justice, and for a sustainable economy here and abroad.We’re going to turn America right-side up, you heard me say it.  We are going to get it done! Keep reaching.  Keep fighting. That’s the key.  That’s what we need to bring out the best in our country, and in ourselves, to build the future we know we can have, we must have, for each of us, for our children and grandchildren.And we will never, never give up.We will always, always go forward.And together we will win, for each other, for our future, for our country.Standing together.  Working together.  Organizing together.  Voting together.  Today.  Tomorrow.  Next month.  Next year.  It’s our legacy.  Yours and mine, sisters and brothers.  Let’s do it!Thank you, and God bless you!  And God bless the work you do!###

401,Trumka to SAG-AFTRA Convention: We Are All Connected,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-sag-aftra-convention-we-are-all-connected,9-26-2013,"Thank you, Ken [Howard], for that generous introduction.  And thank you for inviting me. I'm glad to be here with all of you, for your first convention as SAG-AFTRA.And let me start by recognizing the strategic insight and activism of your leadership -- Ken Howard and Amy Aquino.Brothers and sisters, we’re stronger together – it’s as simple as that.  And one of the major goals across our labor movement is strengthening the power of unions.  I have no doubt that the merger of SAG and AFTRA has built a stronger union.  It is a victory for your combined membership -- and the early results are exciting.One example of your growing strength is the new contract for dancers organizing in the music video industry – it’s new, it’s creative, and it’s about time!  And there are more examples -- your work at American Public Media, and the depth of your penetration in the world of audio books.Don't get me wrong, the job of strengthening our unions and America's working families still has a long way to go before we can take a deep breath and step back.Our goal is, and must always be, to make sure our members, and all people who work hard, even if they don't get the big break, can still live, work, and retire with a good life -- a middle class life -- with dignity.Let me make one more observation about the broad media industries where your members find employment.  Over the past decade and more, the cost of doing business has been increasingly shifted onto performers. I'll give you one example. Today, it’s hard to be an audio performer, without a high-end home studio.Listen, I understand that changing technology has created new openings, and made it possible for your members to outfit a quality home recording studio, with first-rate sound and editing equipment.And I know that a home studio can give a performer flexibility -- but our challenge is to make sure that workers who create value, don't also pay the entire cost of producing that value,  without reaping additional benefits.You see, sisters and brothers, your members create tremendous value.  I'm talking about the stars – yes -- and everyone else who makes it possible for the stars to shine.  We couldn't have the names on the marquee without the artists, the background actors, all the people who absolutely love this business, and whose labor makes possible the joy and wonder I feel, and that all the rest of us in the viewing or listening public feel, when we're transported to another place, or another time, by the magic of the work you do.A few weeks ago, at the AFL-CIO national convention here in Los Angeles, it seemed like everyone I talked to told me of meeting your members while they were hard at work at their day jobs, as wait staff at restaurants, and at retail shops, including one of your members who works occasionally at a cigar shop downtown.  Sisters and brothers, I was proud to learn, the guy from the cigar shop had the opportunity to come to the convention for my keynote speech.That means a lot to me, you see, and not because I like a bigger audience.  The truth is, I spend a lot of time talking about bringing people together so we can build strength for all working people, and I mean it.  I absolutely do.We are all connected.  And we’re stronger when we stand together.Together, we can lead better lives.  All of us. We can be a better country, with better jobs and middle class living standards.  That's what we want.  That's who we are.  We want to live with dignity, have our voice respected, and provide well for our families, our children.We all have dreams, of course we do.  Maybe none have dreams bigger than the dreams of your members.But at the end of the day, your members are like everyone else who works for a living.  They’re workers.  Hard workers, activists, questioners, and no matter what happens, each member, every single one, deserves to be fairly rewarded for the work he or she does.And that's what a union does.  That's why we strengthen our foundations, and prepare for negotiations.  That's why we struggle for our rights on the job, and that includes fighting against right-to-work-for-less, in every state where it encourages workers to freeload off the hard work and organization of others.We'll take on that right-wing assault, so we can improve work for all workers, because we know that unless we make real everyone's rights, none of our rights will be secure.I'm going to say that one more time.  A union stands for all.  That's what makes us strong.And, as a movement, we will not allow the right-wing to pass more laws, to let freeloaders weaken the ability of all workers to bargain for safety on the job, for health care, and retirement, and fair pay.  If they try, we'll fight to defend our rights, and it will only make us stronger!At the AFL-CIO Convention, we talked a lot about building community, about strengthening the labor movement at the local level, and reaching out beyond our own members in our communities.  Nothing is more important to our ability to win good contracts, to gain genuine American living standards, to engage in electoral politics when it matters, and to build real strength in our unions and our communities.  They’re all tied together, and they all come back to one idea – We’re stronger together. My friends, by the time we wrapped up the AFL-CIO convention, we had agreed on a full agenda of change for our movement.  And we focused on three broad areas.  The first is growth, innovation, and political action.  The second is building shared prosperity in the global economy.  And the last is all about building community partnerships and grassroots power.We discussed major plans to translate that agenda into action, and so today we’re looking at how that action will play out.  As a movement, we endorsed a whole bunch of resolutions, but that was just the start of the work.  And I need your help.  I'm asking for your commitment.You see, Brothers and sisters, I’m not satisfied with having a lot of nice phrases on fancy paper.  I want to use the power we have, and the power we’ll build, to improve the lives of working people.  I'm dead serious about that.To tell you the truth, one of our greatest hurdles between where the labor movement is today and where we need to be is isolation.  It's not just us.  Working people all over America are isolated from each other.
You see, the right-wing understands isolation and alienation – they’ve taken advantage of the divisions and insecurity of working people.  They’ve learned to exploit just about every institution in America, to enrich themselves at the expense of the 99%.
 Everything, from the speed and frequency of online stock trades, to gaming Federal Reserve monetary policy, to using tax loopholes, and, yes, bankruptcy laws, too often those institutions have been used for one purpose, to skim profits for a few at the expense of the many.And that’s why it’s not a surprise – but it should make all of us angry -- that the American working class is no longer our middle class.Sisters and brothers, this is our shared experience in America today.  It's not just your members. It's all of us.  Everyone who works for a living, works harde, and creates more value, over longer hours, and yet we earn less.

It's completely backwards, and it’s upside down.Brothers and sisters, we are going to turn America right-side up, with a real working class movement!Everything we do, everything, should be part of our over-arching strategy for winning shared prosperity.

Especially when it’s hard.  And the harder is it is, the longer we’ll stand.More than 50 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King spoke to the 4th AFL-CIO Constitutional Convention.

402,Trumka to TWU Convention: Workers Must Break the Isolation,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-twu-convention-workers-must-break-isolation,9-25-2013,"Thank you, Harry [Lombardo]. I want to congratulate you on winning the presidency of this powerful union.  A union with a proud past and – I can feel it in this room today -- an equally promising future.  I congratulate you on your focus on the future, and thank you all for inviting me to be here.  It's good to be with you all.Harry and I have known each other for years. We’re both part of a fighting Pennsylvania labor movement where we’ve all learned from each other -- and hashed things out when we had to. That’s how we’ve grown stronger together.  And that’s how we’ve supported each other.  Because quite frankly, if we hadn’t talked through our troubles and triumphs, we wouldn’t have known what we could offer each other.I’ll ask you to think about that, and remember that, and do the same.  Learn from each other, talk to each other, because building community starts at home, within the House of Labor and even within our own unions, our own locals, and definitely within our state and local labor movements.Two weeks ago at the AFL-CIO Convention just down the road in Los Angeles, we talked a lot about building community, about strengthening the labor movement at the local level, and reaching out beyond our own members in our communities.  Nothing is more important to our ability to win good contracts, to fight for genuine, American living standards, to engage in electoral politics when it matters, and to build real strength in our unions and our communities. They’re all tied together and they all come back to one idea – We’re stronger together. And, to tell you the truth, one of our greatest hurdles between where the labor movement is today and where we need to be is isolation.  It's not just us. Working people all over America are isolated from each other.It’s time to break the isolation.  That's how solidarity starts.  The corporate right-wing knows how to pressure us, how to pit us against each other, plant seeds of insecurity. We can't react to that pressure by turning against each other, or by closing ourselves off to the outside world.You see, corporate CEOs and Wall Street right-wingers understand isolation and alienation – they’ve taken advantage of our divisions and our insecurity.  They’ve learned to exploit just about every institution in America to enrich themselves at the expense of the 99 percent. Everything from the speed and frequency of online stock trades, to gaming Federal Reserve monetary policy, to using tax loopholes and, yes, bankruptcy laws, too often those institutions have been used for one purpose, to skim profits for a few at the expense of the many.And that’s why it’s not a surprise – but it makes me angry -- when people say, “The American working class is no longer middle class.”  The American working class is no longer middle class. That, brothers and sisters, is our shared experience in America today.  Everyone who works for a living works harder, and creates more value, over longer hours, and yet most of us earn less.

We do the work.  But our pay is down.The 1% bent the rules, corrupted our democracy and took all the money. It's wrong. It’s un-American.  It's completely backwards and it’s upside down.Brothers and sisters, we are going to turn America right-side up, with a real working class movement, a movement that's building right here with the letters T… W… U!I’m not talking about a silver bullet or a magic bean.  I'm talking about old-fashioned unionism. About talking to each other, supporting each other, talking within our movement, and with friends and allies outside the walls of our union halls, to find out what we need from each other, to find out what will make us all grow stronger!

We know solidarity, and we will not be denied!My friends, you know my position on your legislative priorities. I stand with you 100%. You don’t need me to run through it. But I want you to know, that I know and value, the work you and your members do.You make America move.  You make the work of millions of workers possible, as you take people to their jobs in New York City, and San Francisco, and Miami, and so many other cities.You move people and vital goods over our railways and through the air, all over America.
Whatever your job, your work makes a difference, because it takes all of us together to make this whole thing go, and together we will make sure America once again values work – your work and all work, and rewards hard work with fair pay. 
 My friends, by the time we wrapped up the AFL-CIO convention, we had agreed on a full agenda of change for our movement. And we focused on three broad areas. The first is growth, innovation and political action. The second is building shared prosperity in the global economy. And the last is all about building community partnerships and grassroots power.We discussed major plans to translate that agenda into action, and so today we’re looking at how that action will play out.  As a movement, we endorsed a whole bunch of resolutions, but the work has only just begun. And I need your help. I'm asking for your commitment.You see, brothers and sisters, I’m not satisfied with having a few nice phrases on fancy paper.  I want to use the power we have and the power we’ll build to improve the lives of working people. I'm dead serious about that.Everything we do, everything should be part of this over-arching strategy for winning shared prosperity.  I'm talking about everything we do from the local to the national level of the labor movement. What you do.  What I do.  Every day.  If we're not moving the dial, we'd better stop and think about it.  And then do something different.And that’s why I’m asking for your help. I’m asking you to take what you accomplish at your convention, and truly take it to heart.  And then go home dissatisfied, and hungry for action.Why “dissatisfied”?Our unions have proud histories, my friends.  But we can't be satisfied with a legacy.  Our labor movement too often has been defined by our past achievements.  That's not good enough.As a movement – all of us – we can’t be satisfied until we make real change, on the ground, back home in our local communities.I’m asking you to build with me a new legacy, a new heritage to pass on to our children. Help me build on our legacy, instead of being limited by it, to rely on our founding strength and solidarity and values—and use them to build a new working class movement in our time, and for our time -- a movement of, by and for working people.What we need is the willingness to use our solidarity, to stand together, and to let every worker know that whoever marches with us, will have a friend for life, a powerful friend, thousands of friends, millions of friends who will rise together and march together, not when it’s easy, but when it’s hard.  Especially when it’s hard.  And the harder is it is, the longer we’ll stand.Because, brothers and sisters, we do the work of America -- we drive the trains and clean the homes, we write the software and teach the children.  We put the scrubbers on the power plants and the planes in the sky.  We keep the lights on and the water flowing, and, hell, we even deal the cards at the table.  Our movement is as old as our nation, and as new as the immigrant hotel worker, the apprentice, the new teacher walking through that classroom door for her very first day. Whose job is it to build our movement? It's our job. It's on us to build a movement for the 99%.  Not the 11% we are right now.  The 99%.More than fifty years ago Dr. Martin Luther King spoke to the 4th AFL-CIO Constitutional Convention.  He said:“Powerful forces, tell us to rely on the good will and understanding of those who profit by exploiting us.  They deplore our discontent, they resent our will to organize.”Dr. King knew all about discontent.  He knew all about the will to organize.  He was not a union member, but he was a courageous leader who knew how to break the silence, how to stand together and how to win together.  And, brothers and sisters, he was as good a friend as any worker could have. He walked down a line of National Guard bayonets with us.  And then he died in Memphis, even though he knew his life had been threatened, he died with our union brothers and sisters, those strong sanitation workers in the city of Memphis, who suffered discontent, and who acted out the will to organize. And I ask you now, who will we stand with?  Who shares our discontent?  Who needs our will to organize? We will stand with anyone who needs us. Dr. King said it then. America needs it now! We need it now!Everything we’re doing, everything from our growing political independence, to our defense of Social Security, Medicare and food stamps, to our campaign for comprehensive immigration reform with a workable and realistic path to citizenship, all of it has one overarching purpose, to build power for working people, for you and for me and the rest of the 99 percent.We’re doing this, because, as my friend Sen. Elizabeth Warren so eloquently put it, the pundits and the big corporate lobbyists in Washington might be against us, but the American people are on our side.On just about every issue we care about, our values are America’s values, and our agenda is America’s agenda.We’re working for Wall Street reform.  The right-wing Republicans are fighting it, and our politician friends may be nowhere to be found, but the American people are on our side, more than 80% of the American people are on our side!We’re working to raise the minimum wage.  Big business is fighting us, but the American people are with us more than 75% of the American people are on our side!We’re working for investments in America’s infrastructure, not millions, not billions, but trillions.  The Republican majority in Washington is fighting us, but more than 70% of the American people are on our side!We’re working for education, health care, safe jobs and an economy that works for the people who work.  Washington says it can’t be done, but the American people are on our side!My friends, we are going to get it done.  We’ll start at the local level, and we’ll build to the national level.  And we’ll keep building, for global prosperity, for fair trade, for good jobs, justice, and a sustainable economy here and abroad.We’re going to turn America right-side up, you heard me say it.  We are going to get it done!Always, always, keep reaching.  Keep fighting.  Stronger locals.  Globally united! That’s the key. That’s what we need to bring out the best in our country, and in ourselves, to build the future we know we can have, we must have, for each of us, for our children and grandchildren.And we will never, never, give up.We will always, always go forward.And together we will win, for our families, for each other, for our future, for our country. Standing together.  Fighting together.  Organizing together.  Voting together.  Today. Tomorrow. Next month. Next year. It’s our legacy.  Yours and mine, sisters and brothers.  Let’s do it!Thank you, and God bless you! And God bless the work you do!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
403,Trumka 2013 AFL-CIO Convention Acceptance,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-2013-afl-cio-convention-acceptance,9-11-2013,"Thank you, and God bless you. I'm honored by your support. And I'm humbled by your faith in me.What can I say about my brother and nominator Cecil Roberts? Thank you. I learn from you every single day.... I am and always will be UMWA, and proud to have you as my union president.
I owe a debt of gratitude, also, to my sister and the leader of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor... Maria Elena Durazo.... Thank you for your second. The same is true of my brother Lee Saunders of AFSCME. Lee, you have been a great partner in working together to grow the labor movement, and I thank you for it.And I am honored to serve with an outstanding team... with Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler... and Executive Vice-President Tefere Gebre. Thank you.I want to thank my family here with us today for your support, for your patience and for always--and I mean always--being there.Brothers and sisters, if we can see far... or do good works... or achieve lofty things ... any of us... it is because we stand on the shoulders of giants who have come before.Think of all the giants on whose shoulders we stand....I'm just one example that a man or woman can be carried far by those who came before.I think of my grandfathers, who were organizers with the United Mine Workers--my union.And I think of my father, who was a miner and an officer in that great union. I think of my union brothers and sisters who showed me the ropes, who taught me about life and unionism, who stood strong with me and for me when I was too young to even know what it meant to stand.All of us here are fortunate, lucky even. We have all of this... these unions of the AFL-CIO, this legacy.It's a gift we can only repay by giving it all... and more... to those who come along with us, and after us. That's why we're building a stronger, broader movement. We have a responsibility to lift others up, to give to those in need in this generation and in future generations what has already been given to us. And more.Because, sisters and brothers, tonight in America a child will be going to sleep with a stomach aching with hunger. And right now, a young person with not enough education and no hope of a job is gearing up to break the law. Right now, a proud but scared college graduate is wondering how on earth she'll pay her college loans. Right now, a hard-working immigrant who has done nothing wrong but seek a better life is sitting behind bars, waiting to be deported. Right now, a father is falling out of the middle class, facing the fact that he can't earn enough to raise his family the way he wants. A mother is struggling under the weight of life as a minimum wage-earner right now.Who will speak for them? Who will fight for them? We will.We will be the movement America needs us to be. Because we must be.My friends, right now, we will reach our brothers and sisters, our working families, our communities... right where they are... so every kid can get a fair shake for an excellent education and a good job, so we can eliminate the mass incarceration that stunts the lives of so many families and costs our society... and our people... so dearly. And so we all can share in the prosperity we create.My friends, we are a nation of immigrants. Immigrants are vital to the American Dream. And we must walk with today's immigrants every step of the way to comprehensive immigration reform with protection of workers' rights, including a real and workable path to citizenship.We are a nation of working people, and together we will stand tall, lift each other up until we rise as one, and speak as one. Because we are one people. One movement. Working together. Fighting together. Building together.Together we will march in solidarity to take America back from the corporations and make it a nation once again of the people, by the people and for the people.
That's the future we can have and will have and must have. That's the nation we'll live for and reach for and strive for, sisters and brothers, and we will not stop until we can say... without any doubt... that America works for the people who work! 
            That's why we're here together. That's why we are the AFL-CIO.Thank you again. God bless you.

404,Shuler 2013 AFL-CIO Convention Acceptance,https://aflcio.org/speeches/shuler-2013-afl-cio-convention-acceptance,9-10-2013,"Wow!  Thank you. Thank you all so much.Brothers and sisters.... It is a true joy to stand before you today, and I proudly accept your nomination to serve as Secretary-Treasurer for another four years.Before I do anything else I want to say thank you to Ed Hill.  As was the case four years ago, I can think of no single human being I'd rather have nominate me again today. President Hill you are a visionary leader, a genuine mentor, and a true friend. Thanks to my sisters in solidarity, Secretary-Treasurer Lynne Dodson of the Washington State Fed and Roxanne Brown of the United Steelworkers. Thank you all for the journey we are about to undertake together – building a new day for the labor movement.  And we are going to do it according to the first principle of labor – together in solidarity.Four years ago, I stood before you and pledged that my stewardship of the AFL-CIO's money --  your money, the money of your members --  would be carried out with a renewed commitment to transparency and accountability. We knew that we were not insulated from the pain of a troubled economy. Working families – our members -- took the biggest hit as the great recession gnawed away at their jobs, their health care, their very security. And this was on top of the relentless political attacks on collective bargaining. We knew our affiliates were tightening their belts –and that ours would have to be taken in a few notches as well. We got it, and we acted accordingly.So we scrutinized our finances to the smallest detail. We made tough choices and set priorities.  THE RESULT IS, as of the last fiscal year, we have a balanced budget. THE RESULT IS a 22-million-dollar turnaround in our net assets. The result is that our finances are being handled in accordance with the highest professional standards. As Secretary-Treasurer, this is my NUMBER ONE commitment to you.Thanks to the good work of the Finance Committee, together, we've met our responsibility, and we will not let up on our efforts. Our improved financial situation is a major step forward, but it is not a signal to relax our vigilance or loosen our standards. As we have heard throughout this convention and in Rich's rousing keynote, the AFL-CIO is on the move, tackling the most vital issues of the day, and we are better positioned now financially than we were four years ago.Of course, we're nowhere near out of the woods. We all know there will continue to be challenges ahead. And we re-commit ourselves to the principles of transparency and accountability that have gotten us this far.Four years ago, I also talked about the need to redefine how the public sees unions. To put it plainly, we've got an image problem. Rich asked me to lead the effort to change the perception of the labor movement in the hearts and minds of the public. Our opponents have done a great job creating a disconnect between what labor unions do – and what the public thinks we do. It's gotten to the point where our message rings hollow in the ears of those who need to hear it the most.The answer is not to get frustrated with the people outside our movement who just don't ""get it"" and don't automatically understand our value. The answer is to engage those people where they live.  To help them see that our core values are the same as theirs – values like equality...fairness...patriotism...and hard work. Our answer is to show them, that work connects us all.We've made a strong start – identifying 8 principles to drive the project, strategies that work and creative partnerships with Univision, Upworthy – an online social sharing site for young people -- Blogher and Jezebel. We did things that worked spectacularly and things that maybe didn't work so well. But the bottom line is, we have to try new things.  We knew going in that this would be a long term initiative. It took decades to lose public confidence, and we will not regain it in a week, a month, or a year. This will be a sustained, dedicated effort, and we must keep it moving forward.The last area we talked about in Pittsburgh is the critical need to engage young workers in the labor movement – to listen to their concerns and give them a sense of belonging and ownership. This has been probably the most rewarding part of the job so far and the most challenging!Our NextUp program has created new paths, new networks – and yes, new twitter feeds -- for young workers to engage in their unions and local labor federations. It has sparked young people's imaginations, and given them the tools and skills they need to organize and lead the fight for their future. I don't have the words to fully describe the feeling when you see the light in a young person's eyes... when they realize that their desire to be part of something bigger than themselves is within reach... when they see that they have power. Let's harness that power – and bring the old school and the new school together in solidarity!I will go anywhere and talk to anyone who will listen about the energy and optimism of young workers and their critical role in the next wave of our movement. And I'm proud to do this work with the Young Worker Advisory Council, with so many of our affiliates and with dozens of Young Worker Groups across the country. I'm not even going to try to list them all.And through all of this work, I am drawn again and again into conversations about how we can stand up for working people in new and different ways. With young people, it's often about new forms of communication – tweets and texts not phone and email. With women, it's about new forms of labor standards like paid sick days or different models of leadership development. And, with unions more generally, it's about how we can use technology to our advantage or think about old challenges in new ways. My hope for the next four years is to identify and promote these kinds of innovations that put the labor movement on the leading edge of workplace change. Above all, it has been a great honor to be part of a leadership team that has given working people a new, stronger voice. It has been a privilege to stand together with my teammates – Rich, your passion for this movement inspires me everyday. Arlene, I'll miss you and simply say, you're a giant. And I look forward to working with Tefere Gebre.  I know his great work in Orange County and can't wait to have his energy and creativity in D.C.Time does not allow me to do justice in giving thanks to all those whose love, friendship and support made it possible for me to stand here before you today. My loving husband, David Herbst, is my rock and is my partner in all things – who stays up with me until all hours of the night, fine-tuning my speeches!  My parents, Lance Shuler and my late mother Joyce, who together instilled the values of hard work and compassion in me and whose love made me the person I am today. My sister Anna and her husband Ansis, and my sweet nephews Roland and Lance...I'm so grateful for your support and advice and a gentle shove when needed. And my IBEW family – you know who you are, and I love you all.Brothers and sisters, the road is long.  The obstacles are daunting.  But we are armed with the greatest tool of all – the truth – the truth of justice and dignity and solidarity.  So let us continue the journey. Let's go forward from Los Angeles and bring our truth to all those who work for a living and hope for a brighter day.Thank you.

405,Gebre 2013 AFL-CIO Convention Acceptance,https://aflcio.org/speeches/gebre-2013-afl-cio-convention-acceptance,9-10-2013,"Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your confidence in me. And I want to thank Joe Hansen, MaryBe McMillan and Doug Moore for your moving nominations.Let me express a deeply felt gratitude and thank Rich Trumka and Liz Shuler for having faith in me and inviting me to help lead this movement I love. A movement, without any doubt moving in the right direction. A labor movement positioned to speak, fight and win for all workers.I also want to recognize my family, some of whom traveled from far away to witness this moment. My mother, who is 81 years old, my sisters Nisihit, my nephew Yonathan.
My mother in-law and sisters in-law who came from Wisconsin to be with me today. And the rest of my family who are here.And to my beautiful wife Jennifer, who is my best friend and a great trade unionist on her own, thank you for being you.To my union family from Orange County, you are in my heart, and will always be in my heart. Together, we have built a labor movement in a county no one ever imagined would be possible.Thirty years ago, as a 14 year old Ethiopian child, not only did I dream of America, I started a journey to live out my dreams. That's when a few other friends and I decided to escape the horrors of war and a brutal military government and walked for weeks across the desert to the Sudan. I lived in a Sudanese refugee camp, until I was given a once in a life time opportunity to come to America as a political refugee. At the tender age of 15, I started a brand new life in this city of angels. I graduated from high school not far away from this convention center, at Belmont High. To say life as a teen in LA, without having a parent, or any relative, was not easy would be an understatement. I had to work a full-time job in a liquor store, getting paid cash under the table, studying to be the best student I could be and trying every sport possible in hopes of getting an athletic scholarship. I was lucky, I became a good distance runner, good enough to gain a full track and field scholarship.This is not just MY story. It's a story of millions who proudly call America home. Documented and undocumented, the immigrant story is what makes this country of ours so special.Once in college, at Cal Poly Pomona, I took a night shift job as a loader for UPS. That's where I got a chance to work my first union job, a job where my rights at work were respected. Where I learned I had a protective shield called collective bargaining.And so, I stand before you today. I stand before you knowing no political party is our salvation. Our salvation won't come from political consultants or polling firms. Our salvation comes from our solidarity and the work we do with those who share our common values in the community.Brothers and sisters, I am ready to work. With Rich and Liz, I am ready to work for an America that I dreamed of. For an America that values work and honors those who do the work.You see, the America I dreamed about expands voting rights, instead of going back to the dark days of systemic discrimination. My beloved America doesn't value the 1st amendment rights of corporations any more than those of the coal miner in West Virginia or the carwash worker in Los Angeles. My beloved America doesn't fire workers for wanting to have a voice at work.So today, I pledge to you to follow the lead of our leader Rich Trumka and fight not for what is convenient, but for what is right.To my brothers and sisters in local labor movements, state federations and CLCs, I am one of you. I know how hard your job is, and how important your role is. Each of us has the responsibility to convene the labor movement in our own communities – across unions and sectors and to work in real partnership with allies in the community. That's what we do –and when we are at our best, the labor movement can lead. We need to be at our best, and I pledge to you that I will always be there to listen, advise and help our CLCs and state federations be the best we can be.I am being asked to fill the shoes of my hero, Arlene Holt Baker. Arlene, thank you for being so strong. Thank you for a life of service not only to the labor movement, but to all who seek justice. You have been a great ambassador of our movement. I know you are not going away and we are all lucky that you will be around leading, teaching and fighting for voting rights, workers' rights and everything in between.I want to close with this. This is not about me. It's a call from a new labor movement unmistakably saying no matter what your accent, no matter what your skin color, no matter how far from here you were born, come not only to join our movement, but lead it.Thank you again for your trust in me and let's go to work!

406,Trumka 2013 AFL-CIO Convention Keynote,https://aflcio.org/speeches/trumka-2013-afl-cio-convention-keynote,9-9-2013,"Thank you. Thank you for being here.  Together.  In Solidarity. Look around this great hall.  Look at the power represented in this hall. And so the real question for this week is, what are we going to do with it?  Do we intend to build an American future, a future for the 99% -- a future for our children and grandchildren that doesn’t just seek to restore the best of our past, but seeks to outdo all we have done before?First, let’s be clear about where we are today.  We used to say that what made America special was -- if you worked hard and did your part, you had a real good shot at reaching the middle class—that the working class was the middle class.  And that you might work in a coal mine or a hotel laundry, but your children could do anything if they worked hard enough.This is the story of my own life.  My grandfather went into the mine hungry, my father helped build his union and fought for our country.  Together, and with help from our union, my parents and I were able to earn the money to send me to college and to law school.Now, I talk to a lot of people as I go around the country, and many of you in this hall do too.  And it’s clear something’s changed.  The truth is, who your parents are—really, what your parents have -- matters more than it once did.  And the people I talk to don’t say, “I’m middle class” so much anymore.  They say “I work, if I can find a job.”  They say, “Middle class?  That’s what my parents were.”What makes somebody middle class in America?  A good job—a job that pays a living wage, with health care and retirement security, a safe job, a job that leads somewhere.  It’s that simple.   But the working class is not the middle class any more.Here’s the truth we live every day:  We work harder, we work longer hours, we create more—more goods, more services, more of everything—and yet most of us earn less.  Less than we earned five years ago. Less than we earned 15 years ago.  Barely more than we earned 35 years ago.   Our biggest employers -- Walmart, McDonalds—their whole business model is about keeping the people who work for them poor.  And Wall Street cheers them on.But this is a rich country.  So, where’s all the money going?  Think back over the last 15 years—think of all the work you did, all your members did, all your friends and neighbors and family did.  Now understand that all of the wage increases over all those years—not some, not the majority, not the vast majority—ALL—went to the top 10%.  Incomes of the rest of us—90% of America—went down.  And those who did the best were those who were at the top already—the top 1%.This is upside down.  Since 2009, the pay of America’s corporate CEOs has gone up nearly 40%.  Imagine for a second what kind of country we would live in if ordinary people’s incomes had increased like CEO’s.  Almost no one would live in poverty. It is time, my friends, to turn America right side up.  And to turn America right side up, we need a real working class movement.  And if that’s going to happen, we -- our institutions -- have to do some things differently. We must begin, here and now, today, the great work of reawakening a movement of working people—all working people, not just the people in this hall, not just the people we represent today—but everyone who works in this country, everyone who believes that people who work deserve to make enough to live and enjoy the good things in life.Now, we can come together at this convention and shout all day long about how corporations and the rich and Wall Street did this to us.  About the Koch Brothers and their war on working people.  About nasty little conspiracies like the American Legislative Exchange Council.  About the Supreme Court and its war on democracy.  And it’s true, there are powerful forces in America today who want our country to be run by and for the rich, forces that have systematically stripped workers of power and pushed wages and benefits down. But greed and privilege and hate have always been with us. The question is, what are we going to do about it?  We are 13 million strong—we are today, as we have been since the time of Abraham Lincoln, the biggest, strongest, best organized force for economic justice in America.  But we are a small part of the 150 million Americans who work for a living.  We cannot win economic justice only for ourselves, for union members alone.  It would not be right and it’s not possible.  All working people will rise together, or we will keep falling together.And what is true for America is doubly true around the world.  A global economy means all workers, in all countries, are bound together—we have always had the same hopes and the same dreams, now we have the same employers, the same vastly powerful global corporations, the same borderless financial firms, the same union busting lawyers and management consultants, the same right wing political operatives.  They will never stop pitting us against each other until we stop letting them.  Shared prosperity around this beautiful world is within our grasp, but only if we link arms.We have to start here at home.  Because the AFL-CIO and the unions that make up this Federation exist to make real the promise of America for all working people.   If, instead, workers create more and earn less, our children go homeless while housing sits empty, our bridges fall down while our bridge builders sit idle—then we must ask ourselves—how must we change—how must we reignite our movement?  Not so we can have bigger unions—but so we can together make all working peoples’ lives better. Brothers and sisters, this convention—not me, not the Executive Council—this Convention is the ultimate governing body of the AFL-CIO.  It is in our power, here in this Hall, to move forward and build a movement.  A movement strong enough to raise up the values that built this country. This is America—it’s time we value work—not wealth, not greed.  Work.  And the people who do the work.Four years ago in Pittsburgh, you elected Liz Shuler, Arlene Holt Baker and me.  We knew we faced great challenges.  But we didn’t know how great they would be.  We knew we faced rising unemployment.  But we didn’t know mass unemployment would still be with us four years later.  We knew the Republican Party had become more hostile to working people—we didn’t realize we would be facing a concerted effort to destroy collective bargaining and wipe out our unions—all of our unions—private and public sector—in state after state. Though these battles are still raging, we have not been dealt the death blow people like John Kasich wanted.  In these four years of almost constant battle, we have learned to fight smarter and we have learned to ask more of ourselves.  In state after state, and city after city, we came together and we beat them back.  But we didn’t win every fight.  And our movement as a whole is still shrinking.  As it was before anyone had ever heard of Scott Walker or Rick Snyder.  If we are going to succeed in our great task of lifting up America’s working people from a generation of wage stagnation, our labor movement has got to change. Because the success of our movement is not measured in the members we organize, or the politicians we elect.  It is measured by the progress of working people—all working people--by the lives we lead, by the hopes and dreams we make real together.As we approached this Convention, we knew we didn’t have all the answers.  We thought we should ask you, the leaders and activists of our movement and the working people we all represent, How should we change?  And we wanted to involve everyone who shares our values and cares about what happens to America’s workers.  And so we held hundreds of conversations and listening sessions at every level of the labor movement and with academics and with our friends and allies. One union member put it better than I could—“The working class is not shrinking, it is our wages and benefits that are shrinking.”Another said, “We need a union culture shift that will turn the labor movement back into a movement that fights for the interest of all working people.” We heard that all over America, workers are organizing in all kinds of ways, and they call their unity by all kinds of names—workers’ unions, associations, centers, networks.We heard that people want to be part of our movement but it’s too hard to join – that we have to change so that our unions and our movement are open to everyone -- to anyone who wants to join together for a better life.   And today we’re going to do that.We heard that we have to change to reflect the times.  The AFL and the CIO merged over 50 years ago, before the jumbo jet, before the cell phone, before the internet.  We need to organize ourselves in ways that fit with the jobs people do now and how our economy works now.And finally, we heard we have to make our unity real with action—we have to be able to organize on a large scale, in the workplace and in political life—quickly, efficiently, decisively.  And with a strong, independent political voice. And in everything we do, we have to join together with partners and allies who share our values and our vision for America.  An America of shared prosperity.  An America where you don’t surrender your humanity, your dignity, your rights when you come to work.  An America where we honor each individual, while understanding that connecting with each other,  supporting each other—solidarity and community—are what give life meaning.My friends, it is time for a new and stronger movement. What we’ve done yesterday cannot limit what we do tomorrow. Now is not the time to settle for small steps.If we are going to move forward, we have to challenge ourselves. Throughout history, the energy and hopes of young workers have powered progress:   If we are going to move forward, we must truly open our doors to the next generation.If we are going to move forward, we must make our movement and our leadership as diverse as the workforce we speak for.       If we are going to move forward, we must move forward together—immigrants and the children of immigrants.Politicians and employers want to divide us.  They want to tell us who can be in the labor movement and who can’t.  We can’t let them. Our answer to Scott Walker and Walmart and the Koch Brothers and every other apostle of greed who seeks to divide us must not just be “no,” it must be “hell no.” If you work for a living in this country, our movement is your movement. Sisters and brothers, it’s time to tear down the barriers, remove the boundaries between workers.  It’s time to stop letting employers and politicians tell us who is a worker and who isn’t, who’s in our movement and who isn’t.  Working people alone should decide who’s in the labor movement.In the three and a half days we will spend together, we’ll hear workers’ voices from around the country and around the world—brothers and sisters so brave you will be brought to tears.  And we have a full agenda of action, of change.  As I said yesterday, we set up three special Committees just for this convention, and we asked rank and file workers, community allies and academics to join us.  We also set up special committees on resolutions, governance and finance.  We asked members of the Executive Council to lead this work.  And we asked a lot.  I want to express my thanks to everyone in this hall who served on a Convention committee.  We could not be where we are today without all your hard work.And so in the days to come we’ll take up resolutions that change the way this Federation works, resolutions that will open our doors and make us stronger and better able to give voice to all working people, and then we’ll take up resolutions that lay out how we will use the power we have and the power we will buildto make the lives of all working people  better. Everything we do this week will be part of a strategy for winning broadly shared prosperity. Because the power to shape the economy is in OUR hands.  The economy is not the weather.  The wealth we make every day can build a future of shared prosperity, but only if we build the bigger, broader movement that can wrest the future from those who would seek simply to make the rich richer. There can be no shared prosperity while 11 million aspiring Americans have no rights. There can be no shared prosperity while 20 million people look for work and can’t find it. There can be no shared prosperity while politicians terrify our parents and grandparents with threats to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits-- the economic security they earned. There can be no shared prosperity while millions of young men, disproportionately African-American, labor in prisons instead of in school or at work. There can be no shared prosperity while mayors and governors of both parties close schools and libraries in our poorest communities.Shared prosperity means building a country that can compete in the 21stcentury and help lift nations and people around the world.  Investing in our infrastructure, our educational system, our manufacturing base.Shared prosperity means insisting that the rich, the powerful, the privileged and the connected pay their fair share.  And it means no more tax deals for companies that outsource jobs overseas.Shared prosperity means health care for all, and retirement security for all.Shared prosperity means paid sick days for all.Shared prosperity means a global economy built on rising pay for all who labor, and an end to trade deals that treat corporations better than people.Shared prosperity means an economy built from the middle out.But hear this:  Shared prosperity is nothing but a dream until we have democracy—the right to organize and bargain collectively with employers, the right to vote and have that vote counted.  The right to govern together with our fellow citizens and be free of the power of concentrated wealth.Those are the ideas behind each of our convention actions.  And yet, these resolutions are nothing more than pieces of paper if we don’t change what we actually do.And that’s why I’m asking you for more. I’m asking you to take what we say and do these next few days into your hearts.  To go home not satisfied with what we have said, but hungry for action.  Hungry for action everywhere you go and in everything you do.  Because, brothers and sisters, our voices-- the voices of everyone who works—in every language—must be clear:We build this country.  We build it every day.  And it is time for America to value our work.Sisters and brothers, we do the work of America.  We heal the sick and fight the fires, build the bridges, clean the homes, write the software, and teach the children.  We mine the iron and coal, forge steel, build the trucks, and drive the buses. We design, build, fly, repair and clean the airplanes.  We keep the lights turned on and the internet connected, the trains moving, the water flowing to your tap, and the movies playing in your multiplex.  Our movement is as old as our nation, and as new as the immigrant hotel worker, the apprentice, the new teacher coming to work for the first time. So at the end of the day, it's on us to build a movement not for the 99 percent, but of the 99%.  Not just the 11% we are right now.  The 99%.More than 50 years ago Dr. Martin Luther King spoke to the 4th AFL-CIO Constitutional Convention.  He said to us:“We are confronted by powerful forces telling us to rely on the good will and understanding of those who profit by exploiting us.  They deplore our discontent, they resent our will to organize, so that we may guarantee that humanity will prevail.”Dr. King did not hold a union card.  He was not a member of any affiliate.  But he walked down a line of National Guard bayonets with us.  And he died in Memphis with our union brothers and sisters – summoned by their discontent and their will to organize. And what about us?  You and me?  What about OUR discontent? OUR will to organize?Are we ready to say, no more working harder for less?No more jobs you can’t live on!No more sitting on the bench, while our bridges are falling down!No more politicians in hock to Wall Street!No more closed classrooms while our country cries for education!No more!It is time to turn America right side up!It is time to build the working class movement that can do it. Look around you.  Where else in America do teachers sit with electricians, firefighters with actors, engineers with laborers?    Look around you—this hall is filled with working class heroes.And all across our country, all across our world, people with a will to organize are ready to join with us.  And together we will turn America right side up. Together -- like the courageous members of UNITE HERE at Hyatt Hotels …who made one of America’s largest companies value their work.  Some of them are here with us -- come join me here!Together -- like the taxi workers in New York and a dozen other cities—the law says they can’t organize—but they’re building power together every day in the National Taxi Workers Alliance. Together -- like the brave workers from the OUR Walmart campaign.  Their fight is our fight— and together we will win.Together -- with the 3 million working men and women of Working America.Together with our veterans—talk about working class heroes—here with us today are veterans who  served in the Air Force and the Marines in Iraq – now, thanks to the Building Trades Helmets to Hardhats program, they’re union plumbers -- come join us here!Together with our children’s teachers—they serve our country too--from Head Start to high school!Together with day laborers, forming solidarity on street corners,  and with domestic workers—caring across generations and organizing all across the world. Together with the Dreamers whose struggle for a fair and just immigration system has inspired our nation!Together with AFSCME, whose work to organize EMTs is strengthening vital public services.Together with car wash workers organizing for justice for some of the lowest paid workers in our country … because the American dream lives in all of us. Together with our brothers and sisters in the USW, working every day for safe and healthy workplaces …. and UAW members, fighting for middle class manufacturing in America.Together with courageous new Americans … Here with us are a father and son who fled the violence of Colombia and won their U.S. citizenship with the help of the Orange County Labor Federation – now they’re working to win rights for all. Together with young workers like OPEIU members here today, organizing for the hopes of a new generation … and proud workers like the retired mineworkers fighting for a fair and decent retirement after a lifetime of work.Brothers and sisters, I am so proud to stand with the working men and women gathered here.  And I am so honored to serve together with all of YOU. Look around you. Look at the workers gathered here.  This is America’s soul.  Our future.  As a movement.  As a nation. Our challenge, our responsibility – yours and mine -- is to join together with millions more like us to build real power.  Will you do it together? Our job is to create a new working class movement strong enough to lift up ALL workers in this country.  Will you do it together? The way we honor these American heroes, sisters and brothers, is not with talk but with action.  With innovation.  Are you ready to get started?  Are you ready? Okay, let’s turn to action.  And before we do, let’s recognize these heroes one more time for their courage and commitment

407,"Remarks of AFL-CIO President Richard L. Trumka, 2013 LCLAA Summit - Opening Breakfast, Los Angeles",https://aflcio.org/speeches/remarks-afl-cio-president-richard-l-trumka-2013-lclaa-summit-opening-breakfast-los-angeles,9-6-2013,"Thank you for all for coming together here in Los Angeles, and thank you for that kind introduction. This is the right time for the Latino labor movement to hold a summit, because we are at a critical point for working people in America, and that goes double for Latino workers.First, I want to tell you how important the work that you’re doing is. You’re the heart and soul of America’s labor movement.  So many of you do your LCLAA work as volunteers, on top of your day jobs. And so I’d like to thank you for what you do, and what you are.The truth is that America needs your efforts. We all know the economic and social life of working people in the United States has become hard, but we also know America has no equal opportunity hardships. The numbers tell us all we need to know. The workplace and economic challenges for immigrant workers, Latino workers, and especially Latinas, are some of the hardest.Latina women work harder, earn less, endure more harassment, suffer more wage theft, higher unemployment and higher under-employment than any other demographic group in the nation. One in every three employed Latinas lacks health insurance. Latinas suffer twice the rate of workplace fatalities of the workforce at large, and half of those women who died were victims of assaults or violent acts -- half!These numbers are unacceptable.All this is happening on our watch! We bear the legacy of the men and women who built the American middle class with activism and unionism. And I ask you: Are we living up to that legacy? Have we done everything possible to offer a better and a stronger labor movement for Latinos?  For America’s new immigrants?My friends, at the AFL-CIO we have spent the better part of the last year planning for this convention by listening to friends and allies and each other – we held hundreds of listening sessions in which many thousands of people participated.  We studied what we’re doing right, and looked for areas where we need to improve. Many of you have taken part in those conversations, and I thank you for it. But I want you all to know that the real work begins after this convention, because our movement truly needs to change. We need to make our labor movement fit the needs of working people today. It’s time for us to choose to change.You see, we stand at a crossroads. We must begin to heal our communities. Latinos need the strength and solidarity of our labor movement, not just the 2 million Latino union members but all 55 million Latinos in America. We must commit ourselves to building a broad and deep movement of all working people, so all of us together can stand up for a voice on the job, and in our democracy, so we can win what we need from the worksite to Capitol Hill, and that includes true immigration reform with a workable path to citizenship, and so we can all live and work with dignity and respect.Here, at this summit and over the coming days at this convention, I am asking you to dig deep and truly look for new and better ways the union movement can reach out to Latinos and Latinas, so we can work together to improve pay and win good benefits, so we can meet the needs of the Latino community, to protect our democracy, and our public institutions, and our workers, so we can pass on a better life to our children and grandchildren.America needs hard work to be rewarded by fair pay. That's the ground level of the American Dream, and it's not too much to ask!Together, we can turn bad jobs into good jobs. Together, all of us are building a forward-looking movement—a winning movement. That’s how we’ll take our country back, because working men and women make America run! We staff the stores and stock the shelves, we build the bridges and make the steel, we clean the streets and fly the planes. We answer the call. We rise to the task. We do what it takes, no matter the price. Because this is our America! And we’re taking it back!America is changing, my friends. The workplace is evolving, and so is the American workforce. Latinos are the fastest growing segment of our population, and it’s on us to seize the opportunities presented by this change. At no time in the past century has union density in the private-sector been as low as it is today. Our American labor movement is truly in crisis.Yet there’s another way to look at the picture of American labor. At no time in the past century, or at least since the Great Depression, has the demand for workable solutions for working people been as high as it is today, and that, too, goes double for Latino workers.The possibilities for growth are enormous. It’s our job to get ready to grow. That’s why, all across the labor movement, we’re looking hard at our local infrastructure. We’re professional-izing our central labor councils and state and area federations of labor. We’re looking at the ways we partner with allies and like-minded organizations. We’re trying to do better. We need to do better. And we will do better.And I believe we have major opportunities to grow with LCLAA, and I want to commend you for putting an emphasis on building the strength and growing the capacity of your local chapters. That’s an absolutely critical element.With stronger chapters, LCLAA will be able to create more bridges between labor and our communities. That’s absolutely crucial right now. That’s how we spread the word about what labor is really about. And when that happens, things start to click.You see, there’s a lot of confusion in America about how our economy works. If you watch the news and listen to Congress, you’d think the economy changes like the weather, as if it’s out of our control. To be honest with you, that’s partly our fault. We haven’t been educating people. We don’t explain enough that working people are the engine of America’s job growth. And it’s our responsibility to set the record straight with a clear-eyed discussion of how and why our economy works better when each and every one of us does better.We can have those conversations, because each LCLAA chapter offers the labor movement a window into the Latino community, and an avenue through which Latino issues can be taken up and addressed by the entire community of working families in America.My friends, the values of our labor movement are Latino values, just as Latino values are mainstream American values. We share a common and fundamental belief that all of us, no matter what we look like, where our parents come from, or how much money we have -- all of us deserve basic dignity and respect.Sisters and brothers, collective action works, collective bargaining works. And when our movement begins to grow and wages begin to rise, we will build prosperity and economic growth—the kind of broad, sustainable prosperity that rises from a virtuous cycle of investment that fuels innovation, that fuels more investment.We’ll stand for it. We’ll fight for it. We’ll stand together -- shoulder to shoulder. And I promise you, we will keep marching, keep fighting, until we restore a record of winning for the American labor movement, and for all working people!Because we have come too far to be turned back now.  We won't back up. We won't back down. We won't be turned aside. Working people built this country. Together—all of us—and we will not be denied!And finally, brothers and sisters, history will not judge us by the resolutions we adopt at this summit or this convention, but rather by the action we take when we return to our homes and our workplaces.It truly is time for us to change, to update and to take every chance to innovate. And if you take away one thing from my remarks today, and from this convention, I want it to be this: We’re done with “business-as-usual.” That’s not good enough anymore. We’re done with it. We’re ready for a new day.My friends, we intend to win, because when we win, America wins! Every victory for working people supports the American middle class. And that’s the change we want to see!Expect change! Expect a day soon when workers -- all workers -- Latinos and Latinas are recognized for the contributions we make to our society, our economy and our communities.We’ll march for it. We’ll stand for it. We’ll stand together, with solidarity, real solidarity, the kind where you protect my right to vote, and I help you win the jobs you want and need, and we pick each other up when we fall, and we all march on together.Let every working person in America and around the world know together we will honor the freedom to turn bad jobs into good jobs, let every working person know,  if you stand with us, when you need us, we’ll stand with you.We’re ready. We won’t back up, and we won’t back down.Because we know how to win.  We know how to last.God bless you, and God bless America!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
408,"Remarks of AFL-CIO President Richard L. Trumka, 2013 Maritime Trades Executive Board Meeting, Los Angeles, California",https://aflcio.org/speeches/remarks-afl-cio-president-richard-l-trumka-2013-maritime-trades-executive-board-meeting,9-5-2013,"Thank you, Mike [Sacco]. It’s great to be with you, my brother. Thank you for inviting me to speak again to your board meeting. It’s always an honor.Brothers and sisters, welcome to Los Angeles, and welcome to the 2013 Quadrennial Convention of the AFL-CIO. This is an historic time in the American labor movement, and as leaders in our movement, we have a lot of work to do, a lot of work. And I am honored, and humbled, and gladdened, to do that work alongside this man right here, Mike Sacco! Some of you probably know this already, but Mike Sacco is the most senior vice president of the AFL-CIO on our executive council. This is a man who has seen a lot of the past and yet is always looking to the future.  The last time I spoke to you all, I spent a few minutes recalling the past, some of the victories that helped shape me and Mike, and my vision -- our vision -- for working people in America.Well, we’re rolling up our sleeves. We’ve got a plan of action. And we’re ready to get to work. Brothers and sisters, I want you to know we are asking for some significant changes at the AFL-CIO convention this year. We’re looking at what we really need to do, at retooling our labor movement, on a fundamental level, both with our partners and allies, and within the big union we call the AFL-CIO.As a movement, we need to change.We truly need to become a movement by, and for, and of, working people -- not just some working people -- but all working people.True solidarity is an art, and sometimes it seems there is no perfect route to achieve it. But we have to try. And our efforts at this convention represent the best ideas from a lot of sources, from the unions of the AFL-CIO, from hundreds of listening sessions involving many thousands of members and friends and allies and academics. It represents the sum total of a whole host of powerful visions for the way forward.And let me say, sometimes good people disagree on tactics, some already have, and others will. That’s OK. That’s how we know the issues at stake are the right ones. We should have passionate arguments, even fights, as long as our struggles remain ultimately constructive. At the end of the day, we all have the same goal in mind.And yet, my friends, there are no guarantees. I cannot promise that we’ll get everything we want. But, I can promise, I, and Secretary Treasurer Liz Shuler, together with each and every one of you, will work hard, and honestly, and with everything we have.I believe history will look on this convention as a turning point -- not necessarily because of the work we do here, but because of what we do afterwards, when our tasks become real. I’m asking you to join me in that effort.Sisters and brothers, we must answer America’s call. Our nation has been torn down and torn apart. We have to rebuild, almost from the ground up. We have to rebuild our middle class with good jobs, with union jobs, with smart investments, and hard work. There are no easy answers. No silver bullet. There never has been.What we want is not too much to ask. A good chance for a decent life, for every single worker, every worker. Fair wages. Health care. A secure retirement. Education and a better life for our kids and grandkids.That’s not too much to ask for the working people who wake America up every morning and tuck her into bed at night. That’s not too much to ask.Brothers and sisters, we’re going to take our country back, because we dredge the harbors and pilot the ships, we load the trucks and build the roads. We will rebuild America, because this is our nation -- red, white and blue -- and we will do what it takes to lift our country up, no matter what the price, no matter how high the cost, because we have come too far to be turned back now. We won't back up. We won't back down. We won't be turned aside. And we will not be denied!When I look on the national political landscape, one of the biggest X factors I see is the reawakening of working people. And it’s about time.Because we live under the very real threat that the America of today could become two Americas -- the super-rich and the rest of us. The wealth divide is greater today than any time in a century, and it’s growing by the day. Between 1979 and 2011, 84% of America’s income gains went to the wealthiest 1%.Sisters and brothers, I ask you to think about the people not in this hall with us, but out there in America, working hard for next to nothing, for a minimum wage which doesn’t even come close to providing the minimum for life, for the people working and living the desperate reality of our dismal new economy.Why doesn’t a young single mom have a voice in our economy? Who will stand with her as she looks for solutions? Who will stand with the former telecom worker who’s wearing the headset and taking orders at the drive-thru?I’ll tell you who will stand with that single-mom, and with her children, and with laid off workers, and underpaid workers. We will! All of us together.  And we’ll do it right now! We’ll join together with everyone and anyone who wants to stand with us. And we’ll raise our voices together, until our voices become one voice!And with one voice we will demand that all work have dignity, that every worker has health care, every child a good education and enough to eat. We want every worker to have a job and fair pay and a secure retirement.Here in Los Angeles, and in our nation’s capital, and here and there around the nation, our labor movement is reaching out to people who need the strength of solidarity, productive workers who want to get ahead, and are willing to rise above the petty and abusive tactics of bad managers and corporate CEOs.And in Washington, we have gained some traction on Capitol Hill. We have held firm on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and we have five confirmed members on the National Labor Relations Board.  But can we meet the needs of the future? Can we undo what the Tea Party has done to the politics of our nation?My friends, the road forward won’t be easy, and we need solutions. History won’t wait. The work of the Panama Canal continues apace, yet our East Coast ports are not prepared. Our harbors need dredging. Our roads and bridges and railways need upgrades and repair. We’re not ready for the big ships that are coming! We need to modernize to be competitive.We don’t have time for piecemeal solutions. We need big and bold answers to America’s problems. I’m talking about trillions with a T. Trillions!We want business to succeed, so our young people can find work, good jobs, jobs to raise a family and build a career!And my friends, to get it done, we’ll use the same tools that worked in the past. Activism!  Activism works.  Unity! We’ll stand with anyone who wants to stand with us. We’ll raise our voices with everyone who wants to raise their voice with us. We will stand together, at the workplace, and on Election Day. We’ll march together in Albany, Portland and Corpus Christi and everywhere we need to be.We have a vision for the future, and it’s called the American Dream.It was good enough for the men and women who built our labor movement, who built the greatest middle class the world has ever known, and it’s good enough for us!It’s a simple dream, and it’s beautiful. And we won’t settle for anything less. It’s not too much to ask. It’s the basic idea that if you work hard, you can get ahead. You can save a little and raise a family if you want one, earn health care, and look forward to a secure retirement.We’ll march for it. We’ll fight for it. We’ll stand for it. And by damn, we’ll win for it!
Sisters and brothers, we’re motivated. We’re activated. We’re energized. And, frankly, the time has come for us to act. 
 We will climb this hill and we will win -- together! We’re going to do what it takes, and keep doing it, until it works, and until America works for the people who work in America.America’s labor unions and America’s working people are in a tough place. There will be no easy answers. If there were, we’d have done them by now.The most important progress has never come easy. That’s why it’s the most important.But we do have a vision to guide us. And a powerful movement to build. We have friends and allies all over this nation. We’re no fringe group with special interests. We’re the mainstream, my friends, and we’re ready to act like it.A common thread unites our issues -- issues like comprehensive immigration reform and protecting Social Security and Medicare, and fighting for a functional National Labor Relations Board. These are issues that matter to the lives and jobs of regular working people. These issues matter. Our rights matter. Our people matter. And we will fight to protect our right to vote, and our rights on the job.Like I said, it won’t be easy.But to make it happen, we’ve got to want it, we’ve got to work for it.We have to stand for it. We’ve got to fight for it.We’ll bring out the best in our county. And in ourselves. To build the future we know we can have, we must have, for each of us, for our children, for our grandchildren. And we will never, ever, give up. We will always, always, go forward.  And together, we will win, for our children,  for our families, for our future, for our country.  That’s how we’ll go forward. That’s how we’ll win. Together! Together!Thank you! And God bless you!© 2023 AFL-CIO. All rights reserved.",Trumka
